Roads leading to the area were closed off in the afternoon to allow the demonstrations to proceed. Police called on all demonstrators to observe health guidelines during their demonstrations.

News article:
Israeli police dispersed dozens of protesters outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's official residence on Thursday ahead of a rally attended by hundreds of his supporters. The protests come amid bitter infighting within the unity government formed in May. Netanyahu and his rival-turned-coalition partner Benny Gantz face an Aug. 25 deadline to agree on a budget to avert early elections _ the fourth in less than two years. Some of the protesters, including a former head of the Shin Bet internal security service, chained themselves to roadblocks before police unbound them and dragged them away. ``Clearing part of the encampment is a violent act against the protesters,'' Carmi Gillon, the former Shin Bet chief, was quoted as saying by the Haaretz newspaper. ``The right to protest is a right I will not allow to be taken away from me.'' He raised his arms as he was led away, showing what appeared to be bruising and scrapes. Netanyahu's supporters later held their rally amid a heavy police presence, with no immediate reports of arrests or violence. Protesters have staged a series of demonstrations this summer calling on Netanyahu to resign over corruption charges and criticizing the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout. Police have clashed with protesters on a number of occasions and used water cannons to clear them off of main streets and squares, though in recent weeks the gatherings have been calmer. Netanyahu has vowed to remain in office despite being charged last year with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three long-running corruption investigations. He has rejected the allegations as a ``witch hunt'' and lashed out at the judiciary, law enforcement and media. He has also faced anger over the coronavirus outbreak, which has worsened since authorities abruptly lifted a nationwide lockdown in May. Israel has reported more than 99,200 cases, including at least 795 deaths, since the pandemic began. The economy, meanwhile, has struggled, with unemployment remaining over 20% despite the reopening of most businesses. If the government does not pass a budget by Tuesday, then elections would automatically be called. Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party and Gantz's centrist Blue and White battled to a stalemate in the previous three elections, leading to more than a year of gridlock and uncertainty. Recent polls show the Likud with a sizable lead, and dissolving the government would save Netanyahu from handing over the premiership to Gantz in November 2021, as required by the coalition agreement. Netanyahu appears determined to remain in office through the duration of his trial, which is expected to last several years. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Thousands of Israelis demonstrated Friday in front of the prime minister's official residence in Jerusalem, demanding the resignation of Benjamin Netanyahu. The anti-Netanyahu protests have been drawing hundreds of frustrated citizens to Balfour street every Friday night for about two months. A protest camp in front of the prime minister's residence was forcibly evacuated by the police Thursday, to allow for the separation between the left-wing demonstrators and Netanyahu supporters who came out for a counter-protest, assuming that thousands of right-wing Israelis would participate, however, only about 300 did. The police forcefully removed about ten activists from the protest camp who chained themselves to nearby roadblocks, including former Shin Bet chief Carmi Gillon, who was dragged by the police and injured. Additionally, dozens of other protesters were removed, and one was injured and sought medical treatment at a hospital. Gillon spoke at Friday's demonstration, and called for the establishment of a state commission of inquiry into the submarine affair. "I have a very serious concern that the justice system is doing everything it can to bury this story," he said. Another anti-Netanyahu demonstration is set to take place Saturday, in which protesters had planned to march from Jerusalem's Chords Bridge to Balfour Street, but the police refused them permission. Protest organizers predict clashes may erupt with police Saturday, due to the enforcement of noise laws as the High Court determined Thursday. According to the outline presented by the police in a hearing of a petition by residents living near the prime minister's residence against the demonstrations, starting 9:30 P.M. the use of air horns, trumpets and drums will be banned, and from 11 P.M. the use of voice amplifiers will be banned. In an anti-Netanyahu demonstration which took place Thursday, four people were detained for questioning on suspicion of making noise after permitted hours.

News article:
Israeli police said Sunday they had arrested 30 demonstrators after thousands rallied in Jerusalem demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, chanting "Crime Minister" and "You're fired." The demonstrators, some playing musical instruments, gathered in front of the premier's official residence on Saturday night. Local media estimated the crowd at around 10,000. A police statement released early Sunday morning said there were outbreaks of violence during the rally and that officers were hurt. "During the protests, three policemen were injured by protesters," police said. Three of those arrested would appear in court on Sunday, the statement added. Protests demanding that Netanyahu resign over several corruption indictments and his handling of the coronavirus crisis have been mounting in recent weeks, and the premier has been scathing in his counterattack. Earlier this month, Netanyahu accused Channel 12 and another private TV station, Channel 13, of "delivering propaganda for the anarchist left-wing demonstrations" through extensive coverage of the rallies. Israel won praise for its initial response to the coronavirus pandemic, but the government has come under criticism amid a resurgence in cases after restrictions were lifted starting in late April. Netanyahu has acknowledged that the economy was reopened too quickly.

News article:
Protesters and police were gearing up for another night of demonstrations outside the Jerusalem residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday evening, a week after scuffles broke out at last week’s protest, and some 30 people were arrested amid allegations of incitement and police violence. According to Yishai Hadas, a leader of Crime Minister, one of the main groups leading the weekly mass demonstrations against Netanyahu, the biggest fear going into the protest Saturday is that the violence will escalate and someone will get seriously injured. “We have dozens, maybe hundreds of people who have been lightly injured and… a few cases where it was a little more serious; but up until now, there has not been irreversible harm [done] to anyone,” Hadas told The Times of Israel. He hoped there would not be an “escalation in police violence” on Saturday which would change this situation. Hadas was one of three protest representatives at the Knesset’s Internal Affairs and Environmental Protection Committee hearing on Monday on police violence. The hearing was Hadas’ idea, and featured testimony by both protesters and Jerusalem police chief Doron Yedid. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The hearing was called after public outcry following the events of last Saturday, especially the conduct of Chief Superintendent Niso Guetta. In one widely circulated video, Guetta was seen shoving and hitting one protester and then pushing people to the side as he chased down another demonstrator, whom he hit in the face before pushing him to the ground. Guetta and other officers then dragged the person along the pavement before hauling him off. Other photographs showed him kneeling on a supine protester and pushing his head to the ground with his elbow. Advertisement Guetta claims he was assaulted by the demonstrators and that he did not use excessive force. However, despite an ongoing investigation by the Justice Ministry’s Police Internal Investigations Department, Yedid told lawmakers that Guetta went back to work following a 24-hour suspension, and that he would be present at the Saturday protest. A number of the groups behind the protests said the decision to let Guetta return amid an ongoing investigation was unacceptable. On Tuesday, the Crime Minister group and the Black Flags movement petitioned the High Court of Justice asking that Guetta not be allowed to return to the protests until the investigation into the case was completed by the Justice Ministry’s Police Internal Investigations Department. Amir Haskel, the leader of the Ein Matzav (No Way) group, was present at the Knesset hearing and said he was frustrated by the decision. Haskel added that he was concerned about the effect Guetta’s presence could have on the protests. “Why do you need to insist on bringing back Guetta? This is what will provoke people [on Saturday]. It’s clear to you what will happen when he comes here and people see him. Why do that? It is not smart,” he told The Times Of Israel Advertisement Haskel said he believed the decision stemmed from the police’s desire to publicly display backing for subordinates, but that in his opinion, this “automatic” support was a mistake. On Friday, when asked about why Guetta was being brought back to the protests, police spokesperson Micky Rosenfeld insisted that Guetta returning to duty was according to protocol and that his case “was out of their hands.” No trust Saturday’s protest comes at a time when trust between police and the protesters seems to be at an all-time low. Last Thursday, police raised protesters’ ire when a protest encampment in front of the Prime Minister’s residence was forcibly cleared in preparation for a rally of Netanyahu’s supporters, which ultimately attracted just a few hundred demonstrators. According to Haskel, despite promises, the equipment that was taken by the police has still not been returned. During Monday’s Knesset committee discussion, a suggestion was made that protesters and police sit at a round table and reach an understanding. But Haskel insisted that in order to sit at a round table “there needs to be a minimum amount of trust between the sides.” Crime Minister, which is known for being less willing to work with the police than Haskel’s Ein Matzav, announced this week that it would no longer communicate with the police. Hadas said that his main takeaway from the Knesset committee was that “the Jerusalem police has turned into Netanyahu’s last line of defense.” Several signs decrying the police as “political” and “bad” could be seen interspersed among protesters’ signs during Friday afternoon’s protest in Jerusalem. According to organizers, some 4,000 people attended that demonstration, a large number compared to the typical weekly protest on that day. Advertisement On Wednesday, Deputy State Prosecutor Nurit Litman signed a new policy directive aimed at reducing the number of protesters brought before the courts. The directive calls on police to scale back the number of protesters charged with minor offenses such as participation in illegal gatherings, the Haaretz daily reported. Such a charge would be reserved for more serious incidents, such as using violence while protesting. There are early signs that protesters may be looking to capitalize on this policy directive. One of the protest leaders, Or-ly Barlev, tweeted a message to her followers Saturday afternoon saying that there were plans circulating to sit quietly without making noise after 11:00 p.m, when police usually begin dispersing the protests. The rationale, it seems, is that if protesters merely sit without making noise, the police will have no reason to disperse them. Noise Regulations One of the reasons for the violence at last Saturday’s protests was likely a decision by police to begin enforcing noise regulations, and thus their decision to start clearing the protest earlier than in the past. This new policy came following a Supreme Court decision, after complaints were filed by local neighborhood residents about the protests. Attorney Gonen Ben-Yitzhak, another leader of the Crime Minister group, tweeted a message to his followers ahead of Saturday’s protest calling on them to abide by the regulations to stop making excessive noise with air horns and other equipment from 9:30 p.m. and to stop using speakers at 11:00 p.m. “It is an annoying rule, but that is the ruling and we must respect it,” he wrote. He also reminded protesters that the police are not the target and urged protesters not to “curse them or scream at them.” However, Hadas and Haskel explained that they had limited control over Saturday’s crowds, which have surpassed 15,000 participants in recent weeks. “This protest is completely decentralized,” said Hadas. “This protest is conducted with no management in the field, we do not have a speaker system, we do not have means of control. Advertisement “There are many organizations of people who bring [out] their rage spontaneously and in the way they see fit, and the messages are diverse,” Hadas added. Police have said that any violence on their part was a response to protesters’ actions. Although Times of Israel reporters have not witnessed physical violence by demonstrators at recent protests, there have been curses and angry calls toward the police. On Friday, acting police commissioner Motti Cohen released a statement saying that he was “aware of the conversation” surrounding the Israeli police. “To some of it we must listen deeply, as legitimate criticism; but unfortunately there is also a conversation that is incendiary and destructive, that sometimes even verges on incitement, which must be stopped immediately,” Cohen said. Between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem On Saturday, protesters plan to hold a march from the capital’s Chords Bridge to the Prime Minister’s residence, where they will link up with the rest of the protesters, despite the fact they have not received a permit from the police to move through the city. Last week, despite the ban on marches, an estimated 1,500 walked through the city, and although police attempts to stop the procession led to scuffles and to seven arrests, protesters were eventually allowed to proceed to the area near the Prime Minister’s Residence. Demonstrators are also expected to stand at over 300 bridges across the country as part of the weekly Black Flag protest. During Friday’s protest, Haskel took to the stage and told the crowd about the policing he saw at a protest a day earlier in Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square. “I saw with my own eyes a different [kind of] police. A police that does not trap the protesters in barricades, a police that allows the protesters to march without receiving permission to march [in advance], a police that knows how to solve problems, a police that does not use water cannons, a police that speaks about democracy and a police that protects democracy,” Haskel said. However, police spokesperson Rosenfeld insisted that the differences were simply due to the forces in the two cities dealing with different situations on the ground. “There is no differentiation whatsoever between police in Jerusalem and police in Tel Aviv. The orders are the same orders. The response of the police is to what takes place on the scene, and each scene is different,” Rosenfeld said.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez criticized Democrats leaving marijuana legalization out of the party’s platform as “embarrassing.” The New York Democrat said this week that the Democratic Party is behind the times when it comes to legalizing the drug after the Democratic National Committee delegates voted 105-60 on Monday against its inclusion in the platform. “It’s embarrassing. It’s embarrassing that this is not on the Democratic platform,” Ocasio-Cortez told the News Station, a cannabis industry news website. “The Democratic platform on this issue is more conservative than it was in 2016.” The DNC’s platform does not advocate for legalization but rather decriminalization of the substance, which is already legal for medical use in 33 states and for recreational use in 11 states. Legalization is also supported by some two-thirds of people in the United States. “In this issue, it’s not even about being futuristic or next generation,” she continued. “This is an idea whose time has come.” Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who has been outspoken on marijuana legalization, also commented on the DNC vote. “I’m trying to get my party to move forward. I don’t know why the Democrats are moving backwards,” Gaetz said.

News article:
Sen. Tom Cotton warned that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will be beholden to the most radical wing of his party if elected. “Well, Bernie Sanders just acknowledged the reality. I mean, Joe Biden’s campaign really is a Trojan horse for the far Left, the Democratic Party," Cotton said Monday on Fox News. Cotton, a Republican and a supporter of President Trump, rattled off a list of political platforms and policies proposed by liberal Democrats that Biden will be forced to implement. "Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote his criminal justice platform, which is going to let violent felons out of prison, which is going to eliminate the use of bail so violent felons are going to get out ... of jail while they are pending their trial for violent crimes," Cotton said. "But it’s not just that. I mean, look at what Joe Biden himself said on the campaign trail — that Beto O’Rourke is going to run gun control policy, which is going to be gun confiscation. They’re going to give amnesty to millions and millions of illegal immigrants, so they can take your jobs and also get their healthcare funded by you. At the same time, they are going to take away your health insurance on the job." The senator from Arkansas was reacting to comments made by Sanders last month advocating for Biden and celebrating that he would be the "most progressive president since FDR." Cotton said Sanders's comments are evidence of a growing leftward lurch within the Democratic Party that could yield disastrous outcomes for the country if embraced by voters. "They are also going the take radical steps, like turning Washington, D.C., into a state or packing the Supreme Court, to rubber-stamp their left-wing agenda," Cotton said.

News article:
WASHINGTON — The US election plunges deeper into unprecedented territory as challenger Joe Biden announces he will accept his nomination virtually and US President Donald Trump suggests breaking tradition by holding his own ceremony at the White House. Citing coronavirus health risks, the Biden campaign says he will make his speech — the high point of a candidate’s race — from his Delaware home where he has spent most of the last months. He had planned to attend the August 17-20 Democratic convention in Milwaukee, which was already heavily scaled-down from the massive event typical before US elections. But the party says the risk was still too high, and switched to a fully virtual affair. “From the very beginning of this pandemic, we put the health and safety of the American people first,” says Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez. Trump, whose reelection bid is struggling with a badly wounded economy and surging COVID-19 pandemic, signals he may also accept his nomination from home — in his case, the White House. “I love the building. I’m there right now. I spend a lot of time here,” he tells Fox News. Trump’s August 27 acceptance speech was originally planned for North Carolina, but that was scrapped due to the coronavirus, as was the back-up location, leaving the Republican scrambling for alternatives. However, presidents are required to separate their campaigning from taxpayer-funded governing. If he goes ahead, Trump would be breaking at the very least with presidential decorum by turning the South Lawn of the iconic building into his personal campaign stage. Trump defends the idea as “by far the least expensive” and says that logistically it would require far less movement of staff and guests. — AFP

News article:
President Donald Trump yesterday called Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a 'real beauty' who 'knows nothing about the economy'. The president's comments came during a speech in the battleground state of Ohio, where he accused Democrat leaders of 'inflicting a socialist takeover of the US economy known as the horrendous Green New Deal'. The Green New Deal is a proposed plan to tackle climate change, which was initially tabled by Ocasio-Cortez - who minored in economics at college - and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts. Trump said in his speech yesterday: '[The Green New Deal] was conceived by a young woman AOC — AOC plus three, I say — AOC, that's a real beauty, isn't it?' 'She knows as much about the environment — do we have any young children here? — as that young child over there. I think he knows more. And she certainly knows nothing about the economy,' he added. President Donald Trump yesterday called Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a 'real beauty' who 'knows nothing about the economy'. Trump suggested that the proposal, which aims to wean the US off of fossil fuels, could result in the American economy regressing, similarly to Venezuela. 'Venezuela was a very wealthy country 20 years ago — one of the wealthiest per capita, one of the wealthiest, tremendous oil reserves, everything. Now they don't have food. They don't have water. They don't have medicine. They don't have anything. Same thing could happen,' Trump said. Trump went on to criticize the Democrat's stance on fracking, the process of drilling into the earth to release gases to use as energy. 'They want to ban fracking, which will demolish your state. It will demolish Ohio oil and gas jobs. They want to rejoin the disastrous Paris Climate Accord, where you'll pay billions and billions of dollars for the privilege of getting ripped off by other countries,' he said. In this July 23, 2020, file image from video, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., speaks on the House floor on Capitol Hill in Washington Trump lashed out at Ocasio-Cortez during a campaign stop in Texas last week, again criticizing the Green New Deal. In his remarks, made with oil rigs and a giant American flag in the background, Trump warned Texans that Democrats in power would bring Ocasio-Cortez's 'disastrous' Green New Deal, a return to the Paris Climate Accord, and the end of fracking. 'The radical left is fighting to abolish American energy,' he warned. 'If these far left politicians ever get into power they will abolish not only your industry but the economy,' he said.

News article:
Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan praised Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris, even though she has said she will not endorse presidential nominee Joe Biden. "I've fought alongside Senator @KamalaHarris for direct cash payments during the pandemic and for clean water as a human right. Now let's defeat Trump and make those policies a reality," Tlaib wrote on Twitter shortly after Harris was named as Biden's vice presidential candidate. Last month, Tlaib told Newsweek that she wasn't willing to endorse Biden, because she wasn't sure if her constituents would support the nominee. "Residents come up to me and say, 'Rashida, I don't know. I hear Joe Biden this, Joe Biden that.' I say, 'Listen, do we need another four years of Trump? No. Then what I need you to do is go out there and focus on that.' If the ultimate goal is to get rid of Donald Trump, that doesn't have to involve me actually endorsing Biden. My constituents don't need to be bogged down in, 'Is he the best candidate?' That's not what you have to convince my residents. They need to come out in droves and be inspired by something. And that is going to be a vote against Donald Trump," she said. Though she hasn't endorsed Biden, she did promise to deliver her district to the candidate. "When I focus on turnout, we will deliver Michigan to Joe Biden. Trump only won Michigan by 10,000 votes. When I turn out my folks and my district, we'll be able to take back the state. When you focus primarily on getting people out to vote in a district like mine, [Biden] wins," she said. Two hours after Biden picked the California senator, just one other member of The Squad—the group nickname for Tlaib and her fellow Democratic Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota—had publicly commented on Biden's pick via Twitter. On her Twitter, Pressley simply wrote, "That's right. Madame Vice President, Kamala Devi Harris." Ocasio-Cortez and Omar haven't commented yet. Newsweek contacted Ocasio-Cortez's and Omar's offices for comment. Omar may not have commented because Tuesday is the Minnesota Democratic Primary where Omar is fighting for re-election against Antone Melton-Meaux, a well-funded attorney who is running his first race for elected office. All four members of the squad are women of color under the age of 50 who represent the left wing of the Democratic party and are seated in Democratic-leaning congressional districts. While Ocasio-Cortez hasn't publicly commented on Biden picking Harris, on August 6, Harris partnered with Ocasio-Cortez in co-sponsoring a "climate equity" bill that would consider the impact on minority communities in any efforts to build a clean energy economy. Harris also endorsed Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal which stressed a fair and inclusive economy that invests in poorer and overlooked communities. In July 2019, Harris defended The Squad from a racist tweet by Republican President Donald Trump in which Trump told the squad to "go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came." Harris called Trump a "coward" and a "bully" and pledged to send him back to where he came from after defeating him in the upcoming presidential elections. The weekend after Trump's tweet, Democratic strategist Don Calloway speculated that Trump had attacked the congresswomen to prepare for a possible match-up against Harris in the November elections. During the Democratic presidential primary, Ocasio-Cortez initially held off from endorsing Biden for president. After endorsing him, she said it's necessary to challenge Biden to take positions that represent the party's left wing. "The whole process of coming together should be uncomfortable for everyone involved—that's how you know it's working," she said. "And if Biden is only doing things he's comfortable with, then it's not enough."

News article:
Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan praised Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris, even though she has said she will not endorse presidential nominee Joe Biden. "I've fought alongside Senator @KamalaHarris for direct cash payments during the pandemic and for clean water as a human right. Now let's defeat Trump and make those policies a reality," Tlaib wrote on Twitter shortly after Harris was named as Biden's vice presidential candidate. Last month, Tlaib told Newsweek that she wasn't willing to endorse Biden, because she wasn't sure if her constituents would support the nominee. "Residents come up to me and say, 'Rashida, I don't know. I hear Joe Biden this, Joe Biden that.' I say, 'Listen, do we need another four years of Trump? No. Then what I need you to do is go out there and focus on that.' If the ultimate goal is to get rid of Donald Trump, that doesn't have to involve me actually endorsing Biden. My constituents don't need to be bogged down in, 'Is he the best candidate?' That's not what you have to convince my residents. They need to come out in droves and be inspired by something. And that is going to be a vote against Donald Trump," she said. Though she hasn't endorsed Biden, she did promise to deliver her district to the candidate. "When I focus on turnout, we will deliver Michigan to Joe Biden. Trump only won Michigan by 10,000 votes. When I turn out my folks and my district, we'll be able to take back the state. When you focus primarily on getting people out to vote in a district like mine, [Biden] wins," she said. Two hours after Biden picked the California senator, just one other member of The Squad—the group nickname for Tlaib and her fellow Democratic Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota—had publicly commented on Biden's pick via Twitter. On her Twitter, Pressley simply wrote, "That's right. Madame Vice President, Kamala Devi Harris." Ocasio-Cortez and Omar haven't commented yet. Newsweek contacted Ocasio-Cortez's and Omar's offices for comment.

News article:
Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Thursday that he will speak at the Democratic National Convention that kicks off Monday in Wisconsin, which is irritating some of the party’s more progressive voters. Bloomberg, who dropped out of the presidential race in March, was not on the original list released by the DNC Tuesday, but in a tweet Thursday the billionaire announced that he would in fact be giving a speech next week. "This November, America has the opportunity to turn the page on the last four years & invest in our future," Bloomberg tweeted. "That starts at the @DemConvention when we nominate @JoeBiden & @KamalaHarris. I'm honored to be speaking at the DNC next week. I hope you'll join us." DEMS SAY BLOOMBERG NOT HELPING 2020 CAMPAIGN AS MUCH AS PROMISED: REPORT Bloomberg will be joining some of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party giving speeches, including the Obamas, the Clintons, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez D-N.Y., Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt., former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. Bloomberg will reportedly give his speech Thursday, the same night that presidential candidate Joe Biden will give his acceptance speech. A few key figures from the Democratic Party are missing from the night's events, including former National Security Adviser Susan Rice and former congresswoman Stacey Abrams, D-Ga., who were both front runners to join the ticket with Biden as his Vice President. But progressives on Twitter also pointed to a few previous presidential candidates in the Democratic party that were omitted from the list of speakers including Julian Castro, who dropped from the race in January, and Rep. Beto O'Rourke. O'Rourke made a name for himself by narrowly losing to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, during a Senate race in 2018 -- although his presidential campaign was not as successful and he dropped from the race in November 2019. “Legit ridiculous. Especially having someone like Mike Bloomberg who cough cough as a reminder stop & frisked Black and Latino youth in the city of NY for years!” Nelini Stamp, the National Organizing Director for the Working Families Party, said on Twitter Thursday. BIDEN, HARRIS TO DELIVER DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION SPEECHES FROM DELAWARE A former senior adviser to Castro also took to Twitter to voice his dismay of the decision to have Bloomberg address voters from the DNC. “It’s completely unacceptable that there are as many Republicans speaking at the convention as Latinos,” Sawyer Hackett said Thursday. Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang also voiced his disappointment on not being asked to speak. “I’ve got to be honest I kind of expected to speak,” he said earlier this week. Though he announced via Twitter that he was later added to the DNC list of speakers. “And it’s official - we have been added to the DNC Convention speaker lineup! Thank you #YangGang and everyone else who made this happen! CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Several Twitter accounts responded to the tweets protesting the DNC’s choice of Bloomberg over a more progressive Democrat like Castro -- advising against infighting and to focus on getting Trump out of office. Bloomberg is one of the more moderate democrats giving speeches next week, though plenty of more left-leaning political figures will be there like Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

News article:
Bernie Sanders exhibited the progressive wing's support for presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden during a flurry of media appearances on Sunday morning where he voiced his top priority is beating Donald Trump. 'My message to our supporters is we have got to do everything that we can to defeat Donald Trump, who I view as the most dangerous president in American history,' he told CNN's Take Tapper on 'State of the Union.' 'We're going to do all that we can to mobilize people for a progressive agenda,' the Vermont senator continued in his Sunday morning appearance. 'This is not a complicated issue,' the 78-year-old Democratic socialist said of backing the 77-year-old former vice president. 'Donald Trump must be defeated, Biden must be elected.' 'And after that election, we're going to do all that we can to fight for a progressive agenda,' he reiterated. 'What we have to do the day after we elect Joe Biden as president we got to rally our people to stand up and fight for an America that works for all and not just the few,' he added. 'And that absolutely includes Medicare for All.' Sanders is also slated to speak on the kick-off night of the first ever virtual Democratic National Convention on Monday. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders told CNN's Jake Tapper Sunday morning on 'State of the Union' that his top priority is beating Donald Trump in November, claiming the next move would be to fight for a progressive agenda Sanders and fellow progressive Democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are slated to speak at the Democratic National Convention where they will throw the progressive wing support behind Biden's presidency The former 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate will make a speech at the all-virtual event just ahead of headliner speaker and former first lady Michelle Obama. Also representing the progressive wing of the party at the convention this year will be New York City Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has a 60-second speaking slot on the second night of events. On Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez will also share the virtual stage with Biden's wife, Dr. Jill Biden, and former President Bill Clinton. AOC was an organizer from Sanders' campaign in the 2016 presidential race before launching her own political ambitions. As well as speaking to CNN, Sanders – who has gone on quite a media hiatus since suspending his campaign in April and endorsing Biden – also did interviews with NBC News' 'Meet the Press' and ABC News' 'This Week' on Sunday morning to express his support for Biden. The extra push of momentum from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party comes after Biden announced last week that California Senator Kamala Harris would be joining him on his presidential ticket. 'If Wall Street breathes a sigh of relief with Kamala Harris being named to the ticket, what does Bernie Sanders do?' Tapper asked Sanders. 'What Bernie Sanders is going to do is do everything that I can to defeat Donald Trump, to elect Joe Biden,' he responded. This selection marks history as Harris will become the first black woman to ever appear on a major party’s presidential ballot. Harris has also quelled concerns of some far-left factions of the party who were concerned with Biden's middle-of-the-line stance on many policies. Trump has bashed Harris, the former attorney general of California, for her liberal record and claims she is 'nasty' and 'mean' and a 'mad woman.' During an interview with former Fox News commentator Eric Bolling that aired on his show with Sinclair Sunday morning, Trump said she is more liberal than Sanders. The progressive push comes as Biden (left) announced last week his running mate will be California Senator Kamala Harris (right), who last year had the most liberal voting record of any other senator in Congress Trump said Harris is more liberal than Sanders, and asserted Sunday that she would be 'running' the White House as vice president 'She is super liberal,' Trump insisted. 'I have actually heard that she is the most liberal person in Congress. More liberal than Bernie Sanders.' 'Kamala's a socialist,' he continued, claiming she had 'brought over' Biden to the far-left and would be 'running it.' 'She's a disaster,' he asserted. Both Sanders and Harris were once rivals of Biden in the Democratic primary. Harris has the most liberal voting record over the last year of any senator currently serving in Congress, according to GovTrack, a government watchdog. She is a proponent for late-term abortion, has advocated for criminalize climate-change denial and the manufacturing of guns and wants taxpayer-funded health care to apply to illegal immigrants. She has also suggested that being Catholic should disqualify judges from serving on the higher courts. In 2018 she said a Trump nominee and member of the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic organization, might not 'fairly and impartially' judge cases because of the organization's allegiance to the church.

News article:
EXCLUSIVE: The Trump campaign will host a nightly recap of the Democratic National Convention, as part of its rapid response efforts and counter-programming, which they say will highlight the “radical socialism” of the left, Fox News has learned. A Trump campaign official told Fox News on Sunday that the campaign, in response to nightly Democratic Convention programming, will launch “The Real Joe Biden,” a recap of the Democrats’ nightly events. RNC CHAIRWOMAN PREVIEWS DEM CONVENTION WEEK PLANS The rebuttal, which will include panels and commentary from Team Trump, will take place at 11p.m. each night. An official told Fox News that the nightly show will “break down everything Team Trump saw throughout the night.” “The radical, leftist takeover of Joe Biden is complete and Team Trump will be exposing that truth with nightly programming,” Ali Pardo, Deputy Communications Director for the Trump Campaign, told Fox News Sunday.“Democrats won’t be honest about Biden at their convention, so we will be.” Pardo added: “Joe Biden will raise taxes by $4 trillion, give work permits to illegal aliens so they can compete for American jobs, and impose the job-killing Green New Deal on every person in this country.” The first live broadcast will be hosted by senior adviser Mercedes Schlapp and 2020 Strategic Adviser Boris Epshteyn, and will feature guests including GOP National Spokeswoman Liz Harrington, Trump campaign senior adviser Steve Cortes, and President of Citizens United David Bossie. Fox News has also learned that the Trump War Room and rapid response teams will be responding in real time throughout the Democratic Convention. The Trump campaign’s efforts come as they attempt to “outshine” the Democrats during their convention week. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told Fox News Friday that Republicans have a “multi-pronged response.” TRUMP TO CAMPAIGN IN SWING STATES DURING DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION Trump Victory, the joint field effort between the RNC and the Trump Campaign, are planning more than 2,500 events in battleground states across the country next week, including the Trump Victory Leadership Initiative, trainings on voter contact and voter registration, MAGA meet-ups, watch parties and other volunteer events. The president will campaign in key general election battleground states next week, holding events in Minnesota and Wisconsin on Monday and Arizona on Tuesday. While the Trump campaign has not announced the president’s travel for next Thursday, campaign officials confirmed to Fox News that Trump is expected to visit Scranton, Pa. – the city where Biden was born and spent his early years. The trip should come hours before Biden is scheduled to give his presidential nomination acceptance address, which will be the biggest speech of his half-century career in politics. To kick off the DNC’s week, the RNC said they launched TheRealJoe.com, a website designed to “expose Joe Biden’s disastrous record, hypocrisy, and flawed vision for America.” “It’s going to be a big week for Republicans, and we’ll outline the DNC during their convention, just to head into our convention, which will be really exciting,” she said. The Democratic National Committee announced that their convention will be largely virtual, and will be anchored in Milwaukee, from Monday, Aug. 17 through 20. The DNC will bring in four nights of headliners to speak during its two-hour programming window. In addition, each night will showcase a particular theme aimed at highlighting Biden's strengths and Trump's weaknesses. Monday's will be "We the People," Tuesday's will be "Leadership Matters," Wednesday's will be "A More Perfect Union" and Thursday's will be "America's Promise.” The Democratic National Committee has announced that the convention will kick off Monday with speakers including Biden's primary opponents Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, former first lady Michelle Obama and former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a staunch critic of President Trump who ran against him in the 2016 primary race. Former President Bill Clinton, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., former acting attorney general Sally Yates, former secretary of state John Kerry, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama, and other prominent Democrats are expected to headline the convention this week. Meanwhile, the GOP convention is slated to take place from Aug. 24 through Aug. 27. The theme of the convention will be “Honoring the Great American Story."

News article:
This week, Democrats from across the country will come together to formally nominate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for president and vice president of the United States. Progressives, Blue Dogs, moderates, East Coasters, and West Coasters will unite around our shared values and common goal: Extinguish the corrupt, incompetent Trump presidency. The convention offers Americans from all walks of life the opportunity to hear from our party’s leaders. The lineup of speakers includes a wide array of opinions, each offering a unique view on how to solve our country’s most pressing problems. RICHARD FOWLER: BIDEN-HARRIS WILL APPEAL TO EMERGING ELECTORATE, OPENING AMERICAN DREAM TO ALL And while the Republican Party would like to paint this diversity of voices as a weakness, I see it as a strength. The convention gives us an opportunity to come together to build back a better, stronger, fairer America — an America where everyone gets a say in the process. Whether it be creating an economy that works for everyone, or achieving universal, quality affordable health care for all, Democrats are united in the fight for equality, justice and opportunity for everyone, regardless of income, race or religion. Our nation is facing unprecedented challenges, and this year’s convention doesn’t shy away from that. Early on, we took the threat of the coronavirus seriously and thus were able to plan a jam-packed event with speakers from across the ideological spectrum. On their face, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Gov. John Kasich, President Barack Obama, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and U.S. attorney Sally Yates may not seem like a group of people that would come together to support the same platform — but that’s the power of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Biden-Harris is a true unity ticket: Biden started his career post-law school as a public defender; Harris as a prosecutor. Years later in their careers, they would meet as competitors for our party’s nomination. Today, they are the team America needs to solve our most pressing challenges. Joe Biden has served in public life for nearly a half-century. Democrats and Republicans alike know him as an empathic, uniting voice. He’s a decent, steady, seasoned fighter and exactly the leader we need in these uncertain times. This ticket represents the very best of our party. As vice president, Biden fought hard for the Affordable Care Act and knows the difference reliable, affordable health care can make in someone’s life. In the midst of one of the greatest public health crises of our lifetime, this isn’t lost on him. He’s a champion for middle-class workers and served for decades in the Senate, negotiating deals with the Republican Party and pushing hard to make sure working families were heard. The first Black and Indian American woman to represent California in the U.S. Senate, Kamala Harris is a living example of the American Dream and has made a career out of ensuring everyone can achieve it. She fought tirelessly for those who were marginalized or forgotten when she worked in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office. When she went on to become attorney general of California and a U.S. senator, that fighting spirit only grew stronger. Trump’s sexist comments, calling her “mean” and “nasty,” glide right off her back as she sets an example for women and girls everywhere to not allow herself to be defined by weak men. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER This ticket represents the very best of our party. Pragmatic, thoughtful and empathic leaders are what our country is crying out for and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris deliver that 10 times over. Throughout the next week, we’ll hear lots of different ideas about the way this country could be run. It would be disingenuous to say we agree on everything. We don’t. But that’s OK. The range of experiences and ideas that our party brings to the national stage is what makes us so strong. Democrats are working-class Americans, they’re scientists and doctors, they’re frontline workers and teachers, they’re stay-at-home moms and dads, they’re farmers and cattle ranchers, they’re business leaders and media moguls, they’re engineers and librarians, they’re veterans and Gold Star families, they’re you and me and every single one of us gets a seat at the table. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Progress can be incremental. It can be frustrating and daunting and never quite right. But change is all around us. This ticket is a window into what America looks like and also what America could be. An America that is governed by seasoned leaders, by women of color, by those who come from humble beginnings and don’t have Ivy League degrees. An America where everyone gets a chance to make their voice heard, even if not everyone agrees. The week ahead will surely give us a peek at the better days to come, and I look forward to officially nominating Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to build back our nation stronger than ever before.

News article:
This week, Democrats from across the country will come together to formally nominate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for president and vice president of the United States. Progressives, Blue Dogs, moderates, East Coasters, and West Coasters will unite around our shared values and common goal: Extinguish the corrupt, incompetent Trump presidency. The convention offers Americans from all walks of life the opportunity to hear from our party’s leaders. The lineup of speakers includes a wide array of opinions, each offering a unique view on how to solve our country’s most pressing problems. RICHARD FOWLER: BIDEN-HARRIS WILL APPEAL TO EMERGING ELECTORATE, OPENING AMERICAN DREAM TO ALL And while the Republican Party would like to paint this diversity of voices as a weakness, I see it as a strength. The convention gives us an opportunity to come together to build back a better, stronger, fairer America — an America where everyone gets a say in the process. Whether it be creating an economy that works for everyone, or achieving universal, quality affordable health care for all, Democrats are united in the fight for equality, justice and opportunity for everyone, regardless of income, race or religion. Our nation is facing unprecedented challenges, and this year’s convention doesn’t shy away from that. Early on, we took the threat of the coronavirus seriously and thus were able to plan a jam-packed event with speakers from across the ideological spectrum. On their face, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Gov. John Kasich, President Barack Obama, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and U.S. attorney Sally Yates may not seem like a group of people that would come together to support the same platform — but that’s the power of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Biden-Harris is a true unity ticket: Biden started his career post-law school as a public defender; Harris as a prosecutor. Years later in their careers, they would meet as competitors for our party’s nomination. Today, they are the team America needs to solve our most pressing challenges. Joe Biden has served in public life for nearly a half-century. Democrats and Republicans alike know him as an empathic, uniting voice. He’s a decent, steady, seasoned fighter and exactly the leader we need in these uncertain times. This ticket represents the very best of our party. As vice president, Biden fought hard for the Affordable Care Act and knows the difference reliable, affordable health care can make in someone’s life. In the midst of one of the greatest public health crises of our lifetime, this isn’t lost on him. He’s a champion for middle-class workers and served for decades in the Senate, negotiating deals with the Republican Party and pushing hard to make sure working families were heard. The first Black and Indian American woman to represent California in the U.S. Senate, Kamala Harris is a living example of the American Dream and has made a career out of ensuring everyone can achieve it. She fought tirelessly for those who were marginalized or forgotten when she worked in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office. When she went on to become attorney general of California and a U.S. senator, that fighting spirit only grew stronger. Trump’s sexist comments, calling her “mean” and “nasty,” glide right off her back as she sets an example for women and girls everywhere to not allow herself to be defined by weak men. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER This ticket represents the very best of our party. Pragmatic, thoughtful and empathic leaders are what our country is crying out for and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris deliver that 10 times over. Throughout the next week, we’ll hear lots of different ideas about the way this country could be run. It would be disingenuous to say we agree on everything. We don’t. But that’s OK. The range of experiences and ideas that our party brings to the national stage is what makes us so strong. Democrats are working-class Americans, they’re scientists and doctors, they’re frontline workers and teachers, they’re stay-at-home moms and dads, they’re farmers and cattle ranchers, they’re business leaders and media moguls, they’re engineers and librarians, they’re veterans and Gold Star families, they’re you and me and every single one of us gets a seat at the table. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Progress can be incremental. It can be frustrating and daunting and never quite right. But change is all around us. This ticket is a window into what America looks like and also what America could be. An America that is governed by seasoned leaders, by women of color, by those who come from humble beginnings and don’t have Ivy League degrees. An America where everyone gets a chance to make their voice heard, even if not everyone agrees. The week ahead will surely give us a peek at the better days to come, and I look forward to officially nominating Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to build back our nation stronger than ever before.

News article:
“PLEASE NOTE: Since Thomas Lifson posted this piece, YouTube has blocked ALL of the videos to which Lifson provides links below. For the full impact of just how egregious this unconstitutional CENSORSHIP IS, click on the link below and scroll down to see this Democrat sabotage of one of our most prestigious conservative web journals – AMERICAN THINKER!! – Fox News Channel.com probably has a video of Maria’s ‘Sunday Morning Futures’ on its web site, so if you didn’t catch the show yesterday, you may be able to view it there. – CB” With the media and the Democrats completely dedicated to fictional narratives, from Trump calling neo-Nazis “fine people” to the wacky conspiracy theory that Trump is sabotaging the U.S. Postal Service in order to disenfranchise voters, the challenge facing the Trump campaign is letting truth annihilate propaganda. I have long stressed that President Trump understands video narratives better than any other president in American history. He was the most successful reality television producer in the history of the medium, crafting compelling narratives abut job competition that drew record audiences. He understands that in order to reach people effectively, a narrative has to follow a structure similar to that of a play, with three acts. The political narrative of the Trump administration is now entering Act Three, in which the conflicts that developed in the first two acts come to a satisfying conclusion, with surprises sprung and conflicts resolved. We got an excellent preview of the developing messages yesterday, thanks to Maria Bartiromo. If you want to understand the deep currents of American politics, Maria Bartiromo’s weekly show on Fox News Channel, Sunday Morning Futures, is essential viewing. Set your DVR to never miss it if you care about politics. Her guests on yesterday’s edition, embedded in full below, laid out the arguments that the Trump campaign can use to win the race, despite the full force of the media behind the artificial narratives pushed by the Democrats. Each guest capably explained the reality that invalidates the media narratives the American public is marinated in. I am optimistic about the Trump campaign’s ability to push reality into the public consciousness among the persuadable segment of the electorate because the public distrusts the media so deeply and because the truth has a lot of gravity when contrasted with the phony narratives that constitute the Democrats’ public stances. Before I describe what each guest covered and provide the time at which the segment starts so readers can focus on what interests them most, I need to note one bombshell that Maria dropped: her sources tell her that John Brennan is slated for an interview with the Durham investigators on Friday of this week. In federal investigations, a target for indictment is usually called in to speak with prosecutors as the last stage of the investigation, after all the relevant facts have been gathered. The mere fact of being called doesn’t guarantee an indictment, of course. But in practice, in an investigation such as Durham’s, an interview is a necessary but not sufficient precursor of an indictment. Jared Kushner was the first interview, beginning 19 seconds into this video: [YouTube has BLOCKED the video since Lifson posted this article!] Kushner offered a detailed and convincing narrative of the strategy that the Trump administration has used to completely reverse the position of the United States in the Middle East and bring about peace, rather than war, as the trend. Under the Obama administration, Iran was ascendant, and the Arab regimes were turning away from the United States, while Israel faced terrorism from Hezb’allah and Hamas, financed by Iran with the billions handed over to it by Obama’s bribe for the Iran deal. The mainstream media are doing their best to ignore the triumph of the normalization of relations between the United Arab Emirates and Israel. But as Kushner explains very clearly, it is a landmark that is leading to even better things ahead, heading toward real peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors. This is Nobel Peace Prize–worthy. But the Nobel Prize Committee that awarded the Peace Prize to Barack Obama for no accomplishment at all, just for being Obama, is unlikely to recognize this historic major achievement. Kushner strikes me as extremely smart and articulate. Since he was the point man on negotiating with the Arabs and Israelis, it is pretty easy to imagine him selling them on the Trump administration’s vision for the new Middle East. The only reservation I have about the way he presents himself is that there is curious lack of affect. I would call it “poker face-plus,” in the way he speaks in a monotone and shows no facial expression other than deadpan. The one time he gives away his inner thoughts is when he listens to a question and the corners of his mouth show clues about his reaction. I think Jared Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump are likely to be a force in politics for a long time. It is worthwhile watching the interview just to get a sense of how smart and well controlled he is. Maria followed Jared Kushner with an interview with President Trump, mainly on the Democrats’ demands for $25 billion in U.S. Postal Service funding to handle mail-in ballots, and Trump’s opposition. They can’t appropriate the money without a presidential signature, so he holds the power to scuttle their scheme to steal the election with millions of ballots mailed out, stolen, and harvested. Trump is hanging tough. At the end, Trump also makes the case that Russia hoax coup plot was directed by Obama and Biden — another truth bomb that should be a focus of the campaign. Here is where the Trump segment begins: – [ALSO BLOCKED by YouTube] Steve Bannon followed his former boss and explained the big picture of Trump reversing the globalist agenda, which sacrificed American manufacturing, devastating the blue collar middle class, and enriched the top tier of financial and technology elites. Bannon is passionate and articulate. The message he powerfully articulates should win the industrial Midwest for Trump: Here is where Bannon starts:- [ALSO BLOCKED.] Following Bannon is Senator Ron Johnson, who explains how the evidence of the coup has been covered up, but now is breaking out, as long-suppressed evidence finally is coming to light. He speaks with genuine passion and outrage. Given the high probability that indictments will be forthcoming from the Durham (and maybe other) investigators, the members of the electorate who are not already committed to the left have a chance to finally understand “the greatest political crime in American history,”as President Trump described it to Maria. [BLOCKED] The final segment with Steven Schrage on the set-up of spying on Trump campaign, as apparently masterminded by Stefan Halper, Schrage’s PhD thesis supervisor at Cambridge University. Halper has been kept in the shadows, probably because he was a spy for the US who collaborated with Britain’s MI 6 and Christopher Steele, a former MI 6 spy and has been shielded as a “sources and methods” secret that must be protected. The outrageous sums that were paid to Halper for vague “studies” on broad topics looks to me a lot like the American spooks financing the set-up of spying on the Trump campaign by falsely painting Carter Page as a potential Russian agent when, in fact, he was already an asset for the CIA, which was concealed from the FISA Court by former FBI lawyer Eric Clinesmith, who reportedly is pleading guilty and turning state’s evidence in the Durham probe.

Veteran Fox News anchor Chris Wallace praised former first lady Michelle Obama’s virtual speech at the Democratic National Convention late Monday, with the “Fox News Sunday” host stating that she “really flayed, sliced and diced” President Trump. “It was a heck of a contribution,” Wallace said. “She really flayed, sliced and diced Donald Trump, talking about the chaos and confusion and lack of empathy, especially coming from this president and this White House, spoke more about the deficits of Donald Trump than the pluses of Joe Biden, but did talk about especially, not so much policies, but especially his empathy and what he has been through and his care for average Americans.” “This was a very effective speech,” Wallace added.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R). Fox News anchor and host Dana Perino also lauded Obama for her authenticity and ability to connect with voters. “You got the sense when you talk about authenticity, she has it in spades. She has that voice, she has clarity, and she knows what she is out there wanting to do,” Perino, who served as President George W. Bush’s press secretary, said. “She was trying to get everybody to really focus and then she had a call to action: Ask for your ballot tonight.” “I think that the DNC, if they look over the course of the night, the first virtual convention of our history, I think they would say that Michelle Obama stuck the landing,” she added. Democratic convention speakers for Tuesday night include Jill Biden, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and former President Clinton, among others. Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to accept the party’s presidential nomination on Thursday evening.

News article:
In its first online convention, the Democratic Party hopes reweaving the coalition tapestry that helped to have Barack Obama elected twice to the White House will lead Joe Biden to defeat Donald Trump in November. The emphasis on rebuilding a broad coalition of interests, or what Obama supporters called his "big tent", was evident from the outset of the Democratic National Convention on Monday night. Representation for US minorities is threaded throughout planned events at the four-day meeting. Latina activist and actress Eva Longoria hosted the event on Monday. George Floyd’s family will remember the man whose killing by white police officers in Minneapolis triggered massive anti-racism protests across the US. And former Asian-American candidate Andrew Yang will have a prominent spot before Mr Biden, a former vice president, accepts his nomination on Thursday. Other attempts to bring in the left wing of the party included an impassioned plea from Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday for his supporters to avoid a repeat of 2016, where some of them did not turn out for Hillary Clinton. The Co-operative Congressional Election Study, showed 12 per cent of people who voted for Mr Sanders in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries voted for Mr Trump in the general election. On the other side of the political spectrum, Republicans abandoning the Trump ship were represented by former Ohio governor John Kasich and former chief executive of HP and eBay, Meg Whitman. "I am a lifelong Republican but that attachment holds second place to my responsibility to my country,” Mr Kasich said in a speech to delegates on Monday. One expert, however, is questioning Mr Biden’s ability to bring together such a coalition. "It is a strange looking campaign," Joseph Campbell, a professor at American University, told The National. Dr Campbell said a lack of enthusiasm and visibility for Mr Biden were hurdles in restoring the big tent. “Whether that can be accomplished is up in the air,” he said. Mr Biden has opted to run most of his campaign online during the pandemic, drawing contrasts with Mr Trump, who is holding outside rallies and regular press briefings. Dr Campbell compared the Biden campaign to that of Thomas Dewey in 1948, which that was mostly subdued. Dewey lost to Harry Truman that year. But a CNN poll this week gave Mr Biden, for the first time in the campaign, an edge in voter enthusiasm over Mr Trump. Of the 72 per cent of voters who said they are either extremely or very enthusiastic about voting this autumn, Mr Biden took 53 per cent to Trump’s 46 per cent on their intentions. It is a margin that the Democrats are hoping to boost through the convention. Former first lady Michelle Obama’s speech on Monday, despite being prerecorded, urged high turnout in swing states that fell short for Hillary Clinton in 2016. “If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it,” Ms Obama told viewers “We have got to vote like we did in 2008 and 2012. We’ve got to show up with the same level of passion and hope." A Politico-Morning Consult Poll this week showed the Obamas are favoured by 91 per cent of Democrats, so organisers are hoping her message will help to increase voter turnout on November 3. The convention line-up is built around defining Mr Biden and generating enthusiasm for him beyond his being the anti-Trump candidate. On Tuesday, his wife Jill Biden, former president Bill Clinton and New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez will address the convention. Mr Obama, vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton will speak on Wednesday. The last night on Thursday will officially nominate Mr Biden. Dr Campbell warned that no campaign is like another and in a year of a pandemic and social unrest in the US, it is hard to predict the outcome or trust the polls at this point.

One expert, however, is questioning Mr Biden’s ability to bring together such a coalition. "It is a strange looking campaign," Joseph Campbell, a professor at American University, told The National. Dr Campbell said a lack of enthusiasm and visibility for Mr Biden were hurdles in restoring the big tent. “Whether that can be accomplished is up in the air,” he said. Mr Biden has opted to run most of his campaign online during the pandemic, drawing contrasts with Mr Trump, who is holding outside rallies and regular press briefings. Dr Campbell compared the Biden campaign to that of Thomas Dewey in 1948, which that was mostly subdued. Dewey lost to Harry Truman that year. But a CNN poll this week gave Mr Biden, for the first time in the campaign, an edge in voter enthusiasm over Mr Trump. Of the 72 per cent of voters who said they are either extremely or very enthusiastic about voting this autumn, Mr Biden took 53 per cent to Trump’s 46 per cent on their intentions. It is a margin that the Democrats are hoping to boost through the convention. Former first lady Michelle Obama’s speech on Monday, despite being prerecorded, urged high turnout in swing states that fell short for Hillary Clinton in 2016. “If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it,” Ms Obama told viewers “We have got to vote like we did in 2008 and 2012. We’ve got to show up with the same level of passion and hope." A Politico-Morning Consult Poll this week showed the Obamas are favoured by 91 per cent of Democrats, so organisers are hoping her message will help to increase voter turnout on November 3. The convention line-up is built around defining Mr Biden and generating enthusiasm for him beyond his being the anti-Trump candidate. On Tuesday, his wife Jill Biden, former president Bill Clinton and New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez will address the convention. Mr Obama, vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton will speak on Wednesday. The last night on Thursday will officially nominate Mr Biden. Dr Campbell warned that no campaign is like another and in a year of a pandemic and social unrest in the US, it is hard to predict the outcome or trust the polls at this point.

News article:
In its first online convention, the Democratic Party hopes reweaving the coalition tapestry that helped to have Barack Obama elected twice to the White House will lead Joe Biden to defeat Donald Trump in November. The emphasis on rebuilding a broad coalition of interests, or what Obama supporters called his "big tent", was evident from the outset of the Democratic National Convention on Monday night. Representation for US minorities is threaded throughout planned events at the four-day meeting. Latina activist and actress Eva Longoria hosted the event on Monday. George Floyd’s family will remember the man whose killing by white police officers in Minneapolis triggered massive anti-racism protests across the US. And former Asian-American candidate Andrew Yang will have a prominent spot before Mr Biden, a former vice president, accepts his nomination on Thursday. Other attempts to bring in the left wing of the party included an impassioned plea from Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday for his supporters to avoid a repeat of 2016, where some of them did not turn out for Hillary Clinton. The Co-operative Congressional Election Study, showed 12 per cent of people who voted for Mr Sanders in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries voted for Mr Trump in the general election. On the other side of the political spectrum, Republicans abandoning the Trump ship were represented by former Ohio governor John Kasich and former chief executive of HP and eBay, Meg Whitman. "I am a lifelong Republican but that attachment holds second place to my responsibility to my country,” Mr Kasich said in a speech to delegates on Monday.

News article:
On Monday night, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich completed his journey from conservative darling and Republican rising star to speaker at the Democratic National Convention. “I’m a lifelong Republican, but that attachment holds second place to my responsibility to my country,” Kasich said at the event. “That’s why I’ve chosen to appear at this convention. In normal times, something like this would probably never happen, but these are not normal times.” Kasich led a small group of Republican dissidents at the mostly virtual convention’s opening night. But unlike former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, former New York Rep. Susan Molinari, or businesswoman Meg Whitman, Kasich wasn’t identified with the GOP’s centrist wing for most of his career. An anti-abortion budget cutter, Kasich identified with conservatives since winning a seat in the Ohio state Senate at age 26. “John was a conservative early on,” said a former Ohio Republican official. “He was a fighter.” The son of a mailman, Kasich, first elected to represent a central Ohio congressional district in 1982, originally rose to national prominence as a foot soldier in Newt Gingrich’s “Republican Revolution” in the 1990s. With the election of the first House majority in 40 years, at 42, he ascended to the chairmanship of the House Budget Committee, a post from which he crafted blueprints for cutting federal spending, lowering taxes, reforming welfare, and balancing the budget. Most controversially, Kasich sought to reduce the rate of growth of Medicare spending to achieve $270 billion in savings, which Democrats assailed as necessary only to pay for the GOP’s proposed $245 billion tax cut. He also wanted to trim the foreign aid budget 30% across the board, exempting Israel. Republicans were savaged in the press for trying to defund Big Bird via zeroing out federal funds for public broadcasting and cutting the National Endowment for the Arts. Some of these cuts never happened. But by 1997, Kasich was credited with working with then-President Bill Clinton to deliver the first balanced federal budget since 1969. After a decade out of elective office, Kasich was elected governor of Ohio on a balanced-budget platform in 2010, the beginning of the Tea Party era, unseating an incumbent Democrat. In office, he pushed for privatization, championed concealed carry rights for gun owners, supported defunding Planned Parenthood, and signed legislation pro-choice activists blamed for the closure of half of the abortion clinics in Ohio. Like Scott Walker in Wisconsin, he tried to curb collective bargaining by public sector unions. The measure was reversed by voters when labor leaders put it on the ballot as a referendum. After that setback, some allies began to sense a shift in Kasich. Reelected easily in 2014, he fought conservatives in his own party to win approval for expanding Medicaid in Ohio through Obamacare. The New York Times headlined a story about the battle, “Ohio Governor defies GOP with defense of social safety net,” quoting Kasich as saying, “I’m concerned about the fact there seems to be a war on the poor.” The New York Times reported Kasich “occasionally sounds more like an heir to Lyndon B. Johnson than to Ronald Reagan.” “I had a conversation with one of the members of the legislature the other day,” Kasich said in 2013. “I said, ‘I respect the fact that you believe in small government. I do, too. I also know that you’re a person of faith.’” He added: “‘Now, when you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he’s probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small. But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor. You better have a good answer.’” After a 2015 tour promoting a federal balanced budget amendment, Kasich jumped into the Republican presidential race. Like prior John Weaver-advised GOP candidates John McCain in 2000 and Jon Huntsman in 2012, he received favorable press coverage and was competitive in New Hampshire, where he finished a distant second with nearly 16% of the vote, but he couldn’t break through with conservatives nationally. Kasich emerged as a vocal critic of front-runner Donald Trump and, unlike many other candidates, remained one after Trump secured the nomination, refusing to vote for him that November. This time Kasich is actively supporting the Democratic ticket. Though criticized by Never Trumpers in 2016 for not dropping out quickly enough to allow the field to coalesce around a single anti-Trump candidate, he became a spokesman for their concerns about Trump's temperament and fitness for office. “I know that Joe Biden, with his experience and his wisdom and his decency, can bring us together to help us find that better way,” Kasich said Monday night. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was among the liberal Democrats critical of Kasich getting such a large role at their convention, similar to ones played by Democrats Zell Miller and Joe Lieberman at GOP confabs in 2004 and 2008, respectively. Republicans have also panned Kasich’s conversion. “John Kasich’s party and ideology were always selfishly about John Kasich more than the GOP or conservatism,” said Republican strategist Nicholas Everhart. “I think in a lot of ways, it just burns Kasich that Trump was able to take over and mold the party in his own image in a way Kasich had always hoped he’d be able to, but clearly failed.” "After tonight, his future as a Republican is over, and Democrats will have no further use for him," said Bradley Blakeman, a former aide to President George W. Bush. "It was opening and closing night for Kasich’s one act play."

News article:
WASHINGTON — For Democrats, the future will have to wait. A parade of prominent establishment Baby Boomers — and pre-Baby Boomers — reminded voters their set is in firm control of the party as more than a dozen rising stars were crammed into delivering a single quilted speech on the second night of the Democratic convention Tuesday. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., by far the most recognizable young Democrat in the country, was given her own one-minute speaking slot, but only because she was chosen by runner-up Bernie Sanders to act as a "second" for putting his name in nomination. The message the Biden campaign sent to the rest of the country is that now is not the time to test out new leaders or pursue ideological aims. That's consistent with the way Biden ran his primary campaign, claiming the turf of the Obama administration he served in as vice president and challenging competitors — mostly younger and to his left — to define what was wrong with it. He bet that the Democratic electorate, no matter its impulse for fresh blood or progressive policies, would feel more comfortable with a known-commodity nominee who would be hard for President Donald Trump to label as a risky alternative. He won, and now he's presenting himself and his party to Republicans and independents as the safe pick Democrats saw. On the other side, Biden would like persuadable voters to see Trump as a danger both at home — where the coronavirus has claimed more than 170,000 American lives and wreaked havoc on the real economy — and abroad. "With Joe Biden in the White House, you will never doubt that he will stand with our friends and stand up to our adversaries — never the other way around," former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a onetime fixture at Republican conventions, said in endorsing Biden on Tuesday. "He will stand up to our adversaries with strength and experience. They will know he means business." Powell, 83, added bipartisan punch to a program that highlighted remarks from older men of the political establishment, including former Presidents Bill Clinton, 74, and Jimmy Carter, 95, former Secretary of State and 2004 Democratic nominee John Kerry, 76, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, 69. At 59, with no electoral experience, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates stood out for her relative youth and inexperience as she criticized Trump for "relentless attacks on our democratic institutions." They followed a keynote address delivered jointly by 17 next-generation Democrats, including Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Pennsylvania Reps. Brendan Boyle and Conor Lamb, Nevada state Sen. Yvanna Cancela, and Jonathan Nez, president of the Navajo Nation. The format highlighted the idea of a bench of Democrats waiting to take the reins of the party, but also limited the chance that any one of them would become a political liability for Biden. "If this band of 17 radicals is the future of the Democratic Party, Americans should be very worried," the Trump campaign said of the keynoter speakers in an email Tuesday night. "They all hold far-left positions that are well outside the mainstream." But while Biden has said he wants to be a "bridge" from one generation of Democratic leaders to the next, he is signaling that he is in no rush to start paying its construction costs. Download the NBC News app for alerts and all the latest on the Democratic convention. Joseph Mullen, an 18-year-old delegate for Sanders, told The Washington Post's "Power Up" column that younger Democrats have noticed the dominance of the "old guard of Democratic politics" on the first two nights of the convention. "There's not enough young people represented in the lineup," he said. Of course, Wednesday night's program includes Biden's choice for the No. 2 slot on his ticket, California Sen. Kamala Harris, who has been described as a "safe pick" and is also the first woman of color selected as a vice presidential nominee. At 55 and serving in her first term in the Senate, she's less old-guard than many of Tuesday night's speakers. But even Harris, born in October 1964, is a Baby Boomer and, if more progressive than Biden, still solidly within the guardrails of the establishment. For Biden, a young, progressive future is less of a concern than winning now. He has to hope that's true for young progressives, too.

News article:
Former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang accused the Democratic Party of "patronizing" his fellow Americans at times during an interview on Wednesday ahead of his Thursday speech at the Democratic National Convention. “If we're not standing up for the trucker, the waitress or the retail clerk, who are we standing up for?" Yang told The Washington Post. "Democrats have this tendency to have a message out there and then if you don't like the message, it's like, well, it's your fault. …There's this patronizing element to a lot of what we say and do, and it's hurting us, and it's wrong, unproductive, it's a great way to not win." AOC'S IDEA TO SAVE USPS: 'PROGRESSIVE PEN PAL PROGRAM' But Yang did say that some of the party's problems relating to working class voters are mitigated by having former Vice President Joe Biden as the Democrats' presidential nominee. “I think the concern is alleviated in large part by who Joe Biden is," Yang noted. "Joe Biden comes across as the guy he is. He grew up in Scranton and has lived a life that many, many Americans can relate to.” Yang also weighed in on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who nominated Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., during her Tuesday night speech. The populist senator was the running up to Biden in the Democratic nomination race. “She was asked to nominate Bernie, which I thought she did very effectively, but I thought that was a misuse of AOC," Yang told The Washington Post. "She is one of the people who can cut through this medium and deliver a message very powerfully, so I feel like the DNC just missed one on that." Unlike some of his Democratic primary rivals, Yang openly wooed President Trump's supporters and was reluctant to blame the nation's problems on Trump alone. "You are missing the lesson of Donald Trump's victory," he said during a February presidential debate. "Trump is not the cause of all of our problems and we are making a mistake when we act like he is. He is a symptom of a disease that has been building up in our communities for years and decades. And it is our job to get to the harder work of actually curing the disease." CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Yang is scheduled to speak between 9 and 11 p.m. ET on Thursday, during the convention's final night. He was added to the speaker lineup last minute after tweeting about his disappointment at being left out.

Boris Epshteyn, Trump 2020 strategic adviser, called the first two nights of the Democratic National Convention “boring, glitchy” and filled with “no names.” “I thought it was a sad night,” he said Tuesday, on the second night of the Trump campaign’s recap of the convention called “The Real Joe Biden.” “Bill Clinton looked old and terrible…You had Sally Yates who got fired by President Trump for being awful, let’s be honest, and then John Kerry -- they sort of rolled out the losers.” “Are we going to call it the loser night?” Trump campaign senior adviser Mercedes Schlapp joked. Ali Pardo, deputy communications director, added that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez didn’t even mention Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in her one-minute speech in which she symbolically nominated Sen. Bernie Sanders. “They have a real problem with their base, they have a real problem with their party,” she said. BILL CLINTON SKEWERS TRUMP IN CONVENTION ADDRESS: 'THE BUCK NEVER STOPS THERE' “They may not have given her a lot of time tonight, but when you look at the platform, they have given her and her cohorts an enormous amount of influence,” Epshteyn said of AOC's appearance. “It’s very clear they don’t really have a message,” senior adviser Steve Cortes said. “It took the two hours to even mention Joe Biden last night. Tonight was just…boring.” The team also criticized former President Bill Clinton as a speaker Tuesday night, calling him the “poster child” for the #MeToo movement. “Him trying to pretend as though he’s the arbiter of how the office should be treated…the last person in the world I’m taking a lecture from on how the Oval Office should be used is the person who abused the Oval Office in the way he did,” said Hogan Gidley, Trump 2020 national press secretary. Epshteyn criticized what he called “globalism” on display during the foreign policy segment of the convention that included former Secretaries of State John Kerry and Colin Powell. Cortes agreed it was basically a “Reunion of the architects of the Iraq War.” It was like a “bad homecoming party,” Schlapp quipped. “They don’t talk policy. It’s like 'Uncle Joe is a good guy.' That’s just not going to cut it when you’re going to be president of the United States.” Epshteyn said in his experience “the campaign reflects the candidate. So their candidate is diminished, decrepit, messy in a deep, dark basement in Delaware.” A critical point made Tuesday was that the record shows Biden has been unable to make tough decisions, Schlapp said. “He was wrong on Iraq, he was wrong on the Iran nuclear deal, he didn’t want to kill Usama bin Laden…and so they’re just not exposing the truth on Joe Biden’s lack of leadership when it came to tough foreign policy issues," she said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Schlapp added that she was looking forward to hearing “opportunist” Sen. Kamala Harris speak Wednesday. “She’s someone who we need to keep talking about her record," she said. "The most liberal senator in the Senate. She’s the one who keeps cementing this socialist takeover of the left."

News article:
Former President Bill Clinton was once hailed as a rock star at the Democratic National Convention, but amid the #MeToo era, his presence among this year's speakers has created a virtual elephant in the room. Clinton's scathing remarks about President Trump were overshadowed on Tuesday as critics pointed out his past controversies, including his extramarital affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, allegations of sexual misconduct and assault, and his past ties to deceased pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. "Bill Clinton is just a huge unforced error. Totally unnecessary and a very bad look in 2020," CNN host S.E. Cupp tweeted. "Is the ghost of Epstein talking after Bill Clinton?" progressive commentator Kyle Kulinski jokingly asked. CNN PANEL SHUTS DOWN GUEST ASKING HOW BILL CLINTON HASN'T BEEN 'CANCELED' "interesting choice having jeffrey epstein and ghislaine maxwell's friend bill clinton speak at the dnc while the rest of the party is calling trump a rapist," Twitch TV host Hasan Piker similarly tweeted. "Bill Clinton was: • Seen at Epstein’s pedophile island • Flew on Epstein’s plane 25+ times • In photos with Epstein victim • Paid Paula Jones $850,000 for sexual misconduct Bill Clinton is: • Speaking at the Democratic National convention tonight What happened to #MeToo?" filmmaker Robby Starbuck wondered. Journalist Phillip Bailey pointed out how Clinton received "5x" more speaking time than Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who was only allotted 60 seconds on air despite her popularity in the Democrat Party. MSNBC IGNORES EPSTEIN DOCS IMPLICATING BILL CLINTON; CNN LARGELY AVOIDS "For a party that made Brett Kavanaugh’s sexual assault allegations the center of its political universe a few years ago nothing says #metoo like giving @BillClinton such a prominent speaking spot over arguably one of its top 5 women, right?" Bailey tweeted. The Federalist cultural editor Emily Jashinsky reacted to Clinton's criticism against Trump, when the former president said, "At a time like this, the Oval Office should be a command center. Instead, it’s a storm center. There’s only chaos." BRIT HUME: #METOO MOVEMENT IS 'GOING TO BE SUSPENDED' SO CLINTON CAN SPEAK AT DNC "Bill Clinton is lecturing us on what should be happening in the Oval Office," Jashinksy quipped. Even the satirical newspaper The Onion had some fun at the expense of Clinton, running the headline "Cat-Eared, Pink-Haired Bill Clinton Exhorts DNC Viewers To Donate For Access To Uncensored Version Of Speech."

Sen.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to second his nomination and explains how that nomination process works. He adds the DNC should given progressive voices more time to speak. https://t.co/uFiulX7lmj pic.twitter.com/xFeOR83Mej — Washington Post Live (@postlive) August 20, 2020 Sanders comment comes after there was some confusion regarding Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-N.Y) appearance at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday when she formally seconded the presidential nomination of Sanders, the Democratic primary runner-up. Many viewers didn’t realize that the first-term progressive’s endorsement of Sanders was, in fact, standard convention procedure. Candidates who win a minimum number of delegates during the primary like Vermont senator did are given the chance to be recognized. Sanders told the Post that he was the one that invited Ocasio-Cortez to give the brief remarks, not the convention, furthering his point. At the same time, some prominent “Never Trump” Republicans were given speaking slots, including former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, and progressives expressed dissatisfaction that a Republican like Kasich was given more time to speak that a rising star of the Democratic Party like Ocasio-Cortez. Sanders, arguably the leader of the progressive left, spoke at the convention Monday and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) spoke on Wednesday. One notable progressive who was excluded was former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, who criticized the convention for not having more Latino speakers during the four-day event. After initially being left off the speaking slate, entrepreneur and former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang will speak Thursday night.

News article:
The Democratic Party’s 80-page platform on foreign and domestic policy devotes only three paragraphs to Israel, a major U.S. ally. But their inclusion in the official party program received final approval only after an impassioned debate pitting progressives against mainstream Democrats at their national convention, which ended yesterday in Milwaukee. The committee that produced the official draft tried to satisfy both wings, but the staunchly pro-Israel faction, supported by the party’s presidential nominee, Joe Biden, prevailed. Biden rejected two key demands of the progressives, whose left-of-center positions were embraced by Senator Bernie Sanders. His bid for the party’s nomination was handily quashed by Biden, the middle-of-the-road candidate who served as President Barack Obama’s vice-president. The loaded word “occupation,” a reference to Israel’s military rule of the West Bank, was deleted from the platform, in line with a request from moderate Democrats and the conservative-leaning American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). And a proposal to restrict U.S. military aid to Israel in the event of Israel’s annexation of parts of the West Bank was rebuffed. The platform endorsed Israel’s annual $3.5 billion in U.S. assistance. The progressives, however, made some gains. James Zogby, a Democrat and the founder and president of the Arab American Institute, believes the party’s platform this year was friendlier to pro-Palestinian activists than in the past. He described it as a “a major improvement” over previous platforms. For the first time in its history, the Democrats explicitly endorsed Palestinian political rights within the framework of a two-state solution, while reaffirming support for Israel’s security. The Democrats’ plank was supported by J Street, a Jewish lobbying organization to the left of AIPAC, and by a group of 27 dovish former Israeli diplomats and members of parliament who, in a letter on July 25, criticized Israel’s occupation and endorsed the formation of “a sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel with Jerusalem as a shared capital.” Advertisement Democrats expressed opposition to Israel’s expansion of settlements in the West Bank and came out against unilateral annexation, a controversial plan that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended on August 13 so that Israel’s historic agreement to normalize relations with the United Arab Emirates could be advanced. While the platform blasted the Boycott, Divestment and Boycott (BDS) campaign against Israel, it endorsed a new provision supporting “the constitutional right of our citizens to free speech.” In other words, left-wing Democrats are now free to advocate for BDS. In the runup to the convention, progressives succeeded in winning a few victories on the campaign trail. Two of the party’s most visible pro-Palestinian figures, Ilhan Omar (Minnesota) and Rashida Tlaib (Michigan), easily won their primaries.

In the U.S. Senate, 19 Democrats wrote a letter to Netanyahu warning him that annexation of the Jordan Valley would “fray” U.S. ties with Israel. Sanders’ former Jewish outreach advisor, Joel Rubin, said that while the platform contained “strong progressives priorities,” it was generally “very reflective” of Biden’s pro-Israel position. In short, it was strongly supportive of the United States’ strategic alliance with Israel and its commitment to Israel’s security. Biden’s pro-Israel credentials are unassailable, even judging by one small incident. Linda Sarsour, a Palestinian American BDS supporter who has been accused of antisemitism, briefly appeared at a Democratic convention meeting. When the news got out, Biden released a special statement condemning Sarsour. “Joe Biden has been a strong supporter of Israel and a vehement opponent of antisemitism his entire life, and he obviously condemns her views and opposes BDS, as does the Democratic platform,” his spokesman said in no uncertain terms. If elected, Biden and his vice-presidential pick, Kamala Harris, will vigorously support a two-state solution and consistently denounce annexation. In all probability, he will tacitly accept President Donald Trump’s out-of-the-box decisions to move the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Biden will probably chart a new course on Iran. He backed the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, from which President Donald Trump withdrew in 2018 and which Netanyahu lambasted, and continues to believe it was useful in freezing Iran’s nuclear program and preventing a war between Israel and Iran. On his website, Biden contends that the accord successfully prevented Iran from building a nuclear arsenal. He says he would return to the accord while “more effectively pushing back against” Iran’s “destabilizing activities” in the Middle East. Biden maintains good relations with Netanyahu, despite their disagreements on major issues like Iran and Israeli settlements and despite an unpleasant incident that marred one of his last official trips to Israel in 2010. Obama dispatched Biden to Israel a decade ago to break a diplomatic impasse between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority. As Biden visited Yad Vashem to honor the victims of the Holocaust, an Israeli government agency, the district planning commission, announced that 1,600 housing units in East Jerusalem would be constructed in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim as their future capital. The announcement was regarded as a slap in the face by the Obama administration. The then U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, advised Biden to cut short his visit, but Obama decided that he should carry on. Biden soldiered on and retained his cool, but the incident damaged Obama’s relationship with Netanyahu. One can assume that Netanyahu will tread very carefully should Biden succeed Trump, who’s widely regarded as one of the most pro-Israel presidents in history. Under a Biden presidency, Netanyahu would have to shelve annexation indefinitely.

News article:
The Democratic Party’s 80-page platform on foreign and domestic policy devotes only three paragraphs to Israel, a major U.S. ally. But their inclusion in the official party program received final approval only after an impassioned debate pitting progressives against mainstream Democrats at their national convention, which ended yesterday in Milwaukee. The committee that produced the official draft tried to satisfy both wings, but the staunchly pro-Israel faction, supported by the party’s presidential nominee, Joe Biden, prevailed. Biden rejected two key demands of the progressives, whose left-of-center positions were embraced by Senator Bernie Sanders. His bid for the party’s nomination was handily quashed by Biden, the middle-of-the-road candidate who served as President Barack Obama’s vice-president. The loaded word “occupation,” a reference to Israel’s military rule of the West Bank, was deleted from the platform, in line with a request from moderate Democrats and the conservative-leaning American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). And a proposal to restrict U.S. military aid to Israel in the event of Israel’s annexation of parts of the West Bank was rebuffed. The platform endorsed Israel’s annual $3.5 billion in U.S. assistance. The progressives, however, made some gains. James Zogby, a Democrat and the founder and president of the Arab American Institute, believes the party’s platform this year was friendlier to pro-Palestinian activists than in the past. He described it as a “a major improvement” over previous platforms. For the first time in its history, the Democrats explicitly endorsed Palestinian political rights within the framework of a two-state solution, while reaffirming support for Israel’s security. The Democrats’ plank was supported by J Street, a Jewish lobbying organization to the left of AIPAC, and by a group of 27 dovish former Israeli diplomats and members of parliament who, in a letter on July 25, criticized Israel’s occupation and endorsed the formation of “a sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel with Jerusalem as a shared capital.” Advertisement Democrats expressed opposition to Israel’s expansion of settlements in the West Bank and came out against unilateral annexation, a controversial plan that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended on August 13 so that Israel’s historic agreement to normalize relations with the United Arab Emirates could be advanced.

News article:
The Democratic Party’s 80-page platform on foreign and domestic policy devotes only three paragraphs to Israel, a major U.S. ally. But their inclusion in the official party program received final approval only after an impassioned debate pitting progressives against mainstream Democrats at their national convention, which ended yesterday in Milwaukee. The committee that produced the official draft tried to satisfy both wings, but the staunchly pro-Israel faction, supported by the party’s presidential nominee, Joe Biden, prevailed. Biden rejected two key demands of the progressives, whose left-of-center positions were embraced by Senator Bernie Sanders. His bid for the party’s nomination was handily quashed by Biden, the middle-of-the-road candidate who served as President Barack Obama’s vice-president. The loaded word “occupation,” a reference to Israel’s military rule of the West Bank, was deleted from the platform, in line with a request from moderate Democrats and the conservative-leaning American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). And a proposal to restrict U.S. military aid to Israel in the event of Israel’s annexation of parts of the West Bank was rebuffed. The platform endorsed Israel’s annual $3.5 billion in U.S. assistance. The progressives, however, made some gains. James Zogby, a Democrat and the founder and president of the Arab American Institute, believes the party’s platform this year was friendlier to pro-Palestinian activists than in the past. He described it as a “a major improvement” over previous platforms. For the first time in its history, the Democrats explicitly endorsed Palestinian political rights within the framework of a two-state solution, while reaffirming support for Israel’s security. The Democrats’ plank was supported by J Street, a Jewish lobbying organization to the left of AIPAC, and by a group of 27 dovish former Israeli diplomats and members of parliament who, in a letter on July 25, criticized Israel’s occupation and endorsed the formation of “a sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel with Jerusalem as a shared capital.” Advertisement Democrats expressed opposition to Israel’s expansion of settlements in the West Bank and came out against unilateral annexation, a controversial plan that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended on August 13 so that Israel’s historic agreement to normalize relations with the United Arab Emirates could be advanced. While the platform blasted the Boycott, Divestment and Boycott (BDS) campaign against Israel, it endorsed a new provision supporting “the constitutional right of our citizens to free speech.” In other words, left-wing Democrats are now free to advocate for BDS. In the runup to the convention, progressives succeeded in winning a few victories on the campaign trail. Two of the party’s most visible pro-Palestinian figures, Ilhan Omar (Minnesota) and Rashida Tlaib (Michigan), easily won their primaries. Advertisement Jamaal Bowman, a progressive, defeated Eliot Engel (New York), a pro-Israel politician who chaired the House Foreign Affairs Committee, in another primary. In the U.S. Senate, 19 Democrats wrote a letter to Netanyahu warning him that annexation of the Jordan Valley would “fray” U.S. ties with Israel. Sanders’ former Jewish outreach advisor, Joel Rubin, said that while the platform contained “strong progressives priorities,” it was generally “very reflective” of Biden’s pro-Israel position. In short, it was strongly supportive of the United States’ strategic alliance with Israel and its commitment to Israel’s security. Biden’s pro-Israel credentials are unassailable, even judging by one small incident. Linda Sarsour, a Palestinian American BDS supporter who has been accused of antisemitism, briefly appeared at a Democratic convention meeting. When the news got out, Biden released a special statement condemning Sarsour. “Joe Biden has been a strong supporter of Israel and a vehement opponent of antisemitism his entire life, and he obviously condemns her views and opposes BDS, as does the Democratic platform,” his spokesman said in no uncertain terms. If elected, Biden and his vice-presidential pick, Kamala Harris, will vigorously support a two-state solution and consistently denounce annexation. In all probability, he will tacitly accept President Donald Trump’s out-of-the-box decisions to move the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Biden will probably chart a new course on Iran. He backed the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, from which President Donald Trump withdrew in 2018 and which Netanyahu lambasted, and continues to believe it was useful in freezing Iran’s nuclear program and preventing a war between Israel and Iran. On his website, Biden contends that the accord successfully prevented Iran from building a nuclear arsenal. He says he would return to the accord while “more effectively pushing back against” Iran’s “destabilizing activities” in the Middle East. Biden maintains good relations with Netanyahu, despite their disagreements on major issues like Iran and Israeli settlements and despite an unpleasant incident that marred one of his last official trips to Israel in 2010. Obama dispatched Biden to Israel a decade ago to break a diplomatic impasse between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority. As Biden visited Yad Vashem to honor the victims of the Holocaust, an Israeli government agency, the district planning commission, announced that 1,600 housing units in East Jerusalem would be constructed in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim as their future capital. The announcement was regarded as a slap in the face by the Obama administration. The then U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, advised Biden to cut short his visit, but Obama decided that he should carry on. Biden soldiered on and retained his cool, but the incident damaged Obama’s relationship with Netanyahu. One can assume that Netanyahu will tread very carefully should Biden succeed Trump, who’s widely regarded as one of the most pro-Israel presidents in history. Under a Biden presidency, Netanyahu would have to shelve annexation indefinitely.

News article:
Former President Barack Obama argued that it is not strange that Joe Biden has adopted policies further Left than what he ran on in the primary that are closer to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's governing vision. "If you look at Joe Biden’s goals and Bernie Sanders’s goals, they’re not that different, from a forty-thousand-foot level," Obama told the New Yorker in a recent interview that was published Sunday. "They both want to make sure everybody has healthcare. They want to make sure everybody can get a job that pays a living wage. They want to make sure every child gets a good education." Obama suggested that the difference is tactics rather than policy and that the coronavirus pandemic, along with other political changes, has changed more than Biden has. "A lot of times, the issue has to do with ‘How do we go about that, and what are the coalitions we need?'" Obama said. "What I think the moment has done is to change some of those calculations, not because necessarily Joe’s changed but because circumstances have changed." Biden ran on a more centrist platform that rejected his left-wing competitors’ visions of single-payer healthcare and student loan debt forgiveness. Soon after it became clear that he was the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, however, Biden adopted key proposals from the two biggest leftists in the primary field: a proposal from Sanders to make all public higher education free for those with annual family incomes less than $125,000 and a proposal favored by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to reform the bankruptcy system. The Biden campaign worked with aides and allies of Sanders, including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, to form a "Unity Task Force" that created recommendations for the Democratic Party platform. Sanders has said that he thinks Biden could be "the most progressive president since FDR." Despite that left-wing turn, last week's virtual Democratic convention focused heavily on emotion and dislike of President Trump in an effort to court Republicans and centrists rather than highlighting the left wing of the party.

News article:
White nationalist Richard Spencer has said he will be backing Democratic candidate Joe Biden in November's election after previously distancing himself from Donald Trump. Spencer, who was one of the key figureheads of the alt-right movement, tweeted how he is "on Team Joe" on Monday, adding in a self-made campaign slogan, "Liberals are clearly more competent." In a series of tweets, Spencer further explained his reasoning for backing Biden. "The MAGA/Alt-Right moment is over. I made mistakes; Trump is an obvious disaster; but mainly the paradigm contained flaws that we now are able to perceive. And it needs to end," Spencer wrote. "So be patient. We'll have another day in the sun. We need to recover and return in a new form." In another tweet, Spencer added: "I will never flip on my fundamental principles. (My principles were never voting for the supposed 'the lesser or two evils' or 'stopping big government.') "Walking into certain defeat, even death, is not heroic. It's foolhardy. I have no sympathy for martyrs. I admire winners." The Southern Poverty Law Center describes Spencer as "a suit-and-tie version of the white supremacists of old." Spencer first rose to prominence in 2016 after shouting "Hail Trump!" and being greeted with Nazi salutes at an event in Washington shortly after Trump was elected. However, Spencer said earlier this year that he regrets voting for Trump, following the killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani. Spencer feared that Trump's approved airstrike which resulted in the death of Soleimani brought the U.S. to the brink of war with Iran. "I deeply regret voting for and promoting Donald Trump in 2016," Spencer tweeted. "To the people of Iran, there are millions of Americans who do not want war, who do not hate you, and who respect your nation and its history. "After our traitorous elite is brought to justice, we hope to achieve peace, reconciliation, and forgiveness," he added. Spencer also led a protest against the Trump administration launching an airstrike on a Syrian airbase in 2017. Credited with creating the term "alt-right," Spencer was also one of the main organizers of the neo-Nazi "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 at which counter-protester Heather Heyer died after being struck by a car driven by white supremacist James Alex Fields Jr. In a statement released on the third anniversary of the deady rally, Biden said: "Three years ago today, the world watched in horror as neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and far-right extremists with torches in hand descended on Charlottesville, Virginia, spewing the same anti-Semitic bile that was heard in Hitler's Germany in the 1930s. "It was a moment of testing for our country, and a wake-up call to the fact that hate never dies—it only hides. And when our leaders give it oxygen, it can come roaring back to life. "And then our president claimed that there were 'very fine people on both sides.' Donald Trump had the audacity to assign moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those who stood against it. "I knew then that we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. And I knew then that I could not stand by and let Donald Trump destroy the core values of this nation. Now, three years later, we can see even more clearly that everything that has made America, America, is at stake." Spencer and Biden's campaign team have been contacted for comment.

News article:
Sean Parnell is a U.S. Army combat veteran and congressional candidate for Pennsylvania’s 17th district in the upcoming election. He is campaigning on a pro-veteran, pro-military platform. He is expected to deliver a speech on Monday, the first night of the Republican National Convention. In an opinion piece titled “How an Afghanistan veteran went from broken to featured Republican convention speaker” published in the Washington Examiner Friday, Parnell detailed how he failed Ranger School the first time around, was deployed to the Middle East, and was eventually out-processed from the U.S. Army 10 years ago after completing rehabilitation for a traumatic brain injury. SEAN PARNELL ANNOUNCES CONGRESSIONAL RUN ON ‘FOX & FRIENDS’ He said his speech at the RNC will be about “bringing people together. It's about unity. It's about leadership. The theme is that we united on the battlefield in the 3rd Platoon with people from all walks of life in the face of certain death. "One of the most profound leadership lessons that we learned over there was we did not let our differences divide us. We learned very quickly that we all bleed red. If you focus on our differences, we would probably die, so we put that aside. We united as Americans, and we fought on, and because of that, we were victorious," he continued. Parnell is said to be one of President Trump’s favorite candidates in the 2020 race, with the president labeling him an “American hero” on Twitter. Also a New York Times best-selling author, Parnell said Trump famously called him out by name during a speech at the Shale Insights Conference in Pittsburgh, challenging him to run for office. He will oppose Rep. Conor Lamb, who spoke at the Democratic convention last week. Parnell, who is vying for the seat in the suburban western Pennsylvania district beginning six miles outside of Pittsburgh and stretching northwest to Beaver and Butler counties, is also the co-founder of American Warrior Initiative, a veteran advocacy group. RNC SPEAKERS: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT KIM KLACIK In a political ad released in June, Parnell said he is “old enough to remember when the House of Representatives functioned as a legislative body. Not a Trump derangement syndrome support group.” He criticized his opponent, Lamb, for his voting record, including to impeach Trump, against the Born Alive Act, for the Paris Climate Accords, for having an “F” rating from the NRA and for voting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 90% of the time. Parnell said Pelosi fails to represent the people of western Pennsylvania and stays in power because of her “socialism squad in the House,” a reference to freshman Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar. “Conor became Pelosi’s little lamb the moment he got to Washington,” Parnell tells the camera. “Lamb supports Joe Biden who wants to put AOC in charge of Pennsylvania’s energy jobs. That’s like putting Bill Clinton in charge of your intern program.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In the final line of the ad, Parnel concludes: “Let’s send a lion to Congress, and not a lamb.” He is not to be confused with the former Republican Governor of Alaska, also named Sean Parnell.

Also a New York Times best-selling author, Parnell said Trump famously called him out by name during a speech at the Shale Insights Conference in Pittsburgh, challenging him to run for office. He will oppose Rep. Conor Lamb, who spoke at the Democratic convention last week. Parnell, who is vying for the seat in the suburban western Pennsylvania district beginning six miles outside of Pittsburgh and stretching northwest to Beaver and Butler counties, is also the co-founder of American Warrior Initiative, a veteran advocacy group. RNC SPEAKERS: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT KIM KLACIK In a political ad released in June, Parnell said he is “old enough to remember when the House of Representatives functioned as a legislative body. Not a Trump derangement syndrome support group.” He criticized his opponent, Lamb, for his voting record, including to impeach Trump, against the Born Alive Act, for the Paris Climate Accords, for having an “F” rating from the NRA and for voting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 90% of the time. Parnell said Pelosi fails to represent the people of western Pennsylvania and stays in power because of her “socialism squad in the House,” a reference to freshman Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar. “Conor became Pelosi’s little lamb the moment he got to Washington,” Parnell tells the camera. “Lamb supports Joe Biden who wants to put AOC in charge of Pennsylvania’s energy jobs. That’s like putting Bill Clinton in charge of your intern program.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In the final line of the ad, Parnel concludes: “Let’s send a lion to Congress, and not a lamb.” He is not to be confused with the former Republican Governor of Alaska, also named Sean Parnell.

Sean Parnell is a U.S. Army combat veteran and congressional candidate for Pennsylvania’s 17th district in the upcoming election. He is campaigning on a pro-veteran, pro-military platform. He is expected to deliver a speech on Monday, the first night of the Republican National Convention. In an opinion piece titled “How an Afghanistan veteran went from broken to featured Republican convention speaker” published in the Washington Examiner Friday, Parnell detailed how he failed Ranger School the first time around, was deployed to the Middle East, and was eventually out-processed from the U.S. Army 10 years ago after completing rehabilitation for a traumatic brain injury. SEAN PARNELL ANNOUNCES CONGRESSIONAL RUN ON ‘FOX & FRIENDS’ He said his speech at the RNC will be about “bringing people together. It's about unity. It's about leadership. The theme is that we united on the battlefield in the 3rd Platoon with people from all walks of life in the face of certain death. "One of the most profound leadership lessons that we learned over there was we did not let our differences divide us. We learned very quickly that we all bleed red. If you focus on our differences, we would probably die, so we put that aside. We united as Americans, and we fought on, and because of that, we were victorious," he continued.

News article:
The first night of the Republican National Convention received mixed reviews Tuesday from GOP strategists and lawmakers who said they liked that the annual gathering showcased diverse faces in the party but that the tone was too dark to appeal to voters beyond President Trump’s base. During the next three nights of the gathering, these Republicans argued, Trump’s team needs to lay out a vision and specific policy proposals for what the next four years under the incumbent president would look like. But Republicans were quick to point out that Trump and the Republican National Committee did not even publish a policy platform for this year’s convention, which outlines the party’s values. “The lack of a clear platform is disconcerting,” said one GOP lawmaker, who spoke on background to be more candid. “What do Republicans stand for and believe — not just DJT!” The convention is very much a production by and for President Trump, who is slated to speak each of the four nights. All of his adult children are also speaking, as are first lady Melania Trump, who will address the convention on Tuesday night, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr.’s girlfriend. Guilfoyle, a Trump campaign aide, painted a picture Monday night of an American dystopia under Democratic nominee Joe Biden and the Democrats. Liberals, she said, have already turned California “into a land of discarded heroin needles in parks, riots in streets and blackouts in homes.” She neglected to mention she used to be first lady of San Francisco, when her then-husband, Gavin Newsom, was mayor; he’s now governor of the Golden State. GOP strategist Ron Bonjean, a former veteran spokesman on Capitol Hill, said the first night of the Republican convention was much more effective than that of the Democrats’ convention last week which featured speeches by former first lady Michelle Obama, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R). But he said the Trump campaign needs to figure out how to draw a sharper contrast with former Vice President Biden, who’s spent nearly a half-century in Washington, to expand the president’s support beyond just his staunch loyalists. Many Republicans feel it is critical for Trump to turn the presidential election into a choice between himself and Biden and not a referendum on his presidency. Polls show Biden ahead of Trump nationally and in key swing states. Throughout his presidency, “We’ve seen that the Trump base has been largely at 42, 44 percent of approval ratings for the president; he hasn’t moved. So he needs to reach in to that a little bit. There needs to be a little bit more there for President Trump to bring it across the finish line,” Bonjean said during The Hill’s virtual event on the GOP convention. “And by contrasting Joe Biden as somebody that is, you know, that is part of the failed, tired policies that have not solved their country’s problems,” he said, “I think it’s gonna go a long way.” A number of Republicans contacted by The Hill said they had not watched the first night. The convention is being held virtually, so unlike traditional conventions, lawmakers are not arriving together at a gathering. While some wanted to see more emphasis on the administration’s vision for the future, others said the tone struck by former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and daughter of Indian immigrants; and Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.), the sole black GOP senator, delivered a message of hope and highlighted diversity within the party. They’re two areas GOP lawmakers said they feel the party can build upon in the coming days of the virtual gathering. “Tim Scott’s speech was my highlight, speaking from the heart about the opportunity and future for all Americans, Americans of all races and religions. If [Scott] runs in 2024, I will work for him,” Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.), who is retiring at the end of this Congress, told The Hill on Tuesday. Rep. Denver Riggleman (Va.), who lost his GOP primary this year, said he believes that Republicans have a political advantage by holding their convention a week after the Democrats. They can better tailor their strategy after watching the Democratic gathering. The Virginia lawmaker also said he believes embracing positive messaging is the right course of action to energize voters. “Tim and Nikki did a really good job and I think if they build on that type of positivity it’s going to be very difficult for the Democrats. I think there’s an advantage to having a convention afterwards so the Republicans can answer some of the things that the Democrats said last week that I completely disagreed with,” Riggleman said. “It’s good to know what you need to do in the bottom of the inning, right? What you need to do to win and what you need to do to rebut what the Democrats said,” he said. Former Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), who lost his Miami-area swing district in 2018, expressed worried that the GOP was becoming the party of Trump. “That was a bit disconcerting because parties that become only about one person or about the cult of personality, don’t tend to do well in the long term,” Curbelo said during a virtual event with The Hill’s Bob Cusack on Tuesday. Curbelo, who has frequently criticized Trump, said Night One of the GOP convention could be summed up as a juxtaposition between dueling visions of America: one hopeful and diverse, the other doom and gloom. “There were colorful people which, as a person of color, I was very happy to see the diversity that Republicans put on stage,” said Curbelo, who is Cuban American. “However, the messaging was fairly dark, there was a lot of fear. There was a lot of demonizing of the other side, and I am a fan of campaigns and candidates who propose ideas and alternatives and try to inspire people with new solutions. “So give them high marks for the imagery, for the diversity that they put on stage, but unfortunately I think the message, probably left a lot of people wishing for more. What are President Trump’s plans for the next four years?”

News article:
CNN anchor Jake Tapper suggested on Tuesday that Republicans would be "rioting" if Democrats attempted similar "norm-busting" tactics at their own convention. There were plenty of firsts at the Republican National Convention from President Trump's pardon of felon-turned-activist Jon Ponder, his overseeing a naturalization ceremony at the White House, to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's address from Jerusalem. Minutes before the convention began, Tapper slammed the "erosions of norms and standards." "There was an expectation in this country that secretaries of state, a tradition, secretaries of state will not speak at conventions," Tapper told his colleague Wolf Blitzer. "I cannot imagine the outcry if Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had spoken at the Democratic Convention in 2012." CNN'S JOE LOCKHART ATTACKS SANDMANN AS 'SNOT NOSE ENTITLED KID' AFTER NETWORK'S DEFAMATION SUIT He continued, "We're also going to have the president issuing a pardon during a political convention. I mean, the individual no doubt deserves a pardon. He was pardoned earlier this year by the state of Nevada. The idea that this would be done as part of a political convention- it's just a completely norm-eroding, norm-busting tradition. And I think we're going to see a lot of that during this convention. And I just can't even imagine what Republicans on Capitol Hill would be doing if Democrats were doing these types of activities during a convention, Wolf. They'd be rioting, frankly." CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Other CNN personalities were outspoken with condemnation of the RNC. CNN political analyst Joe Lockhart attacked former Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann following the network settling a $250 million defamation lawsuit, calling the Kentucky teen a "snot nose entitled kid" on Twitter. CNN analyst Brian Karem trashed the address given by First Lady Melania Trump, tweeting she "makes me want to vomit."

News article:
With just over two months to go, the presidential election is in full swing. For months, some have claimed Joe Biden will be the winner, just as they did with Hillary Clinton in 2016. With the close of their convention, however, panic among Democrats is spilling out into the open. Let’s recall that heading into the Democrat primary season of 2019, former Vice President Biden was the presumed nominee. Indeed, in May of 2019, a Brookings Institute headline read: “Why is Joe Biden running away with the Democratic presidential nomination?” It didn’t take long after that, however, for Biden to falter. Joe Biden did poorly in the Democrat debates and on the campaign trail and soon Sen. Elizabeth Warren was leading in the polls. She fell and then Democrats looked to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He faltered and then Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., looked like he would take the nomination in February of 2020. LIZ PEEK: TRUMP MAKES RIVETING CASE FOR REELECTION, SHOWS AMERICA WHAT IT IS IN FOR IF BIDEN WINS The Democrats then did something unprecedented. They panicked and brokered the nomination in broad daylight, by convincing candidates to drop out of the race, to stop Bernie Sanders from becoming the nominee. Then they resuscitated Biden’s dying candidacy and made him the party nominee. If we fast forward to today, the Democrats are panicking again, and their panic started right after the end of the Democrat Convention. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The day after, the leaders of the Democrats’ far left base declared the convention did not go far enough to the left. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said “that the target audience for the Democratic National Convention this week was `white moderates’ and that the Democratic Party could have done more to cater to the party’s base.” She also panned potential moderation in spending by Biden advisers. Sanders agreed with her by stating “They should have had more progressives speaking.” Mark those words, if Biden loses this fall, AOC and Bernie will say the party didn’t nominate a true believer and that was the cause of their defeat. Then Hillary Clinton chimed in. During the middle of the Republican Convention, Clinton admonished Biden to “not concede under any circumstances.” A major party leader talking of concession is the diametrically opposite of political confidence. Then it was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s turn to panic. Pelosi, D-Calif., declared, “out of the blue,” that “I don’t think that there should be any debates,” in a clear attempt to protect Biden from losing to President Trump. Keep in mind that presidential debates have become a staple of elections since the 1960s. The great Kennedy-Nixon debate set the standard for how presidential elections have been conducted ever since. So why are the Democrats panicking? Their convention failed to deliver. Indeed, it looks like their convention scared away Independents. In a poll taken by CBS/YouGov, after the Democrat Convention, President Trump raced to a 10% lead among Independents. If Biden takes Pelosi’s advice and ducks the debates with Trump, he will be regarded now, and by history, as gutless. As I have written before for Fox, our parties are so divided, in what I call The Divided Era, that there is little crossover voting between the parties. That dynamic places a premium on major party enthusiasm (another Biden weakness) and how Independents will vote. If a CBS poll gives Trump that big of a lead, even before the Republican Convention started, the Democrat Party leaders have good reason to panic. Biden’s polling troubles don’t end there, however. The latest Rasmussen poll is consistent with the CBS poll. All of that brings us back to Pelosi stating there should be no debates. She is not alone in that thought on her side of the aisle. Many Democrats know that Biden will not fare well in the debates. Indeed, no modern campaign has seen a candidate campaign less or be less accessible than Biden or his campaign. So much so, that that lack of accessibility caused Fox’s Chris Wallace to declare “This is the damnedest thing I’ve ever seen,” and that “I don’t think [Biden] can hide from now until Election Day. I just don’t think it’s possible.” Of course, just over two months ago, Democrat leaders were good with hidin’ Biden. Former DNC Chairman Terry McAuliffe said, at that time, “People say all the time, `Oh, we got to get the vice president out of the basement. He’s fine in the basement.” Now, however, headlines are beginning to read “Biden’s lack of a travel plan worries some Democrats.” If you add it all up, Joe Biden is faltering again. If he takes Pelosi’s advice and ducks the debates with Trump, he will be regarded now, and by history, as gutless. He also would surely lose the election. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If Biden does debate, as he has insisted he will, he is likely to do damage to his prospects as well. Just as Trump looks energetic during the conventions while Biden doesn’t, Trump will look the same in the debates. The plain truth is: Biden has never been a good presidential candidate. He is even worse now. The Democrats revived him once, and their panic now indicates they are trying to find a way to do it again. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM TOM DEL BECCARO

News article:
Progressives are hoping for a big night in Massachusetts as voters head to the polls in the state’s Democratic primaries on Tuesday. Groups like the Sunrise Movement and Our Revolution Massachusetts have gone all-in for progressive insurgent and Holyoke, Mass., Mayor Alex Morse (D), who is taking on House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.). Progressives are also coalescing around incumbent Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), who is facing a high-profile primary challenge from Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.). Additionally, major left-wing figures such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) have waded into the race. The first-term lawmaker recently participated in an ad for Markey, with whom she co-wrote the Green New Deal. And her group Courage to Change has endorsed Morse, who has compared his race to Ocasio-Cortez’s surprise primary win against former Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) in 2018. “That’s exactly what’s playing out here in this district,” Morse told The Hill. “While people are suffering, we have a congressman who’s using his power for corporations and special interests.” The effort from the groups comes nearly two years after Justice Democrats supported then-progressive candidate Ayanna Pressley, who went on to unseat 10-term incumbent Rep. Mike Capuano (D) in Massachusetts. “I’m seeing very similar trends,” said Solomon Steen, an Our Revolution Massachusetts member, who campaigned for Pressley in 2018. “[It’s] just this real phenomenon that I think is getting undercovered in the press of people coming into politics through issue activism. Not just people who have been doing this for years, but a lot more younger people who are very passionate about whatever their issue is, whether it’s environmental justice, whether it’s racial justice.” Progressives are hoping to replicate recent upsets over incumbents in New York and Missouri. In New York, former middle school principal Jamaal Bowman ousted 16-term incumbent Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) in the state’s 16th Congressional District. Meanwhile, in Missouri, registered nurse and activist Cori Bush defeated 10-term Rep. Wm. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) in the state’s 1st Congressional District. Bowman has endorsed Markey and Morse in their primaries, while Bush has put her support behind Markey. Despite the 39-year-old Kennedy’s track record as a member of the House Progressive Caucus, the 74-year-old Markey has been able to harness left-wing support thanks in part to his stance on environmental issues. Markey’s campaign slogan reads, “It’s not your age — it’s the age of your ideas that’s important.” The senator, who is the longest serving member of the Massachusetts congressional delegation, has received endorsements from groups like the Sunrise Movement, Our Revolution and the Working Families Party. “When we’re talking about being a movement candidate, we’re not just talking about someone necessarily [who] was a volunteer and came up through their organization,” said Steen of Our Revolution Massachusetts. “We’re talking about someone who is willing to be the inside voice for these outside groups and enable them to access some of the more arcane and inaccessible elements working within Congress.” Kennedy argued in an interview with The Hill that endorsements from outside groups are not ultimately going to decide the contest that has been playing out across the commonwealth for nearly a year. The congressman also pointed out that a number of the progressive groups endorsing Markey in the primary have endorsed him in prior races. “I don’t think there’s a credible argument that can be made there, whether it’s on strength on the environment or human rights or LGBT rights, or anything else, my record there is a very strong one, and I’m proud of it,” Kennedy said. The RealClearPolitics polling average shows Markey up by 11.2 points. Meanwhile, strategists say that attention from both the media and high-profile progressives in the Senate primary could also help turn out the vote for Morse in his race against Neal. Morse has sought to position himself as a progressive alternative to Neal, telling the left-leaning Jacobin magazine over the weekend that if elected, he would be one of the only Democrats to stand up to the party’s establishment wing. “I would be one of the few Democrats that stands up to the Democratic Party, not just the Republican Party, in fundamentally changing our federal budget to reinvest in people and in domestic priorities like transportation, health care, education, and other social programs,” Morse told the publication. Morse in an interview with The Hill argued that Neal is largely absent from the district, saying, “You would never know that Congressman Neal has power when you look at the district.” Neal’s campaign hit back against the claim, calling it “pure fiction” and citing 700 Neal-hosted events in the district in recent years. All of the candidates competing on Tuesday will also have to contend with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on voter turnout. Tuesday will mark the first statewide vote in Massachusetts to include a vote-by-mail option. Progressive groups on the ground in Massachusetts say they are working with voters to ensure they understand how the mail-in system works, as well as helping them overcome issues in the system. “A lot of people are having to make decisions about can they safely vote in person [while] maintaining socially distant guidelines, and what’s their risk there,” said Steen. The vote-by-mail option could lead to record turnout, with Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin (D) predicting that there could be more than 1.2 million and as much as 1.3 million Democratic ballots cast on Tuesday. Max Greenwood contributed to this report.

News article:
Egypt's PM reiterated that Cairo backs the transitional period in Sudan and supports the aspirations of Sudanese people to achieve prosperity, development and the goals of Sudan's 2018 Revolution During his one-day visit to Khartoum, Egypt's Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly discussed with his Sudanese counterpart Abdalla Hamdok on Saturday several issues of mutual interest, including electrical connectivity, infrastructure, and cooperation in the fields of health, education and trade. A statement by the Egyptian cabinet said that the two prime ministers agreed during the talks on the importance of moving forward in increasing the capacity of the electrical connectivity project between the two countries from 70 megawatts to 300 megawatts. It was agreed upon to abide by the timeframe set by the technicians to finish the necessary equipment for the Sudanese network, which the Egyptian side is working to provide, the statement said. In April, Egypt and Sudan’s electricity grids were officially linked at a voltage of 220 KV, with operations beginning upon Khartoum’s request. At the time, the Egyptian cabinet said work was underway to install necessary equipment at Sudanese plants, which would then be followed with the second phase of the linkage, which would target supplying Sudan with a capacity of up to 300 megawatts instead of the first-phase capacity of 70 megawatts. Saturday's statement by the cabinet said that cooperation in the field of health between the two countries was discussed by the two prime ministers. The Sudanese side expressed appreciation for the good and close cooperation with Egypt, especially with the recent Egyptian assistance to confront the coronavirus pandemic, the cabinet statement noted. In a separate statement by the Egyptian health ministry on Saturday, ministry spokesperson Khaled Megahed said that a shipment of aid was sent on Friday to Sudan under the directives of President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, which included 21 tons of baby formula loaded on two military aircraft. Megahed added that another shipment was sent on Saturday, accompanied by the ministerial delegation headed by Madbouly, which included 1,325 tons of essential children’s medicines as a gift from Egypt to support the health system in Sudan. The spokesperson pointed out that a medical team comprising a number of medical consultants, pharmacists and lab specialists is scheduled to arrive in Sudan next Monday within the framework of El-Sisi's initiative to treat 1 million Africans from hepatitis C. Along with the medical team, Megahed says, Egypt will send two PCR testing devices, a shipment of medicines that are enough to provide hepatitis C treatments to 150,000 people, in addition to 10,000 detectors for the virus. The Egyptian medical team will stay in Khartoum for 15 days to provide diagnostic services and medical treatment for free at five vital medical centres in the Sudanese capital: Ibna Sina Hospital, the Police Medical Complex, Suba Medical Centre, Um Dorman Medical Centre, and El-Aliaa Medical Centre. The Egyptian and Sudanese PMs also renewed their commitment to strengthening trade exchange, the cabinet statement said, and it was agreed upon to develop an action plan to overcome the obstacles that hinder the flow of commercial traffic, especially with regards to transport routes leading to land ports. In this regard, developing cooperation in the field of transport was discussed and it was agreed upon to restructure the Nile Valley Authority for River Navigation, which was established in 1975 as a joint Sudanese-Egyptian commission, so as to raise its competitiveness, develop its fleet, activate the permanent Sudanese-Egyptian joint technical committee, and call for a meeting of the committee in Sudan in the coming days, the cabinet statement said. The two sides also discussed a project to link railways between the two countries in a way that would contribute to opening wider horizons for economic and commercial cooperation. The statement added that Saturday's talks touched upon developing cooperation in the fields of maritime navigation and benefiting from the ports of the two countries on the Red Sea. The two sides also talked about updating the cooperation agreement on land transport signed between the two countries and adding necessary amendments in order to improve services, the statement noted. The two premiers also tackled the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) issue and stressed the necessity of negotiations in order to reach a binding agreement on filling and operating it. Madbouly arrived at the Sudanese capital earlier on Saturday for a one-day visit, where he was accompanied by the ministers of irrigation, electricity, heath, and industry and trade, as well as high-level officials from the transport and education ministries. During a joint press conference, Madbouly reiterated on Saturday Egypt's backing of the transitional period in Sudan and its support for the aspirations of Sudanese people to realise prosperity and development and achieve the goals of the Sudanese Revolution of 2018. Madbouly invited Hamdok to visit Cairo in order to build on the outcomes of today's visit and the Sudanese premier welcomed the invitation and promised to meet it as soon as possible, the statement said.

Egypt's PM reiterated that Cairo backs the transitional period in Sudan and supports the aspirations of Sudanese people to achieve prosperity, development and the goals of Sudan's 2018 Revolution During his one-day visit to Khartoum, Egypt's Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly discussed with his Sudanese counterpart Abdalla Hamdok on Saturday several issues of mutual interest, including electrical connectivity, infrastructure, and cooperation in the fields of health, education and trade. A statement by the Egyptian cabinet said that the two prime ministers agreed during the talks on the importance of moving forward in increasing the capacity of the electrical connectivity project between the two countries from 70 megawatts to 300 megawatts. It was agreed upon to abide by the timeframe set by the technicians to finish the necessary equipment for the Sudanese network, which the Egyptian side is working to provide, the statement said. In April, Egypt and Sudan’s electricity grids were officially linked at a voltage of 220 KV, with operations beginning upon Khartoum’s request. At the time, the Egyptian cabinet said work was underway to install necessary equipment at Sudanese plants, which would then be followed with the second phase of the linkage, which would target supplying Sudan with a capacity of up to 300 megawatts instead of the first-phase capacity of 70 megawatts. Saturday's statement by the cabinet said that cooperation in the field of health between the two countries was discussed by the two prime ministers. The Sudanese side expressed appreciation for the good and close cooperation with Egypt, especially with the recent Egyptian assistance to confront the coronavirus pandemic, the cabinet statement noted. In a separate statement by the Egyptian health ministry on Saturday, ministry spokesperson Khaled Megahed said that a shipment of aid was sent on Friday to Sudan under the directives of President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, which included 21 tons of baby formula loaded on two military aircraft. Megahed added that another shipment was sent on Saturday, accompanied by the ministerial delegation headed by Madbouly, which included 1,325 tons of essential children’s medicines as a gift from Egypt to support the health system in Sudan. The spokesperson pointed out that a medical team comprising a number of medical consultants, pharmacists and lab specialists is scheduled to arrive in Sudan next Monday within the framework of El-Sisi's initiative to treat 1 million Africans from hepatitis C. Along with the medical team, Megahed says, Egypt will send two PCR testing devices, a shipment of medicines that are enough to provide hepatitis C treatments to 150,000 people, in addition to 10,000 detectors for the virus. The Egyptian medical team will stay in Khartoum for 15 days to provide diagnostic services and medical treatment for free at five vital medical centres in the Sudanese capital: Ibna Sina Hospital, the Police Medical Complex, Suba Medical Centre, Um Dorman Medical Centre, and El-Aliaa Medical Centre. The Egyptian and Sudanese PMs also renewed their commitment to strengthening trade exchange, the cabinet statement said, and it was agreed upon to develop an action plan to overcome the obstacles that hinder the flow of commercial traffic, especially with regards to transport routes leading to land ports. In this regard, developing cooperation in the field of transport was discussed and it was agreed upon to restructure the Nile Valley Authority for River Navigation, which was established in 1975 as a joint Sudanese-Egyptian commission, so as to raise its competitiveness, develop its fleet, activate the permanent Sudanese-Egyptian joint technical committee, and call for a meeting of the committee in Sudan in the coming days, the cabinet statement said. The two sides also discussed a project to link railways between the two countries in a way that would contribute to opening wider horizons for economic and commercial cooperation. The statement added that Saturday's talks touched upon developing cooperation in the fields of maritime navigation and benefiting from the ports of the two countries on the Red Sea. The two sides also talked about updating the cooperation agreement on land transport signed between the two countries and adding necessary amendments in order to improve services, the statement noted. The two premiers also tackled the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) issue and stressed the necessity of negotiations in order to reach a binding agreement on filling and operating it. Madbouly arrived at the Sudanese capital earlier on Saturday for a one-day visit, where he was accompanied by the ministers of irrigation, electricity, heath, and industry and trade, as well as high-level officials from the transport and education ministries. During a joint press conference, Madbouly reiterated on Saturday Egypt's backing of the transitional period in Sudan and its support for the aspirations of Sudanese people to realise prosperity and development and achieve the goals of the Sudanese Revolution of 2018. Madbouly invited Hamdok to visit Cairo in order to build on the outcomes of today's visit and the Sudanese premier welcomed the invitation and promised to meet it as soon as possible, the statement said.

The MoU is meant to provide training for students of mechanical engineering, telecommunications engineering, petroleum engineering and pharmacy The Lebanese-Egyptian Business Council and the Beirut Arab University signed on Monday a memorandum of understanding (MoU) providing free Egyptian internships for youth in Lebanese universities, a statement by the university said. The MoU is meant to provide training for students of mechanical engineering, telecommunications engineering, petroleum engineering and pharmacy. Students who undergo this internship program will be given priority to work at Egyptian companies, the statement said. The 45-day program will include a graduation project on an industrial idea that involves Egypt and Lebanon, said Mona Wahba, head of the trade representation office at the Egyptian embassy in Lebanon, according to Egypt’s state news agency MENA. Wahba said this initiative will start with Beirut Arab University and will then be transferred to other Lebanese universities. The initiative will initially include 40 students in the engineering and pharmacy fields and will then secure training in Egyptian hospitals for students at Lebanese medical and nursing colleges. “We view Lebanon as an economic partner with whom we can achieve the model of economic and industrial integration,” Wahba added. The Lebanese-Egyptian Business Council will take care of all expenses of travel, accommodation and training for those involved in the programs, said a statement by the Egyptian embassy in Lebanon. This MoU represents a “glimmer of hope” for Lebanese students and youth amid these hard circumstances, head of the university Amr Al-Adawi said, affirming that a university degree alone is insufficient for youth to be eligible for work after graduation. Egyptian ambassador to Lebanon Yasser Elwi also hailed the initiative, saying it reflects 60 years of Egyptian-Lebanese cooperation and aims to enable Lebanon to “restore the pioneering role that it deserves.” Search Keywords: Short link:

The World Tourism Organisation's (UNWTO) Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said the organisation is willing to cooperate with Egypt to ensure the optimal benefit from Egypt’s tourist destinations. The organisation wants to benefit from the Egyptian model to develop tourism through comprehensive institutional reform, the chief of the UN body told Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi during a meeting in Cairo on Monday. Pololikashvili, chief of the UNWTO, the United Nations agency responsible for promoting tourism, has affirmed the organisation's willingness to foster cooperation with Egypt and to help ensure the optimal use of Egypt’s tourist attractions, the Egyptian presidency stated. Egypt has resumed international flights on 1 July after three months of suspension due to the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, adopting a host of strict preventive measures. Pololikashvili hailed Egypt's efforts to gradually restore foreign tourism. He highlighted Egypt’s "unprecedented support" of the tourism sector -- being a vital pillar of the Egyptian economy -- including the facilities and incentives provided for investors to enable them to deal with the pandemic with the least losses possible. El-Sisi welcomed Pololikashvili's visit, which is his first outside Europe since the spread of the pandemic. The president reviewed with the Georgian chief the strategy Egypt has adopted to revive tourism in accordance with precautionary measures set by the country’s tourism ministry in coordination with the relevant authorities. The Egyptian strategy aims at reviving tourism while ensuring the safety of tourists and workers in the sector, El-Sisi noted. He explained Egypt has taken structural measures to rejuvenate tourism, such as merging the ministries of tourism and antiquities during the latest cabinet reshuffle in late 2019. It also implemented a number of projects in the sector, such as Galala city in the northeastern governorate of Suez, New Alamein city in the northwestern governorate of Matrouh, and the Arts and Culture City in the New Administrative Capital, east Cairo. The projects also include Giza’s Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM), the National Museum of Egyptian Civilisation in Old Cairo’s Fustat, and a “religious” project, named “The Greater Disclosure over the Land of Peace” in the Sinai Peninsula. The president hailed UNWTO’s continuous support of the tourism sector regionally and internationally and its efforts to revive tourism after it was hard-hit by the spread of the coronavirus. El-Sisi and Pololikashvili reviewed a number of prominent projects in Egypt, including various tourism attractions in new urban communities, as well as numerous museums and the project to develop historical Cairo, the Egyptian presidency spokesman said, highlighting the role of these projects in promoting Egypt's cultural and historical heritage. Pololikashvili said he saw some of the mega projects that have been implemented in line with the highest international standards in tourism. The meeting, which was attended by tourism and antiquities minister Khaled El-Anany, was followed by another with Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly. Search Keywords: Short link:

The last time Abe met with Sisi was in August last year on the sidelines of the Seventh Tokyo International Conference on African Development Following Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s recent resignation announcement, Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi issued a statement on Facebook on Saturday praising Abe as a “patriotic statesman who gave much to his country.” Abe, who served for around eight years as Japan’s prime minister and president of the Liberal Democratic Party, announced his resignation on Friday over a resurgence of his ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease from which he has suffered for many years. The Egyptian president wished Abe a speedy recovery and praised him for being “a friend and a supporting partner to Egypt who made great contributions in enhancing cooperation and friendship between Egypt and Japan.” Abe, 65, became Japan’s longest serving prime minister last year, ruling since 2012. This is not the first time Abe has resigned over health issues. In 2007, after only one year in office, he resigned and handed the reigns over to chief cabinet secretary Yasuo Fukuda. The last time Abe met with El-Sisi was in August last year on the sidelines of the Seventh Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD). The two sides discussed enhancing cooperation in the fields of basic education, higher education, culture, technology, energy and transport. They also discussed the construction of the Grand Egyptian Museum in northern Egypt’s Giza governorate, as well as encouraging more Japanese companies to invest in Egypt. Search Keywords: Short link:

Egyptian Deputy Foreign Minister for European Affairs Badr Abdel Aati met with Polish officials in Warsaw on Friday to discuss potential investment opportunities in Egypt for the EU country. Abdel Aati told Polish officials, including the deputy foreign ministry for Africa and the Middle East, that Egypt is keen to enhance cooperation with Poland in several fields, including modern technology, information technology, and artificial intelligence. Egyptian Ambassador to Poland Hossam El-Qawish also attended the meeting, according to a statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry. Abdel Aati affirmed the importance of resuming discussions between the two countries to accomplish a cooperation initiative and to ink an MoU between the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone) and Poland's Katowice Special Economic Zone (KSEZ), with the aim of establishing a Polish industrial zone in Egypt. Egypt has been pushing forward with efforts to attract investors to the Suez Canal Economic Zone in recent years, highlighting the available opportunities for foreign corporations. The Polish zone will provide ways to create investment opportunities for Polish companies in the Egyptian market, as well as tapping into the privileges, guarantees and exemptions the Egyptian government awards to foreign investors, Abdel Aati said. Adel Aati also touched upon the significance of the cooperation between Egypt and the Visegrad Group of countries, which includes Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. He urged the establishment of an industrial zone for the group's countries in the SCZone, as well as in Egypt’s industrial, investment and free zones, in order to consolidate bilateral cooperation. The meeting also covered the latest developments concerning the long-running dispute over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which is being built in Ethiopia on the Blue Nile, as well as updates on the situations in Libya and Syria, and on the Palestinian cause. Issues concerning the eastern Mediterranean, illegal immigration, anti-terrorism mechanisms, and human rights were also discussed during the meeting.

Japan is keen to support Egypt in its green energy agenda, as well as digital transition, which is key to combatting the impacts and spread of coronavirus Egypt’s Ministry of International Cooperation, together with representatives of the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Japanese Embassy in Cairo, organised a virtual high-level policy dialogue to deepen levels of cooperation for 2021/2022, where development projects will be implemented across several sectors including health, agriculture, aviation, electricity, transportation, and the environment, alongside the promotion of knowledge exchange in science and technology. Several representatives of Japanese institutions as well as 41 representatives from a number of Egyptian ministries attended the event. During the meeting, Assistant Minister of International Cooperation for Planning and Strategic Studies Randa Hamzeh, on behalf of the Minister of International Cooperation Rania Al-Mashat, presented the ministry’s principles on economic diplomacy that aim at strengthening "Global Partnerships for Effective Development.” Head of the Asian Cooperation Sector at the Ministry of International Cooperation Mona Ahmed highlighted the support provided by the Japanese government to Egypt amid the Covid-19 pandemic in many development projects across several sectors, the most important of which are energy, transportation, health and education, adding that both countries are looking forward to strengthening cooperation during the coming period in line with efforts to achieve the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. For his part, Economic Adviser to the Japanese Embassy Miyamoto Sokago said that cooperation and strategic partnership between the two countries are expected to experience a new phase, aiming to prioritise and accelerate a clean energy transition for Egypt, as well as contain the impacts of the Covid-19 virus. Head of the JICA office in Cairo Yoshifumi Omura reviewed success stories as a result of joint cooperation between the two countries, saying that all projects aim to focus on three pillars, ‘People at the Core’, ‘Projects in Action’ and ‘Purpose as the Driver’, in order to ensure sustainable development. Japan has invested in 12 projects in Egypt worth $2 billion, including the Egyptian Japanese University of Science, the Abu Rish University Hospital project, the Japanese schools project, and the renewable energy project, which is the first independent power producer project in the country and that aims to contribute to the Egyptian government’s strategy to supply 20 percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2022. To support a post-Covid-19 recovery, Japan’s International Cooperation Agency aims to focus on expanding renewable energy, the maintenance and improvement of the transmission and distribution grid, promoting off-grid power supply, building a hydrogen energy-based society and improving facilities for existing thermal power plants. The agency further aims to push for Egypt’s digital transition through the support and investment of Japanese companies to increase automation and remote work, which is essential in helping to contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus. In regards to health, over $18.5 million in grants were dedicated to support the export of Japanese medical equipment as well as technical assistance to boost Egypt’s health sector and its capacity to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. Japan has been supporting Egypt’s development in various sectors since 1954, with $1.3 billion of aid overall, and $6.8 billion in loans for the energy, health, transport, tourism and education sectors.

Egyptian Minister of Culture Ines Abdel-Dayem has inaugurated a series of seminars dubbed 'Cultural Relations', which aim to strengthen creative cooperation between Egypt and countries around the world, with the first seminar celebrating Mexico's National Day Before the inauguration, Minister of Culture Ines Abdel-Dayem, welcomed Mexican Ambassador to Cairo José Octavio Tripp, Deputy Assistant Foreign Minister for Latin American Affairs Ashraf Mounir, head of the Supreme Council for Culture Hisham Azmy, novelist Mohamed Al-Mansi Qandil and emerging novelist Tarek Imam. The activities of the ‘The Cultural Relations’ seminars, held in cooperation with the Foreign Cultural Relations Sector and the Supreme Council for Culture, started with an evening marking Mexico National Day. “The Cultural Relations seminars have been launched within the framework of ‘Culture Between Your Hands’ initiative to continue the enlightening message of the Egyptian culture ministry,” said Abdel-Dayem, adding that it is a distinct model for partnership and cooperation between the state institutions and the Ministries of Culture and Foreign Affairs. Abdel-Dayem explained that this series aims to consolidate the bonds of friendship between Egypt and the various countries of the world. In addition to shedding light on the activities of creative communication with the nations of the world. Afterwards, she congratulated Ambassador Tripp on the occasion of his country’s national day, handing him a selection of the Ministry of Culture publications – translated to English and Spanish, including The Treasures of Our Museums and The Persian Manuscripts books. On this occasion, ambassador Tripp said, “First of all, many thanks for your kind invitation to take part in this important event, it’s a great privilege to open with Mexico the series of ‘The Cultural Relations’ seminars, and not only to celebrate the independence of my country but its relationship with Egypt too.” “Egypt and Mexico are world powers in cultural terms due to their millennial and prestigious backgrounds, and our status as ‘ancient civilisations’ is a factor of identity and pride in the international arena. We are proud of being Mexicans and Egyptians. As a result, cultural activities have been the main pillars of our bilateral agenda over time. Every year, we see a dynamic interaction between Mexico and Egypt in several and diverse areas of the cultural spectrum. For instance, last year Mexico was the guest of honour of the prestigious Cairo Film Festival, while Egypt was the winner, for the second time in a row, of the Festival of Cultures in Mexico City. During the last three years, the Embassy of Mexico has organised, with the permanent support of the Ministry of Culture, around 30 cultural events in Cairo and Alexandra in areas such as music, dance, photography and cinema. We almost have had one cultural event per month in Egypt and it is amazing, frankly speaking,” Tripp expatiated a little further. He added that this activity clearly shows that Egyptians love culture in all its expressions, and that Cairo is the cultural capital of the Arab World. “And we see a similar phenomenon in Mexico. Until now for instance, the Egyptian Pharaonic Exhibition hosted almost 15 years ago in Mexico City still holds the record for most visitors at the Archaeological Museum of Mexico. Considering this natural attraction, now on we must be more ambitious in order to make possible a formal and systematic interaction between the cultural communities of both countries offering economic opportunities for artists and creators from Mexico and Egypt. Cinematographic, musical and dance expressions have the quality, appeal and potential to succeed in both countries,” Tripp said. “I am sure that Egypt and Mexico have the cultural power to innovate in this aspect in order to make culture the main engine of the bilateral agenda, not only in cultural terms but economically as well.” Search Keywords: Short link:

For instance, last year Mexico was the guest of honour of the prestigious Cairo Film Festival, while Egypt was the winner, for the second time in a row, of the Festival of Cultures in Mexico City. During the last three years, the Embassy of Mexico has organised, with the permanent support of the Ministry of Culture, around 30 cultural events in Cairo and Alexandra in areas such as music, dance, photography and cinema. We almost have had one cultural event per month in Egypt and it is amazing, frankly speaking,” Tripp expatiated a little further. He added that this activity clearly shows that Egyptians love culture in all its expressions, and that Cairo is the cultural capital of the Arab World. “And we see a similar phenomenon in Mexico. Until now for instance, the Egyptian Pharaonic Exhibition hosted almost 15 years ago in Mexico City still holds the record for most visitors at the Archaeological Museum of Mexico. Considering this natural attraction, now on we must be more ambitious in order to make possible a formal and systematic interaction between the cultural communities of both countries offering economic opportunities for artists and creators from Mexico and Egypt. Cinematographic, musical and dance expressions have the quality, appeal and potential to succeed in both countries,” Tripp said. “I am sure that Egypt and Mexico have the cultural power to innovate in this aspect in order to make culture the main engine of the bilateral agenda, not only in cultural terms but economically as well.” Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Official international data reveals that Israel is the world's leading country with regards to the spread of the coronavirus, which is proliferating significantly in certain neighbourhoods in Jerusalem. The weekly report from the US Johns Hopkins University on the spread of the coronavirus pandemic ranked Israel the first in the world in terms of the number of new people infected with the virus when compared to the country's population. The new infection rate in Israel reached 199.3 per million citizens every day last week. Coronavirus infections recorded unprecedented results so far, as 3,074 cases were detected in one day, including 700 among Palestinian Arab citizens alone, out of 33,000 tests carried out today. Thus, the infection rate among those who underwent a test is 9.4 per cent, which may be considered as peak levels. The Israeli Ministerial Committee in charge of coronavirus affairs decided to impose a complete closure as of Monday on around thirty towns classified as "red" due to the high number of cases. This comes in the wake of recording the highest rate of infections since the announcement of the outbreak of the virus in the country last March. In fact, the official report published by the Israeli Ministry of Health revealed today a new record number of daily infections, totalling 3,150 cases. The committee stated that the restrictions imposed on cities classified as "red" are as follows: closing the educational institutions, closing the commercial enterprises apart from essential places such as clinics, pharmacies and bakeries, restrictions on the movement of citizens besides the restriction of movement at a distance of 500 metres from the place of residence in areas that are largely affected by the pandemic. Read: Israel announces partial national lockdown after coronavirus surge Head of the Special Authority to Combat Coronavirus in the Arab Community within the 48 territories Ayman Saif announced: "The ongoing debate within the Ministerial Committee for Coronavirus Affairs is heading towards imposing partial closures and restrictions on the 34 red towns, in addition to imposing a complete closure on four of these towns, including preventing entry and exit." Saif stressed that: "These restrictions and night closures are the result of serious recklessness and failure to adhere to the Ministry of Health's instructions, and therefore they aim to limit the organisation of wedding parties, which are the first source of infection in the red-listed towns." There is currently a state of chaos and turmoil in Israel due to the widespread infection during the second wave of the virus. Ministers of the ultra-Orthodox Jews threaten to withdraw from the government if restrictions are imposed on their people during the Jewish holidays in the middle of this month, due to their cities, in addition to Arab cities, being at the top of the list of red cities. Controversy is growing in Israel over who bears responsibility for the failure and how to deal with coronavirus through complete closure or selective localisation, amid accusations against the police for failure to implement the instructions. The organisation of weddings and large meetings is considered to be one of the causes of the outbreak of the pandemic. This instability runs concurrently in the midst of a stifling economic crisis, manifested by a million unemployed persons in Israel. Social media forums witnessed widespread criticism for the revival of weddings and the participation of a number of heads of local governments, stating that this gives a bad example to the rest of the Arab public.

A prominent Kentucky infectious disease specialist who was hailed by the governor as a “front line hero” has died after a nearly four-month battle against COVID-19. Dr. Rebecca Shadowen, who tested positive for the virus on May 13, died on Friday night, Med Center Health in Bowling Green says. Gov. Andy Beshear tweeted Saturday that he was “heartbroken” to hear of her death and urged people to follow her advice and “wear a mask in her honor.” Connie Smith, president and CEO of Med Center Health, said Shadowen “will forever be remembered as a nationally recognized expert who provided the very best care for our patients and community. She was a dear friend to many.” Before contracting the virus, Shadowen led Med Center Health’s work in National Institute of Health trials of patients’ treatment for the virus, according to media reports. Shadowen had said she believed she contracted the virus after an elderly family member received care at home from an infected caregiver. “COVID-19 does not discriminate in its ability to penetrate our homes and communities,” Shadowen said when announcing in the spring that she had tested positive for the virus. While battling the virus, she surprised members of the Bowling Green–Warren County Coronavirus Workgroup by joining in a conference call, telling the group: “It’s a great day to be alive.” She stressed the importance of wearing a mask in public. In his social media tribute Saturday, Beshear referred to Shadowen as a “front line hero who worked tirelessly to protect the lives of others.” — AP

News article:
The number of daily coronavirus infections around the world reached a record high, eight months after the globe first learned about the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 307,930 new cases Sunday, the highest daily figure in its database. In addition, the group expects a rise in the daily number of deaths in October and November in European countries. Cases in Europe have risen sharply in recent weeks, especially in Spain and France. More than 51,000 new cases were reported on Friday alone in the 55 countries monitored by WHO Europe, which is more than the highest peak in April, according to the head of that branch. Britain, Austria and the Czech Republic were among the countries reporting surges, with new cases in the U.K. reaching more than 3,000 in 24 hours for the second day in a row on Saturday. Berlin’s top health official has expressed concern about the rising number of coronavirus infections in Germany, particularly among young people. Dilek Kalayci told public broadcaster RBB that experience showed young people could easily become “super spreaders” resulting in older, more vulnerable people becoming sick with COVID-19 too. Germany's disease control center on Monday reported 927 new cases across the country in the past day. "It's going to get tougher. In October, November, we are going to see more mortality," WHO Europe Director Hans Kluge said. Even though the continent is experiencing a surge of cases, the number of deaths has remained relatively stable. The resurgence, however, is expected to lead to an increase in daily fatalities, the WHO said. "It's a moment where countries don't want to hear this bad news, and I understand," Kluge said, stressing that he wanted to send the "positive message" that the pandemic "is going to finish, at one moment or another." More than 28.9 million people around the world have been diagnosed with the coronavirus and more than 922,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. has the most deaths with 193,705, followed by Brazil, India and Mexico. India continues to report the most daily new infections of the coronavirus in the world and its daily COVID-19 deaths to remain above 1,000. India’s Health Ministry reported a single-day spike of 92,071 confirmed coronavirus cases Monday and another 1,136 fatalities. The nation has now reported more than 4.8 million infections and more than 79,700 deaths since the pandemic began. In other parts of the world, Israel announced a three-week nationwide lockdown in a bid to quell soaring coronavirus cases, which have passed 4,000 per day. The lockdown will begin on Friday, just hours before the start of the Jewish New Year and the High Holidays. Israel has seen a spike in cases over recent weeks that more tempered measures failed to bring down. It now has one of the world’s worst outbreaks, adjusted for population. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu conceded the new lockdown would exact a "difficult price" on Israelis and the economy but that the goal was "to stop the increase” in cases. Israel earned praise earlier this year for its initial handling of the coronavirus domestically, moving quickly to seal the country’s borders and appearing to bring the outbreak under control. It has since been criticized for opening businesses and schools too quickly and allowing the virus to spread once again. Protests against lockdowns Many nations have seen backlash and protests against lockdowns. In Australia on Sunday, police arrested dozens at an anti-lockdown rally in Melbourne after crowds defied stay-at-home orders. That rally followed demonstrations in Germany and Poland on Saturday, which were attended by anti-vaccine campaigners, conspiracy theorists and far-right activists. Such rallies have also been organized frequently in the United States, the hardest-hit nation in the world. President Donald Trump is under pressure over his handling of the outbreak and was slammed for holding big rallies over the weekend, including an indoor event on Sunday.

The Health Ministry said Thursday morning that 6,808 new virus cases were diagnosed a day earlier, after ministers agreed in a late-night vote to drastically tighten the national lockdown. It was the second day in a row that the number of new cases neared 7,000. The ministry said that a notably high 12.9 percent of the tests that came back Wednesday were positive. There were 54,364 tests carried out. The total number of cases since the start of the pandemic stood at 206,332 with 1,335 deaths. Of the 56,901 active cases, 667 are in serious condition, 164 of them on ventilators, the ministry said. Another 248 are in moderate condition, with the rest displaying mild or no symptoms. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The announcement came after ministers voted to dramatically tighten the country’s existing coronavirus lockdown amid fears that the infection rate is spiraling out of control. Beginning Friday at 2 p.m., nearly all businesses will be closed, with the exception of specific companies and factories designated as “vital” by the Defense Ministry’s National Emergency Authority. The decision, drafted Wednesday by the coronavirus cabinet and approved by the full cabinet on Thursday morning, exempted supermarkets and pharmacies from the closure, and allowed restaurants to work on a home delivery basis only. Yom Kippur prayers that begin Sunday will take place almost entirely outdoors, with groups of up to 10 worshipers permitted to pray inside synagogues, the decision said. The shutdown will also cover the entirety of the Sukkot holiday. Advertisement The holiday season is part of the reason the government was imposing the lockdown now, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday. Since most Israelis in any case don’t work during the holidays, the economic damage of the shutdown would be reduced as fewer workdays will be lost. Nearly all public transportation will be closed, as will the last educational institutions still open — mainly special education programs and private preschools. Israelis won’t be allowed to travel more than a kilometer (0.6 miles) from their homes. Police will be deployed on highways and at the entrances to cities and towns to ensure Israelis don’t attempt to travel during the lockdown. The cabinet decision said officials from the Finance Ministry, Prime Minister’s Office and National Security Council will meet to set ground rules for which government agencies will close, which ones will remain operational, and at what capacities. The cabinet is also reportedly considering closing Ben Gurion Airport to outgoing flights, but the decision was not included in Wednesday’s cabinet vote. The new rules come after a day of acrimonious debates in the cabinet over whether to allow anti-Netanyahu protests during the lockdown, with the Blue and White party insisting a government could not order protests against it to disband. Ministers also argued over how much to restrict prayer gatherings, with Haredi parties Shas and United Torah Judaism pushing to leave synagogues open, even if new limits on numbers of worshipers are imposed. Advertisement Under a final compromise reached late Wednesday, synagogues will close beginning Friday, open in a limited capacity and with worshipers divided into small groups for the 25 hours of the Yom Kippur holiday, then close again on Monday night. A similar compromise was reached on protests, under which demonstrators may gather within a kilometer (0.6 miles) from their homes. In both cases, gatherings may include no more than 20 people at a time who must stay two meters apart. A special compromise was reached allowing for continued protests outside the Prime Minister’s Residence on Balfour Street in Jerusalem, where demonstrators have gathered regularly for months to call for Netanyahu’s resignation.

The Health Ministry said Monday evening that 33 people died from COVID-19 over Yom Kippur, raising the national death toll to 1,499. There were 763 patients in serious condition, with 208 people on ventilators. Additionally there were 287 people in moderate condition. There were 3,426 new coronavirus infections confirmed Sunday, with 25,204 tests carried out. Testing levels, and therefore the number of new cases, were lower due to the eve of Yom Kippur. However, a notably high 14.2% of tests came back positive. Israel had a total of 233,118 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, with 66,639 active cases. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Health Ministry deputy director-general Itamar Grotto told Channel 12 news on Monday evening that he believed that the two weeks remaining in the national lockdown would not be enough to lower the numbers of patients to a manageable level, and that it would need to be extended. “I believe that if we take the right steps in the health system and the public keeps to the regulations, wears masks and maintains social distancing, working together we could be [where we need to be with infections levels] in a month,” Grotto said. The health official was responding to a report that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believed the national lockdown would need to be extended. Advertisement The new figures from the Health Ministry and talk of a longer closure came as Haifa’s Rambam Medical Center was forced to call in extra medical staff during Yom Kippur as it struggled to cope with a surge of new patients, the hospital said in a statement on Monday evening. The medical center said that 24 new patients were hospitalized over the course of the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, in the new coronavirus ward opened in the facility’s underground parking lot. The hospital said it was now caring for 78 patients with COVID-19, with 41 of them in critical condition including 16 on ventilators. A new report by a military task force said the number of new confirmed cases per capita in Israel is the highest in the world. However, the country’s testing levels are particularly high, and there are some countries, like Brazil and Mexico, with far higher rates of positive test results. The report also found that the number of patients in serious condition has multiplied by 10 in three months and reflects “an authentic rise in morbidity.” AFP contributed to this report.

News article:
By Aryeh Stern YERUSHALAYIM — The Health Ministry announced on Thursday morning that a record-high nearly 9,000 new coronavirus cases were diagnosed in the last day, as infections continued to climb and worries mounted of hospitals being overwhelmed by the surge. According to the ministry, 8,919 new cases were recorded, raising the number of infections since the pandemic began to 248,133. The figure almost doubled over the past month, when only 116,882 virus carries had been confirmed since the beginning of September. The previous high of 8,385 cases in a single day was notched last Friday, but the last several days saw infection numbers drop to just several thousand as testing levels fell off due to Shabbos and Yom Kippur. The Health Ministry said 65,694 tests were performed Wednesday, which was also a record high. The ministry said 13.6% of tests came back positive. Forty-three deaths had been announced over the previous 24 hours, bringing the toll since the start of the pandemic to 1,571. The number of patients in serious condition stood at 810, with 206 on ventilators. The numbers were slightly lower than on Wednesday, which saw serious cases rise to over 830 for the first time. Officials have warned that hospitals will begin to be overwhelmed once the number of serious patients rises above 800. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu told health officials on Wednesday to prepare a plan for 5,000 seriously ill patients by next week. Heads of internal medicine departments at Israeli medical centers warned Wednesday that overcrowding and staff shortages meant they were having difficulty treating patients suffering from other illnesses.

Thousands of Israelis held protested against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday for the 12th straight week, with anti-corruption demonstrators being joined by business owners raging against the potential damage of a looming country-wide lockdown. Restaurateurs and owners of gyms and event halls were protesting in Jerusalem outside the Prime Minister’s Residence, alongside the crowds insisting the premier must resign over his trial in three criminal cases. Media reports put the crowd size in Jerusalem at around 10,000. The protest ended after midnight as police forcibly cleared out the remaining protesters who refused to leave. Nine people were arrested for disturbing public order or attacking officers, police said. A police spokesperson described the demonstration as “mostly peaceful.” The demonstration began with a march to the prime minister’s official residence in the capital’s Balfour Street from the Chords Bridge at the entrance to the city, as they have done on three previous occasions.

During the march, protesters could be seen waving Israeli flags and chanting “You take from the poor and give to the rich, what a corrupt government!” Sagi Golan, 36, from Sderot, said he was at the rally to protest against a prime minister whose every act is “driven by his desire to escape his legal judgement.” Golan said he has been unemployed for six months and has been a regular at the anti-Netanyahu protests this summer. Advertisement Lawyer Wajdi Haj Yehia, part of a group of protesters from the Arab city of Tayibe, said they had shown up every week to demonstrate “against corruption, against racism and against the policy of this government at whose head stands Benjamin Netanyahu.” “We will come every Saturday until we replace the government. Because it is time to replace this government because democracy here is really in danger…People need to wake up and understand that there is a historic moment here of change,” he said. Saturday’s protest was expected to be the last before new national lockdown measures are enacted next week. It is not yet clear how protests will be treated under the new restrictions, though they could be limited. Saturday is Rosh Hashanah, and demonstrations are not planned, regardless of the closure. While the focus of the demonstration remained opposition to Netanyahu and alleged government corruption, many of the protesters chanted against the planned lockdown. One protester chained himself to a traffic pole in a statement against the planned measures, which are intended to help bring steadily rising coronavirus infection numbers under control. Surrounded by dozens of demonstrators, a woman called out: “Israel, Israel won’t shut down” into a megaphone. Yoav Marks-Hazani, whose wife runs a restaurant in Jaffa, held a sign reading “Thou shalt not close.” Marks-Hazani said it was his second time attending the protests. Advertisement “Our income has dropped around 40 percent due to the crisis… We’re digging into our savings, asking our parents. It’s a mess,” he said. “This lockdown is politically motivated and won’t solve anything. Even if it slows the spread the virus, it won’t stop it.” Others protested what they said was the detachment from the public’s travails shown by the prime minister, who was set to leave for Washington Sunday to celebrate normalization agreements with the UAE and Bahrain as the rest of the country prepared to go under lockdown. The premier’s original plans to take a private jet for him and his family — to protect them from the press and the rest of his entourage — had kicked up enough public anger before the weekend that he shelved the idea on Friday. “Peace with Bahrain and peace with the emirates really doesn’t interest anyone here. We are busy dealing with everyday life and this is what interests us — not all kinds of nonsense outside,” said 62-year-old Jerusalem resident Boaz Tamir. Tamir held up a sign with a picture of a man rummaging through a garbage can and text reading “Peace with Bahrain? Wait, I found schnitzel in the garbage!” Protest organizers at Balfour called for demonstrations at the airport to “detain” Netanyahu’s flight Sunday. Also at the protest was performance artist Ze’ev Engelmayer, who made headlines last week after being arrested for wearing a body suit of a naked female, a character known as “Shoshke.” Others also dressed in mock Shoshke costumes to show support for him. “A lot of people are identifying themselves with me. It is really fun. I feel that I am setting out on a struggle and there are people by my side,” Engelmayer dressed up as Shoshke told The Times of Israel. Police said Engelmayer’s suit, a fixture at protests in past weeks, could be a form of “sexual harassment against the public,” a charge that does not appear to exist in Israeli law books. Advertisement Engelmayer claimed that police had yet to dismiss the case, despite releasing him hours after his arrest. “Our police opened a case for me for something that does not exist in the law. It is absurd. I want them to close it tomorrow. It really makes me mad,” he said. Earlier Saturday, protests were held in major intersections and on highway overpasses across the country, as they have been in previous weeks. In the seaside town of Caesarea, some 500 people joined a weekly anti-Netanyahu protest outside his private home. Police said ahead of the Jerusalem protest that in accordance with court decisions, use of horns, drums and other noise-making instruments would be banned after 9:30 p.m. to minimize disruption to local residents. At 11 p.m. use of loudspeakers and bullhorns would also be restricted. Shortly after midnight, Police began forcible moving protesters out of the street and quickly reopened traffic in the normally crowded intersection. “We won’t disperse until Bibi resigns,” demonstrators chanted as they were dragged out. Advertisement Jerusalem Police Operations Commander Alon Khalfon said the protests were largely peaceful, but some demonstrators “clashed with police” and attacked them. Overall, the protest was “exemplary,” Khalfon said. He blamed violent incidents during the three months of demonstrations on a “handful” of protesters “who come each week.” Demonstrators have held regular protests this summer against Netanyahu in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and other locations across the country, with the main protest site being the Prime Minister’s Residence in the capital. On Friday, thousands of Israelis marched in central Jerusalem and then rallied outside Netanyahu’s residence to protest against the premier over his indictment on corruption charges and handling of the coronavirus pandemic. While the Friday “Kabbalat Shabbat” protests have become a weekly event drawing several thousand people, including young families and children, this week was the first time protesters were permitted by police to march in Jerusalem. The Friday demonstration was attended by a number of high-profile former figures from the military, as well as academia and the arts, among them former IDF chief of staff Dan Halutz, former Mossad chief Tamir Pardo, former Shin Bet head Carmi Gillon and prize-winning biochemist Ruth Arnon. “We will march not far to Democracy Square, formerly known as Paris Square,” Amir Haskel, leader of the Ein Matzav (No Way) group, told The Times of Israel. He was referring to demonstrators’ hanging of a large banner at the square last week, unofficially renaming the site. “We hope that this is another small step towards the end goal, which is a separation from Netanyahu,” Haskel added. He said what made this particular protest unique was the presence of many people “who dedicated many years of their lives to the country” in various fields, who had all gathered together for the sole purpose of ousting Netanyahu. According to event organizers, who handed out bracelets to keep count of attendance, over 6,000 people attended Friday’s protest. “Democracies do not die in one day… we are in the process and it’s time to wake up,” Haskel told the crowd from the center stage to loud cheers. “Israeli democracy is dying and connected to a ventilator.”

Anger over a nearing nationwide lockdown set to go back into effect in the coming days colored protests outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem Saturday. Protesters have been gathering at the capital’s Paris Square outside the residence every week for three months, and while criticism of the government’s coronavirus policy has been always been present, it has mostly been overshadowed by denunciations of alleged corruption and dirty politics. But on Saturday, the lockdown loomed large. “Israel, Israel won’t shut down,” one woman yelled repeatedly into a megaphone, rallying the crowd to chant after her. On Thursday, Netanyahu’s office announced plans to impose a new lockdown, which will go into effect sometime before Rosh Hashanah next week and is expected to last several weeks. Israel’s high infection rate, after appearing to defeat the virus in early May, is seen by many as a symptom of the government’s failed, slapdash attempts at bringing the pandemic under control. Israel is among the only industrialized countries to require a second shutdown, after fully reopening the economy and allowing morbidity rates to skyrocket over the summer. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The new lockdown must still be approved by the full cabinet on Sunday, and several ministers have said they will oppose at least some parts of it. Some business owners, who will be forced to shut down for the second time in a year, have also protested and some threatened to disobey guidelines and open anyway, citing the high financial toll of the measure. “I have friends who have small businesses that have been hurt. People lost their employment,” said lawyer Wajdi Haj Yehia, one of a group of Arab protesters from Tayibe who have attended the protests on a regular basis. Advertisement “Today people are in a financial hardship that is so difficult that no one has asked what the repercussions of it will be financially, socially and mentally. Now they are talking in the government about another lockdown, which is an unnecessary lockdown in my opinion. They [the government] need to sober up and make a proper plan in order to get out of this crisis.” Elsewhere in Paris Square, performance artist Ariel Barnoz chained himself to a traffic pole — while only wearing underwear — in a statement against the planned measures. Firefighters were eventually called in to unshackle him from the pole before police detained him. Several protesters brought up the fact that during the last round of lockdowns, over the spring, several senior government officials, including the prime minister and President Reuven Rivlin, were caught breaking the rules. “I’d follow the restrictions if I saw the government following it, or if I saw the Prime Minster following it,” said Noga, a demonstrator from Tel Aviv. Saturday’s demonstration came a day after Israel announced an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with Bahrain, the second Arab country to normalize ties with Israel in under a month and just the fourth overall. Advertisement But the surprise announcement had little effect on the thousands of demonstrators, who were also incensed by the fact that Netanyahu would be jetting off to Washington for a signing ceremony with the United Arab Emirates as the rest of the country was preparing to be locked down. 56-year-old Noam Bloch from Bat Shlomo held up a plane shaped balloon with pictures of Netanyahu and his wife in protest. He claimed the cost of flying Netanyahu and his family around was “incomprehensible” given “how many people who are unemployed today could live off that.” Protesters said Saturday that they were planning to converge on Ben-Gurion airport on Sunday to stop Netanyahu’s plane. This coming Saturday will be the first in months without a protest, not because of the lockdown, during which protests will be protected, but because of the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah. Protesters insisted they would be back after the holiday. “No lockdown can stop the protests…Every citizen should understand that they have the right to protest and they should not be afraid of anything,” said Sadi Ben-Shitrit, one of the leaders of Crime Minister protest group. “This is an illegitimate government…They are killing our country. We do not interest them…We need to kick them out.” One woman named Maya spent much of the protest dressed as Superwoman, while decrying the government from atop a traffic light. ““We are staying here. We are not moving anywhere, even if there is a lockdown,” said the 22-year-old Jerusalemite. “It is a lockdown that we are unwilling to accept, not now.”

We do not interest them…We need to kick them out.” One woman named Maya spent much of the protest dressed as Superwoman, while decrying the government from atop a traffic light. ““We are staying here. We are not moving anywhere, even if there is a lockdown,” said the 22-year-old Jerusalemite. “It is a lockdown that we are unwilling to accept, not now.”

Anger over a nearing nationwide lockdown set to go back into effect in the coming days colored protests outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem Saturday. Protesters have been gathering at the capital’s Paris Square outside the residence every week for three months, and while criticism of the government’s coronavirus policy has been always been present, it has mostly been overshadowed by denunciations of alleged corruption and dirty politics. But on Saturday, the lockdown loomed large. “Israel, Israel won’t shut down,” one woman yelled repeatedly into a megaphone, rallying the crowd to chant after her. On Thursday, Netanyahu’s office announced plans to impose a new lockdown, which will go into effect sometime before Rosh Hashanah next week and is expected to last several weeks. Israel’s high infection rate, after appearing to defeat the virus in early May, is seen by many as a symptom of the government’s failed, slapdash attempts at bringing the pandemic under control. Israel is among the only industrialized countries to require a second shutdown, after fully reopening the economy and allowing morbidity rates to skyrocket over the summer. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The new lockdown must still be approved by the full cabinet on Sunday, and several ministers have said they will oppose at least some parts of it. Some business owners, who will be forced to shut down for the second time in a year, have also protested and some threatened to disobey guidelines and open anyway, citing the high financial toll of the measure. “I have friends who have small businesses that have been hurt. People lost their employment,” said lawyer Wajdi Haj Yehia, one of a group of Arab protesters from Tayibe who have attended the protests on a regular basis. Advertisement “Today people are in a financial hardship that is so difficult that no one has asked what the repercussions of it will be financially, socially and mentally. Now they are talking in the government about another lockdown, which is an unnecessary lockdown in my opinion. They [the government] need to sober up and make a proper plan in order to get out of this crisis.” Elsewhere in Paris Square, performance artist Ariel Barnoz chained himself to a traffic pole — while only wearing underwear — in a statement against the planned measures. Firefighters were eventually called in to unshackle him from the pole before police detained him. Several protesters brought up the fact that during the last round of lockdowns, over the spring, several senior government officials, including the prime minister and President Reuven Rivlin, were caught breaking the rules. “I’d follow the restrictions if I saw the government following it, or if I saw the Prime Minster following it,” said Noga, a demonstrator from Tel Aviv. Saturday’s demonstration came a day after Israel announced an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with Bahrain, the second Arab country to normalize ties with Israel in under a month and just the fourth overall. Advertisement But the surprise announcement had little effect on the thousands of demonstrators, who were also incensed by the fact that Netanyahu would be jetting off to Washington for a signing ceremony with the United Arab Emirates as the rest of the country was preparing to be locked down. 56-year-old Noam Bloch from Bat Shlomo held up a plane shaped balloon with pictures of Netanyahu and his wife in protest. He claimed the cost of flying Netanyahu and his family around was “incomprehensible” given “how many people who are unemployed today could live off that.” Protesters said Saturday that they were planning to converge on Ben-Gurion airport on Sunday to stop Netanyahu’s plane. This coming Saturday will be the first in months without a protest, not because of the lockdown, during which protests will be protected, but because of the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah. Protesters insisted they would be back after the holiday. “No lockdown can stop the protests…Every citizen should understand that they have the right to protest and they should not be afraid of anything,” said Sadi Ben-Shitrit, one of the leaders of Crime Minister protest group. “This is an illegitimate government…They are killing our country. We do not interest them…We need to kick them out.” One woman named Maya spent much of the protest dressed as Superwoman, while decrying the government from atop a traffic light. ““We are staying here. We are not moving anywhere, even if there is a lockdown,” said the 22-year-old Jerusalemite. “It is a lockdown that we are unwilling to accept, not now.”

Several thousand protesters showed up on Sunday for a weekly anti-Netanyahu demonstration near the prime minister's official residence in Jerusalem, which in its 13th week drew a smaller crowd than usual, as Israel in under a nationwide coronavirus lockdown. His detention was extended by two days.Police said they arrested a driver who was speeding near the main protest site, "putting protesters and police officers in danger." No injuries were reported, and the suspect, a 20-year-old resident of Jerusalem, was taken into questioning. Overall, 11 protesters were arrested or detained Sunday night for disturbance of the peace and assaulting a police officer.

Hunderds of anti-Netanyahu protesters also gathered in Caesarea near the prime minister's private residece. One of them said: "I'm not for defying the lockdown, and I wouldn't have come if it was banned. But as a citizen I feel the need to protest, becuase what's going on here is unbelievable." Also on Sunday, ultra-Orthodox protesters demonstrated in five cities over what organizers call "the lockdown's destructive ramifications, which hurt religious life, and citizens' welfare." They claim the government's restrictions disrupt the marking of the Jewish High Holy Days throughout this month. Several demonstrators in the predominantly ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak torched garbage bins and hurled stones at police officers. The police said that a patrol vehicle was damaged, adding that one person was arrested. Protests are allowed during the three-week lockdown, but under restrictions released on Friday – the same day the lockdown began – demonstrators must stay within separated groups of up to 20 people.

Credit: Tomer Appelbaum Police have set up barriers at the main protest site in Jerusalem, but most protesters have ignored them, and police officials said they wouldn't enforce the new directives, which have not yet gone into effect. As the crowds gathered, one activist was detained after police said he told protesters how to avoid being fined for not wearing a protective mask. A senior police official told Haaretz that the police are aware that these planned protests may be used as a tactic to evade movement restrictions, because the police "cannot enforce regulations fully and if someone says they are on their way to a protest, they can't be fined." "We know that some intend to take advantage of these protests in order to allow families that spent the holiday outside their home, at relatives' or with their rabbis to return home and tell officers at roadblocks that they're on their way to a protest," said the official. The wave of anti-Netanyahu protests in Jerusalem has been interrupted this week because of Rosh Hashanah and the coronavirus lockdown. On Friday, Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit and the Health Ministry issued directives stating that demonstrators must be divided into separate groups of up to 20 people each and must wear face masks at all time. The space allocated for the protest against Netanyahu in Jerusalem will be expanded to allow protesters to maintain social distancing. Some protesters, however, were undeterred by the lockdown and on Saturday a group of 200 people held an anti-lockdown, anti-Netanyahu protest at a Tel Aviv beach. They maintained that the surge in coronavirus cases and subsequent lockdown was a result of Netanyahu's mishandling of the crisis. Some of the protesters told Haaretz they were unemployed and that the lockdown has further threatening their livelihood.

News article:
Police arrested a man on Sunday night who was speeding toward barricades set up around a protest in Jerusalem as thousands of Israelis gathered for a weekly demonstration against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outside his official residence in Jerusalem. Police said they had “arrested a suspect who drove toward the police barricades and was a danger to protestors and police.” They did not immediately specify whether the incident was a near-accident or an intended attack. Video posted to social media showed a white Mini Cooper car coming to a screeching halt as officers called on the driver to stop, some of them with their guns drawn. Police then pulled the driver from the vehicle and wrestled him to the ground. Toward the end of the video, one officer appears to punch the suspect in the groin area before grasping him by the neck. It was not clear what prompted this. צילומים בלעדיים ל"שיחה מקומית" של החשוד בניסיון הדריסה בהפגנה בירושלים מבצע את המעשה ונעצר. מהמשטרה במחוז ירושלים נמסר כי החשוד הועבר לחקירה.

It was not immediately clear if the incident was an attempted attack or an accident. Some 3,000 people gathered late Sunday for the weekly protest against Netanyahu outside his official residence in Jerusalem, in the first such demonstration since the start of a renewed nationwide lockdown to combat the coronavirus pandemic and after fresh restrictions were announced on those taking part. Several hundred more protested outside his private residence in the seaside town of Caesarea. Netanyahu is charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. His criminal trial began in June, but he has refused to step down from office and denies any wrongdoing. Many demonstrators also protested against his handling of the coronavirus crisis. While protests were exempt from the new restrictions on movement and gatherings, which came into force Friday before Rosh Hashanah with the start of the three-week closure, police announced new social distancing regulations for demonstrations. Hundreds of demonstrators formed a convoy to Jerusalem, waving black flags out of their cars as they drove to the capital. Advertisement Police tried to divide demonstrators into “capsules” of 20 people, but did not physically enforce the efforts as the new guidelines are currently just a suggestion and have not yet been approved by the government. “I remind you that also during the lockdown it is permitted to protest,” retired air force Brig. Gen. Amir Haskel, one of the Sunday night protest organizers, said in a video earlier Sunday urging demonstrators to take part in the evening’s rally. Speaking outside the Prime Minister’s Residence, Haskel called for demonstrators to wear masks and maintain the social distancing guidelines. He also later shared photos showing protesters marking the street with chalk drawings to ensure distance between the demonstrators. “The demonstration this evening is a test for the continuation of our struggle.

Police have said the public has so far largely adhered to restrictions that came into effect Friday afternoon, in the government’s latest effort to curb the surging pandemic. The closure will remain in effect for at least three weeks. Israel, which has one of the highest daily infection rates per capita in the world, became the first developed country to order a second lockdown to fight the pandemic. Meanwhile, Israel’s coronavirus czar warned Sunday that virus numbers were reaching “emergency,” levels that could see the country face 600 deaths a month and ordering hospitals to add new virus wards. Prof. Ronni Gamzu said in an interview with Channel 12 news that he fears the number of COVID-19 patients in serious condition could reach 800 by the end of the week, a number that has been frequently touted as the maximum Israeli hospitals can cope with. The Health Ministry on Sunday reported another 1,906 coronavirus cases since midnight Saturday, bringing the number of infections since the pandemic began to 187,396. It also confirmed another seven deaths, raising the national toll to 1,236. The case number was significantly lower than recent days, but that likely reflected the drop in testing over the Rosh Hashanah holiday. The ministry said there are 52,262 confirmed active cases, including 643 in serious condition, with a record 170 on ventilators.

News article:
Hundreds of people took part in demonstrations calling for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s resignation around the country Thursday, as protest leaders vowed to continue to rally within the confines of a tightened national lockdown which will controversially introduce limitations on protests as part of an effort to bring the coronavirus outbreak under control. Some rallied at highway overpasses, while the largest gathering took place near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem. In a nod to restrictions already in effect, demonstrators in Jerusalem spread out chairs at the scene to maintain social distancing, unlike previous events where protesters were more tightly grouped together, drawing criticism that they were liable to spread the coronavirus. Under restrictions set to go into effect at 2 p.m. on Friday, people will be prevented from venturing more than one kilometer from their home in order to protest and rallies will be limited to groups of 20. Protests outside Netanyahu’s residence will be allowed to continue with up to 2,000 participants at a time, as long as they are divided into 20-person “capsules.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Critics have accused the prime minister of pushing through overbearing restrictions on movement and economic activity in order to also clamp down on the protests. One by one Thursday, former senior members in Israel’s defense establishment spoke from a central podium at Paris Square. Many compared the current government’s failure to contain a raging coronavirus outbreak to the failures which preceded the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Former Air Force brigadier general Amir Haskel, a veteran activist whose brief arrest in late June sparked the current protest wave, said that the restrictions on demonstrations were about politics, not public health. Advertisement “I think that the prime minister’s decision yesterday is a flagrant conflict of interest. He simply cannot place restrictions on protests against him,” Haskel told The Times of Israel. “The decision is based solely on his desire to silence us.” Haskel said that the organizers were planning on petitioning the High Court of Justice to overturn the restrictions. In the meantime, he said, demonstrations would continue across the country in accordance with the restrictions. “I stood for four years at intersections by myself, or with small groups, and protested. If necessary, we can return to the intersections,” Haskel said. “Maybe he will manage to [silence] us for a week, or two weeks. But this is Netanyahu’s swan song.” Yuval Carminovich, a lawyer from Tel Aviv, regularly attends the protests in Jerusalem. He told The Times of Israel that he intended to follow the new restrictions — even though he considered them “scandalous.” “I intend to abide by the law. If they say it’s illegal for me to demonstrate here, then I won’t. But this is a slippery slope which doesn’t have a clear end,” Carminovich said. Just outside the demonstration, video showed Channel 12 news correspondent Moshe Nussbaum and cameraman Hanan Shroitman heckled aggressively by a small group of protesters shouting right-wing and pro-Netanyahu slogans at them. The hecklers, some of whom got nose to nose with Nussbaum, called him “disgusting,” “a stinking journalist,” and a “leftist traitor,” among other insults. Advertisement The two eventually managed to leave the area after a police officer got between them and the hecklers. According to the channel, one heckler was detained. כתב הפלילים של חדשות 12 משה נוסבאום הותקף על ידי עשרת המפגינים בהפגנת הימין.

The Black Flag movement, an anti-Netanyahu protest group, vowed to continue demonstrating over the weekend despite the lockdown. “Israel does not have a functioning prime minister, it has a criminal defendant who is destroying any good the country has,” the movement said in a statement. “Today, it is already clear to every citizen that the problem with the country is not the synagogues, not the demonstrations, it is the number one defendant Benjamin Netanyahu.” The head of the Crime Minister protest group, Gonen Ben Yitzhak, has also vowed to continue demonstrating, but was not seen at the Paris Square demonstration. The protests are aimed mainly against Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, and against the government’s handling of the virus outbreak. Advertisement Dozens of protesters also rallied outside the Knesset building. Several threw bags of cow dung in the direction of the parliament building, Channel 12 news reported. Cyber and National Digital Matters Minister David Amsalem, who is also the liaison between the Knesset and government, was heckled by the protesters as he walked past them from the Knesset to the nearby Finance Ministry, the network reported. As the crowd became increasingly vocal, Amsalem’s security detail hurried him into the Finance Ministry premises. Amsalem, who later introduced the lockdown proposal for a Knesset vote at the plenum, accused opposition lawmakers of “leading anarchy” through the anti-government protests. Apparently referring his earlier clash with protesters, lamented their lack of respect for a government minister, telling the plenum that some had shouted at him “thief, swindler, I paid you NIS 10,000, go to prison” as well as calling him “fat” and “stinking.” The lockdown proposal, which requires Knesset approval, passed its first reading in parliament on Thursday evening by 36 votes in favor to 32 against. If approved, nearly all public transportation will be closed, as will the last educational institutions still open — mainly special education programs and private preschools. Israelis won’t be allowed to travel more than a kilometer (0.6 miles) from their homes. Police will be deployed on highways and at the entrances to cities and towns to ensure Israelis don’t attempt to travel during the lockdown. There were acrimonious debates in the cabinet this week over whether to allow the anti-government protests during the lockdown, with the Blue and White party insisting a government could not order protests against it to disband. Ministers also argued over the degree to which prayer gatherings should be restricted, with ultra-Orthodox parties Shas and United Torah Judaism pushing to leave synagogues open, even if new limits on the number of worshipers are imposed. Under a final compromise reached late Wednesday, synagogues will close beginning Friday, open in a limited capacity for the 25 hours of the Yom Kippur holiday, then close again on Monday night.

News article:
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Crowds protested outside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home on Saturday demanding he quit over his handling of COVID-19 - many angered by what they said were government attempts to use lockdown measures to stifle demonstrations. FILE PHOTO: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gives a statement as Israel imposes nightly curfews in dozens of towns and neighbourhoods to stem the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Beit Shemesh, Israel September 8, 2020. Alex Kolomoisky/Pool via REUTERS Long lines of cars drove along the main highway to Jerusalem in a protest convoy and groups gathered on bridges and junctions in other cities, also demonstrating about corruption charges against Netanyahu - charges he denies. The protests came a day after the government tightened COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, though parliament failed to pass one measure to restrict citizens’ protests to within 1 km (0.6 miles) of their homes. That measure would have effectively halted the weekly demonstrations outside Netanyahu’s residence which have built up over the summer. “I’m here to stop the destruction of Israel, to stop democracy dying,” said Amit Tirosh, 42, a doctor from central Israel. “Luckily parliament managed to stop the demonstrations’ halt at the last minute. Everyone should be here. We are at the edge of an abyss.” Netanyahu has rejected allegations that the tougher lockdown rules were in part intended to quash the protests, which he has often called “anarchist” and “ludicrous”. “We need the lockdown in order to save lives,” he said on Thursday. There was no official figure for the number of protesters on Saturday but Israel’s N12 News said thousands took part. Police said most of them complied with social distancing and face mask rules. Netanyahu’s government decided this week to tighten a three-week lockdown imposed on Sept. 18, hoping to keep Israelis at home, shutting down many businesses and limiting group prayers during the ongoing Jewish high-holiday season. On Saturday, Netanyahu urged Israelis in a video message on Twitter to pray in the open air rather than inside synagogues on Yom Kippur, the upcoming Jewish day of atonement and the holiest day in the Jewish calendar which begins on Sunday. Only 27% of Israelis trust Netanyahu’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, according to a survey published by the non-partisan Israel Democracy Institute on Wednesday. Israel imposed its first lockdown in March and then relaxed it in May as new cases tapered off. But infections have since surged, reaching daily highs of more than 7,000 among the population of nine million. The country is in recession with unemployment above 11%.

Israeli protesters have placed washing machines in front of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Jerusalem, local media reported yesterday. This came, according to the reports, after the Washington Post revealed that Netanyahu and his wife were carrying bags of their dirty laundry to the US in order to have them cleaned for free. Reporting an informed US official, the Washington Post reported: "Over the years, the Israeli leader has developed a reputation among the staff at the U.S. president's guesthouse for bringing special cargo on his trips to Washington: bags and suitcases full of dirty laundry." "The Netanyahus are the only ones who bring actual suitcases of dirty laundry for us to clean," another US official told the American daily. "After multiple trips, it became clear this was intentional." Israeli social media users posted pictures showing a number of washing machines in front of Netanyahu's house, in a symbolic protest against the prime minister's behaviour.

News article:
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Hundreds of Israelis demonstrated outside parliament on Tuesday against a government-backed bill likely to stifle protests near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home during the current coronavirus lockdown. Slideshow ( 5 images ) The proposed law, which the government said was aimed at curbing COVID-19 infections, bans Israelis from holding street demonstrations more than one kilometre (0.6 mile) from their homes. The measure, which critics said was really intended to block anti-Netanyahu protests, was approved by a parliamentary committee on Tuesday. It was expected to be ratified by the full Knesset (legislature) later in the day. Many of the thousands of protesters who have gathered weekly outside Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem to demand his resignation over his handling of the health crisis, and alleged corruption, have travelled there from other cities. Outside the Knesset on Tuesday, demonstrators waved Israeli flags, banged on drums and chanted in favour of free speech ahead of the vote. “They are denying us the right to protest because of political reasons not for health reasons and it’s mind-blowing, the frustration is beyond words, is beyond words. And a great worry,” said one of the demonstrators, Efrat Ben Barak, 40. Police said three protesters who tried to block city workers from taking down banners that were hung illegally were arrested. Israel went back into lockdown for at least three weeks on Sept. 18 after new COVID-19 cases climbed to around 7,000 a day in a population of nine million, overtaxing some hospitals. Bickering within Netanyahu’s coalition government prevented street protests from being included in activities restricted by the one-kilometre limit, such as family visits, before the Yom Kippur Jewish fasting day on Monday. Tuesday’s vote was necessary to add the demonstrations to that category and limit all protest gatherings to 20 people. Netanyahu says Israel has handled the health crisis relatively well and that he has no political motive in seeking to prevent street protests. He denies any wrongdoing in three corruption cases against him. Israel has reported 234,060 infections and 1,516 deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.

Thousands of anti-government demonstrators took to the streets on Thursday across Israel, protesting the latest measures limiting the right to protest during the country’s second coronavirus lockdown. Haaretz podcast: Israel in lockdown limbo, and what's really stuffed in Bibi's laundry suitcases Credit: Haaretz Small groups of protesters gathered near main roads and on bridges across the country, with some marching to the Knesset, with dozens already protesting at a junction nearby. In Tel Aviv, a car sped into a group of protesters and the driver fled shortly afterwards. One woman was lightly wounded after falling to the ground. Police have since arrested a suspect in the attack, and will ask the courts that he be remanded for five days. They said the investigation is ongoing and that an official complaint has not been filed yet. Witnesses and those involved in the incident have been called in to give their testimony. Clashes between protesters and police in central Tel Aviv. In his own version to police, the suspect said he got caught up at the scene and "couldn't drive away because I was surrounded. They broke my windshield so I panicked and fled." One of the women who was struck by the car, Dorit Zak, described the incident Friday morning in an interview with the Kan public broadcaster. She said “in absolute terms” that the car was standing still and that the driver suddenly stepped on the gas, as she and others crossed the junction. Open gallery view Protesters in Tel Aviv demonstrate against government's increased lockdown measures, October 1, 2020 Credit: Moti Milrod Zak emphasized that she had been walking across the junction when the incident occurred, and that she had not stopped, blocked the street, or otherwise provoked the driver. In her words, “I [didn’t do] anything. I simply walked, I didn’t even have time to respond.” The car hit her in the stomach, throwing her into the road and also injured a friend of hers who was walking alongside her, Zak said. Additional details were provided by the suspect on Friday to the effect that after his window was broken, he began driving home, but instead drove to a coronavirus police checkpoint and told an officer there that he had been attacked and felt that he was in danger. He said that the officer told him to drive home and file a complaint with the police. The suspect's legal counsel, Adv. Yifat Cohen, described her client as "terrified, frightened man in a storm of emotions" when she met with him at the police station. She described the incident as "an attempted lynching" by "three thugs who did not come to demonstrate, but rather to resort to brutal violence with assault tools and smashed the car window." She added that her client "fled because he felt an immediate danger to life. I do not want to think about what would have happened if he had not fled with the vehicle."

Credit: Deganit Engelberg Another demonstrator was injured by a police horse as officers to clear the streets of demonstrators by putting up barriers and blocking roads. The wounded protester was taken to hospital. When the demonstration ended, at around 1 A.M., police had detained 15 protesters altogether during clashes in spots around the city. They were released on Friday monring. On Wednesday night, the cabinet approved a long list of new regulations, one of which restricts protesters to a distance of one kilometer (0.6 miles) from their homes. This restriction is valid for one week. Organizers called the latest measures “the most draconian” ones ever enacted against Israeli citizens, and in a statement urged “all citizens to go out and protest in the most creative way the can, until we fix this legal insanity and return to protest on Balfour Street in full force,” referring to the site of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem, where mass protests have been taking place weekly for the past three months. A coalition of youth protest organizations said: "although despair is growing and the country is crumbling before our eyes - we will continue to fight for it in the streets. While Netanyahu and his government are sowing fear and destruction, and eradicating the basic rights of the citizens of Israel through legislation that is pale in the face of the most dictatorial countries in the Middle East, we will not remain silent or stand aside." “This is crazy,” said Micha Weiss, a resident of Jerusalem who participated in the protest. “It’s clear there’s use of legal measures to suppress the freedom of expression.” He called it “a slippery slope” and accused Netanyahu of “avoiding trial at any cost.” Hadas Inbar, who protested in her city of Ness Ziona in central Israel, said she sees “an awakening” over the past days. “There’s dozens of us here and energies run high,” she said. The government-backed legislation “brought many people out to the streets, and they’ll stay there, that’s for sure,” Inbar added. Public Security Minister Amir Ohana criticized the police Thursday after they provided security for a protest against the government decision to ban demonstrations during lockdown. Ohana, the minister responsible for the police, said that a protest without a police permit should not have been allowed to be held, and the police should not have provided security.

Israel’s second lockdown has shaken the country. Alongside the financial fallout, Israel is facing one of its biggest political crises in years, with the government restricting the right to protest, creating a dilemma for many: Express your right as a citizen to demonstrate or abide by the coronavirus restrictions. On Wednesday night, the coronavirus cabinet approved a long list of new regulations, one of which restricts protesters to a distance of one kilometer (0.6 miles) from their homes. This restriction is valid for one week. Members of the anti-Netanyahu protest movement have found a creative and simple solution: With the help of Google Maps, the activists have created a list of all the different locations where demonstrations are happening. That way, you can simply join a rally happening within the legally permitted distance of your home. Haaretz podcast: Israel in lockdown limbo, and what's really stuffed in Bibi's laundry suitcases Credit: Haaretz The list of protests includes spots within cities where people are convening as well as bridges and junctions where protesters are planning to convene, as they have in recent weeks. The map also includes a list of all the home addresses of Knesset members, so you can even protest outside their home if you live nearby. The map by the Black Flags protest group is not the only technological solution out there to help you exercise your legal right to demonstrate: Guy Tepper developed a website called “One Kilometer”. After providing your address, the site will refer you to a list of protests happening in your vicinity and will even provide a link to the WhatsApp group of that specific demonstrations’ organizers. >> Here’s the link to the full map Another group, called “Anu”, have also put together a list with all the upcoming protests. Their platform also allows you to put together a new protest in your neighborhood and invite others to join you. Thousands of anti-government demonstrators took to the streets on Thursday across Israel, protesting the latest measures limiting the right to protest during the country’s second coronavirus lockdown. Organizers called the latest measures “the most draconian” ones ever enacted against Israeli citizens, and in a statement urged “all citizens to go out and protest in the most creative way the can, until we fix this legal insanity and return to protest on Balfour Street in full force,” referring to the site of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem, where mass protests have been taking place weekly for the past three months. A coalition of youth protest organizations said: "although despair is growing and the country is crumbling before our eyes - we will continue to fight for it in the streets. While Netanyahu and his government are sowing fear and destruction, and eradicating the basic rights of the citizens of Israel through legislation that is pale in the face of the most dictatorial countries in the Middle East, we will not remain silent or stand aside."

Israel’s second lockdown has shaken the country. Alongside the financial fallout, Israel is facing one of its biggest political crises in years, with the government restricting the right to protest, creating a dilemma for many: Express your right as a citizen to demonstrate or abide by the coronavirus restrictions. On Wednesday night, the coronavirus cabinet approved a long list of new regulations, one of which restricts protesters to a distance of one kilometer (0.6 miles) from their homes. This restriction is valid for one week. Members of the anti-Netanyahu protest movement have found a creative and simple solution: With the help of Google Maps, the activists have created a list of all the different locations where demonstrations are happening. That way, you can simply join a rally happening within the legally permitted distance of your home.

Opposition lawmakers on Friday accused the coalition of shuttering small businesses to justify new emergency regulations that grant the government authority to limit the protests against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The accusations came after the Knesset’s Constitution Law and Justice Committee late Thursday night authorize the government’s emergency regulations to limit crowding. The new restrictions went into effect at midnight Thursday and will remain in force at least until October 7. The new rules bar would-be demonstrators from gathering more than 1 kilometer from their homes and limit protests to groups of 20 people. The law also prohibits indoor prayers at synagogues and bans people from visiting others’ sukkahs over the upcoming week-long Sukkot holiday, which begins on Friday night. During the session Yamina MK Ayelet Shaked, Yisrael Beytenu MK Oded Forer, and others said they were shocked to learn that small businesses were also included among gatherings the emergency regulations aimed at limiting. The ban for small businesses came despite regulations allowing for up to 10 people to gather inside of a building, deeply angering the opposition lawmakers at the committee. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Shaked, a former justice minister, accused the coalition lawmakers of scapegoating small business owners to justify the use of emergency regulations to limit protests. “The small businesses are not being allowed to operate because it’s clear that if they had approved that, it would have legally brought down [the legitimacy] for a ‘special state of emergency’ allowing for demonstrations to be restricted,” Shaked said during the committee meeting. While proponents of the restrictions say that they are intended to curb Israel’s rising curve of coronavirus infections, organizers involved in the anti-Netanyahu protest movement of the past three months have vociferously opposed the new regulations, saying that they violate their freedom to protest, and opposition MKs have accused the coalition of skewing COVID-related restrictions in an effort to thwart the demonstrations. Advertisement During a Channel 12 interview on Friday evening, Public Security Minister Amir Ohana (Likud) was asked to explain the inclusion of small businesses in the regulations, while also being accused of “obsessively” focusing on protests. “Do you know who is obsessively dealing with protests all of the time? Blue and White,” Ohana responded, without addressing the decision made by his colleagues at the Knesset hearing a day before. Despite serving together in a unity coalition, Likud and Blue and White have butted heads regularly in recent months over the ongoing protests against Netanyahu’s corruption charges and his government’s handling of the pandemic. Likud officials have claimed that the outdoor gatherings can cause the virus to spread and have moved to have them curbed, while Blue and White has pushed back against limiting the democratic right too broadly. The sides agreed to advance emergency regulations and legislation, with Blue and White getting on board, apparently wary of picking a fight over the issue of protests that would have stalled the implementation of other restrictions health officials deem crucial to curbing the virus as daily new COVID-19 case numbers have climbed to 9,000 on two recent days. According to the Health Ministry figures released Friday morning, 7,639 new infections were confirmed Thursday, a day after a record 9,021 new cases were confirmed. Advertisement Another 671 were recorded after midnight, with the number of COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began rising to 255,771. No new deaths were recorded overnight, with the national toll remaining at 1,622. According to the ministry, there were 70,660 active cases, with 807 people in serious condition, including 196 on ventilators. Another 268 were in moderate condition and the rest had mild or no symptoms. The Health Ministry said that 62,248 tests were performed Thursday, 12.3 percent of which came back positive, below the 13-15% daily positive test rates recorded over the past week.

Police arrested 38 anti-government protesters in Tel Aviv Saturday evening as tens of thousands demonstrated across the country and in front of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem for the 15th consecutive week. All but one of the arrested protesters were later released under restrictions. The protester who has not been released is suspected of attacking a police officer. A hearing on extending his detention is set to be held on Sunday morning. Haaretz podcast: Israel in lockdown limbo, and what's really stuffed in Bibi's laundry suitcases Credit: Haaretz Hundreds of demonstrations were held throughout the country under the slogan "a kilometer it is," referring to the government restriction passed last week that limited protesters to a one-kilometer radius from their homes amid the spike in coronavirus cases. Clashes between protesters and police broke out in Tel Aviv, with arrests taking place and mounted units deployed. Protesters breached police barricades near Habima Square and began marching through the city while blocking traffic. In south Tel Aviv, officers were documented punching protesters as they attempted to break through crowds. Police claim that protesters are violating coronavirus restrictions and disturbing the public order. A local police chief also claimed that protesters used violence against police, which included throwing eggs, and said that a policewoman was injured during the clashes, but did not elaborate on the claim. The police said in a statement: "Many demonstrators violated public order, blocked roads, ignored police instructions and resorted to physical and verbal violence." Police also added that they handed out hundreds of fines to demonstrators in the city over alleged violation of restrictions. Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai was also seen at the protest in Tel Aviv and appeared to have been lightly injured amid the clashes, although it was unclear exactly how he sustained the injury. Huldai said that he was feeling well. The Black Flag protest movement estimated that 130,000 people took part in Saturday's protests against Netanyahu in cities and towns across the country. Before the clashes broke out, dozens of police officers circled the roughly 1,000 protesters in Tel Aviv's Rabin Square, approaching protesters in order to check if their place of residence is within one kilometer of the protest. Police also handed out fines to protesters, and confirmed late Saturday night that they had handed out hundreds of fines in Tel Aviv alone for violations of the emergency regulations. The rallies, which began on Thursday and Friday in the wake of the new distance limitations on protests, are a joint effort by organizations that have been protesting against Netanyahu’s continued tenure despite having been criminally indicted for bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in three cases.

News article:
Thousands of Israelis around the country demonstrated against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in small groups and within a one-kilometer range of their homes on Tuesday evening, in accordance with lockdown rules. Several hundred people gathered at Habima Square in Tel Aviv. A Times of Israel reporter at the scene estimated some 700 people were gathered in the square, with many more streaming in. Social distancing among protesters was inconsistent. Police were mostly staying away, avoiding confrontations seen at the square during Saturday protests. Officials had warned earlier that any mass gathering in the city would constitute a breach of health regulations. “Unfortunately, we have encountered calls by some organizers to turn the protest spots into ‘one huge march in the streets of Tel Aviv,'” police said, adding that this would represent a violation of the law. Some small scale scuffles were reported as police hemmed in protesters who attempted to march down Rothschild Boulevard, though calm was being maintained for the most part, if not social distancing. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms In a change from the typical police announcement that the gathering is illegal, an officer announced through a megaphone: “We’re not against you, but you are all putting your health in danger.” The rallies at hundreds of sites came three days after the last protests across the country, when tens of thousands participated in small, socially distanced rallies throughout Israel. This in the wake of the passage of highly contentious legislation last week that banned mass demonstrations as part of the coronavirus lockdown restrictions. In response, localized rallies have mushroomed along with mobile phone apps giving users locations of demonstrations near their homes. Advertisement On Saturday, orderly conduct at rallies at times gave way to more chaotic scenes of scuffles between protesters and police. Police said 38 people were arrested in Tel Aviv alone for “violating public order and attacking police officers.” All but one were released the following day. There were reports of protesters being assaulted by opposing activists, with several requiring hospitalization and one person suffering a broken arm. Facing accusations of heavy-handed policing against protesters, Acting Police Chief Motti Cohen on Sunday defended the force’s actions and said police would continue to enforce the law. His remarks drew condemnation from protest movement leaders, who accused the police of surrendering to the political leadership they believe seeks to stamp out the protests. Demonstrators, who are demanding Netanyahu resign over the corruption charges against him, alleged that police used excessive force, and footage showed protesters being shoved or punched on Saturday. “We will continue to enforce the law and regulations impartially and maintain public peace, security and health,” Cohen said at a police situation assessment meeting. Advertisement He said he supports the force’s commanders and officers who are facing a “complicated challenge and many tasks in the face of ongoing lack of appreciation.” Describing the county as being in an “emergency situation” due to the coronavirus outbreak, Cohen called on the populace to abide by instructions and listen to officers who are enforcing the law. On Sunday the Tel Aviv Magistrate’s Court extended the remand of Pini Luzon, 35, who is suspected of ramming his car into protesters in Tel Aviv during a Thursday night rally. Luzon claims he became afraid when he was surrounded by demonstrators and accelerated away. משטרת תל אביב מבצעת בשעה זו סריקות לאיתור הנהג שדרס את המפגינות. הוא ייעצר ברגע שיימצא. למי שלא בטוח שמדובר בניסיון דריסה, ראיתי בעיניי כיצד הוא מתעצבן שנאלץ להמתין שהצעידה תעבור, לוחץ על דוושת הגז ודוהר לכיוון המפגינים שבדרכו, לא מאט גם כשפוגע, ולאחר מכן טס ברמזור אדום ונמלט pic.twitter.com/XvLHFpbfzU — עמרי מניב omri maniv (@omrimaniv) October 1, 2020 The Black Flag movement has estimated that over 100,000 people protested throughout the country on Saturday. The figure, if accurate, would make the demonstrations collectively the largest yet held since protests gathered steam over the summer, fueled by anger at Netanyahu — who has refused to step down despite being on trial for alleged graft — and at his government’s mishandling of the coronavirus crisis. New measures passed last week bar Israelis from traveling more than a kilometer from their homes to protest and limit demonstrations to socially distanced groups of 20, although they apparently also allow for multiple groups of 20 in “capsules” in areas with sufficient space for social-distancing between the capsules. The approval of the restrictions was seen as a blow to the weekly demonstrations outside Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem. However, Saturday’s mass turnout throughout the country indicated it may have only served to further galvanize opposition to Netanyahu. AFP contributed to this report.

Thousands of Israelis around the country demonstrated against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in small groups and within a one-kilometer range of their homes on Tuesday evening, in accordance with lockdown rules. Several hundred people gathered at Habima Square in Tel Aviv. A Times of Israel reporter at the scene estimated some 700 people were gathered in the square, with many more streaming in. Social distancing among protesters was inconsistent. Police were mostly staying away, avoiding confrontations seen at the square during Saturday protests. Officials had warned earlier that any mass gathering in the city would constitute a breach of health regulations. “Unfortunately, we have encountered calls by some organizers to turn the protest spots into ‘one huge march in the streets of Tel Aviv,'” police said, adding that this would represent a violation of the law. Some small scale scuffles were reported as police hemmed in protesters who attempted to march down Rothschild Boulevard, though calm was being maintained for the most part, if not social distancing.

This in the wake of the passage of highly contentious legislation last week that banned mass demonstrations as part of the coronavirus lockdown restrictions. In response, localized rallies have mushroomed along with mobile phone apps giving users locations of demonstrations near their homes. Advertisement On Saturday, orderly conduct at rallies at times gave way to more chaotic scenes of scuffles between protesters and police. Police said 38 people were arrested in Tel Aviv alone for “violating public order and attacking police officers.” All but one were released the following day. There were reports of protesters being assaulted by opposing activists, with several requiring hospitalization and one person suffering a broken arm. Facing accusations of heavy-handed policing against protesters, Acting Police Chief Motti Cohen on Sunday defended the force’s actions and said police would continue to enforce the law. His remarks drew condemnation from protest movement leaders, who accused the police of surrendering to the political leadership they believe seeks to stamp out the protests. Demonstrators, who are demanding Netanyahu resign over the corruption charges against him, alleged that police used excessive force, and footage showed protesters being shoved or punched on Saturday. “We will continue to enforce the law and regulations impartially and maintain public peace, security and health,” Cohen said at a police situation assessment meeting. Advertisement He said he supports the force’s commanders and officers who are facing a “complicated challenge and many tasks in the face of ongoing lack of appreciation.” Describing the county as being in an “emergency situation” due to the coronavirus outbreak, Cohen called on the populace to abide by instructions and listen to officers who are enforcing the law. On Sunday the Tel Aviv Magistrate’s Court extended the remand of Pini Luzon, 35, who is suspected of ramming his car into protesters in Tel Aviv during a Thursday night rally. Luzon claims he became afraid when he was surrounded by demonstrators and accelerated away. משטרת תל אביב מבצעת בשעה זו סריקות לאיתור הנהג שדרס את המפגינות. הוא ייעצר ברגע שיימצא. למי שלא בטוח שמדובר בניסיון דריסה, ראיתי בעיניי כיצד הוא מתעצבן שנאלץ להמתין שהצעידה תעבור, לוחץ על דוושת הגז ודוהר לכיוון המפגינים שבדרכו, לא מאט גם כשפוגע, ולאחר מכן טס ברמזור אדום ונמלט pic.twitter.com/XvLHFpbfzU — עמרי מניב omri maniv (@omrimaniv) October 1, 2020 The Black Flag movement has estimated that over 100,000 people protested throughout the country on Saturday. The figure, if accurate, would make the demonstrations collectively the largest yet held since protests gathered steam over the summer, fueled by anger at Netanyahu — who has refused to step down despite being on trial for alleged graft — and at his government’s mishandling of the coronavirus crisis. New measures passed last week bar Israelis from traveling more than a kilometer from their homes to protest and limit demonstrations to socially distanced groups of 20, although they apparently also allow for multiple groups of 20 in “capsules” in areas with sufficient space for social-distancing between the capsules. The approval of the restrictions was seen as a blow to the weekly demonstrations outside Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem. However, Saturday’s mass turnout throughout the country indicated it may have only served to further galvanize opposition to Netanyahu. AFP contributed to this report.

Hundreds of small, "capsule" anti-government protests took place in cities and communities all over Israel on Tuesday evening, in line with lockdown restrictions, allowing people to demonstrate 1 kilometer from their homes, while keeping a safe distance. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The downsized and dispersed protests against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took place three days after a mass demonstration in Tel Aviv, which defied lockdown directives, descended into violence, resulting in 38 arrests. 5 View gallery Anti-Netanyahu protest in Tel Aviv ( Photo: AFP ) This time around police officers initially kept their distance from the protests, with a source within the force saying that officers would "not get involved as long as rules are adhered to." But after several hours clashes once again broke out in Tel Aviv as protesters attempted to breach police barriers. Protestors attempted to march from Tel Aviv's Habima Square onto Rothchild Boulevard, but were turned back by police officers, who surronded the whole area. 5 View gallery Scuffles once again break out between police and protesters ( Photo: Tal Shahar ) Several of the demonstrators managed to escape the perimeter and march onto nearby streets, where they were fined by the officers. Protestors also reported that food was thrown at them from a balcony of one of the residential buildings. Earlier, protesters in Ramat Gan reported that strangers pelted them with eggs and cursed them. Dorit, one of the demonstrators, said she believed the eggs came from one of the windows of a nearby building. "Vehicles drive by us, call us names and make obscene gestures," she said. "We called the police and wait for them to arrive here." 5 View gallery Protesters at Habima Square ( Photo: Motti Kimchi ) In Tel Aviv earlier officers arrived at Rabin Square where hundreds of protestors had already gathered, to make sure those at the plaza were no more than 1 kilometer away from their homes and were demonstrating in line with the coronavirus restrictions. Hundreds of protestors had also gathered at Habima Square, where violent clashes took place between demonstrators and police on Saturday. At Kibbutz Metzer in northern Israel, some 150 people arrived for the local rally, including the community's elders on mobility scooters draped in black flags. Anti-Netanyahu protestors in Kibbutz Metzer Demonstrators also gathered near the West Bank settlement of Adumim and Kibbutz Sde Boker in the Negev. In Jerusalem, protest leaders organized what they call a "Balfour Rally", with dozens of participants running or biking across the city toward Netanyahu's official residence at Balfour Street. A resident of Jerusalem's Ir Ganim neighborhood said that "in line with the lockdown directives, we decided to demonstrate by running through the city's main squares and continue to demonstrate against a prime minister who is charged with corruption." 5 View gallery Anti-Netanyahu protestors in Kibbutz Sde Boker ( Photo: Roee Idan ) The leaders of the protest movements said they will not tolerate violent conduct by the police, which they added was targeted at them during Saturday's protest in Tel Aviv. "Over the past few days, the police have used unrestrained violence against the protestors," they said in a statement. "We call on the police to behave as the 'police of the people.' We will not stand for the violence used against both secular and ultra-Orthodox demonstrators. We will not stand silent against this harsh treatment." 5 View gallery Anti-PM protester in Tel Aviv ( Photo: AFP ) A police spokesperson said that officers will enforce social distancing and face mask rules during the rallies in accordance with the outline. "A static protest in line with coronavirus restrictions is allowed, but marches are not approved and are illegal," the spokesperson said.

News article:
Israelis flocked to the streets to decry the government's ban on mass demonstrations, which they see as a distraction from PM Benjamin Netanyahu's corruption trial. The noisy gathering ended up in scuffles with police. The crowd, numbering hundreds, amassed in Tel Aviv when night fell on Tuesday, carrying homemade placards that demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Others were seen waving flags and chanting slogans in unison. At some point, the demonstration became chaotic although police began to get things under control. Officers – some armed, some wearing riot gear – didn't deploy any crowd control measures but used their hands to push protesters away. Demonstrators flocked to the streets in defiance of new measures passed last week, which prohibit Israelis from traveling more than a kilometer from where they live to protest – and limit rallies to socially-distanced groups of up to 20 people. Critics see the ban as an infringement of freedom of speech and a smokescreen to deflect public attention from Netanyahu. The long-serving prime minister, who is on trial for alleged bribery, fraud, and breach of trust, denies any wrongdoing. Protesters believe Netanyahu is using the crisis in order to remain in power. "We are afraid that he is trying to create a civil war between us. He certainly does increase the hatred between Israelis," a local man explained to Ruptly video agency. Another one had accused the PM – or Bibi, as he came to be known among Israelis – of "stealing our democracy." "He is a thief and he is a criminal," the protester insisted. The protest action comes amid a strict coronavirus lockdown that saw Israel shut down much of its economy and mandated people to stay indoors whenever possible in a bid to contain a surge in Covid-19 infections. The Jewish state has recorded over 277,000 cases and close to 1,800 fatalities.

"Police arrived at the synagogue in Modi'in Illit and asked the crowd to leave the area. The officers were attacked with stones and firecrackers. During the riots, four police officers were injured, seven suspects were detained," the press service said. In addition, the police have taken measures to ensure that the rules and regulations of the ministry of health are observed in Jerusalem. There were incidents with throwing stones and iron rods and 17 people were detained for participating in the riots. Israel has been gripped by anti-government demonstrations since July, with citizens calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down, citing public dissatisfaction with the authorities’ response to COVID-19 and consequences of the pandemic, primarily the ongoing economic crisis.

No protesters needed medical attention, according to police. One of the protesters who came under attack said he will file a complaint at the Holon police station over the alleged assault.

At the beginning of the week, four people were arrested in Holon after spraying demonstrators with tear gas. Some protesters accused Netanyahu of not condemning violence against them and also directed their ire at his coalition partner, Defense Minister Benny Gantz, for not taking a harsher stance against the violence. 3 View gallery La Familia activists at an anti-Netanyahu protest ( Photo: Kobi Koankes ) "The fact that the Israeli prime minister has not once condemned the violence against the protesters is a green light for violence against citizens of the country," they said. "Gantz. who sits [in the government] with the national instigator, is also complicit for this disgrace. A government that incites against its citizens and leads to severe violence against them is a danger to the existence of the State of Israel."

DUBAI: One person is dying from COVID-19 every three minutes in Iran, state television said on Wednesday, as the health ministry reported a record daily toll of 415 fatalities. Parliament speaker Mohammad Baqer Ghalibaf tweeted that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, the latest among dozens of officials to be infected. Non-essential businesses have been shut in Tehran and dozens of other cities as cases rise again in the Middle East's worst-hit country. Schools, theatres and museums have been shut and social, cultural and religious events cancelled for at least a week. Iranian authorities have blamed the sharp increase on people failing to follow restrictions. Total fatalities from the disease have reached 33,714, health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari told state TV. The number of confirmed cases rose by 6,824 in the past 24 hours to 558,648, she added. Some experts have doubted the accuracy of Iran’s official coronavirus tolls. A report by the Iranian parliament’s research centre in April suggested that the coronavirus tolls might be almost twice as many as those announced by the health ministry.

News article:
TEHRAN: Iran warned on Wednesday it will not tolerate "terrorists" near its border with Azerbaijan, after France and Russia raised the alarm over the deployment of Syrian militants in the Karabakh conflict. "It is unacceptable for us that some people want to send terrorists from Syria and other places towards regions near our frontiers," President Hassan Rouhani said, quoted on state television. Iran borders Armenian-held areas of Azerbaijan near Nagorno-Karabakh that have seen fighting. Armenia and Azerbaijan have for decades been locked in a conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnically Armenian area which broke away from Baku in a 1990s war that cost about 30,000 lives. Heavy fighting erupted on September 27 in one of the most combustible frozen conflicts left over from the collapse of the Soviet Union. Turkey has been accused of deploying fighters from Syria to support Azerbaijan in Karabakh. French President Emmanuel Macron said Ankara had sent Syrian "Jihadists" to the region, accusing Turkey of crossing a "red line". Turkey has not responded publicly. Russia and Armenia have also said that fighters from Syria and Libya are being deployed on the Azeri side in the conflict. Rouhani, which has good relations with both Yerevan and Baku, reiterated on Wednesday that "occupation is in no case acceptable". "Everyone" must "accept the reality... and respect other countries’ territorial integrity", he said. Rouhani at the same time condemned "those who, on one side or the other, pour oil on the fire", without naming Turkey which has declared open support for Azeri military action to reclaim the enclave. Iran has called on both Armenia and Azerbaijan to cease hostilities and offered to facilitate talks. On Saturday, Tehran warned against any "intrusion" after mortar fire hit Iranian villages along the border. Fars news agency reported last Thursday that police dispersed demonstrations in northwest Iran in support of Azerbaijan. The Islamic republic is home to a large Azeri community, mainly in the northwest. According to some estimates, Azeris make up 10 million of the 80-million population of Iran, which is also home to almost 100,000 Armenians.Clashes between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces have displaced half of the population of the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region, an official said on Wednesday, as Russian President Vladimir Putin urged an end to a "tragedy" that shows no sign of abating. The fighting in one of the most combustible frozen conflicts left over after the fall of the Soviet Union erupted on September 27, with Azerbaijan insisting the Armemian-held region must return to Baku’s control. The conflict has gained an international dimension that has alarmed the West, with Turkey supporting Azerbaijan and Armenia hoping that Moscow, which has so far stayed on the sidelines, could step in. "Of course this is a huge tragedy. People are dying, there are heavy losses on both sides," Putin said during an interview with state-run television. Even if the longstanding conflict could not be resolved, a ceasefire must be agreed "as quickly as possible", added Putin, who earlier held his first telephone talks with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev since the latest fighting began. Intermittent shelling by Azerbaijan’s forces has turned Karabakh’s main city Stepanakert into a ghost town dotted with unexploded munitions and shell craters. Much of Stepanakert’s 50,000-strong population has left, with those remaining hunkering down in cellars. They were disturbed by air raid sirens throughout the night as multiple explosions went off in a city plunged into total darkness. The city was hit by new strikes in the morning, with smoke visible and buzzing indicating the source was a drone, an AFP correspondent said.

News article:
Armenia and Azerbaijan held their first high-level talks on Friday after nearly two weeks of fierce clashes over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, with hopes rising that a ceasefire could be brokered in Moscow. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, who has repeatedly vowed to use his military to retake the breakaway province, said the talks represented a historic opportunity for Armenia. "We are giving Armenia a chance to settle the conflict peacefully," he said. "This is their last chance." Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said his country was "ready for the resumption of the peace process" led by international brokers. France, which along with Russia and the United States is part of a group mediating the two countries' long conflict, said there was a chance of a breakthrough at the talks but it was far from certain. "We are moving towards a truce tonight or tomorrow but it's still fragile," President Emmanuel Macron's office said in a statement to AFP. Armenian and Azerbaijani defense officials said heavy clashes continued overnight and reported further civilian deaths, after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the meeting in Moscow late Thursday and appealed for a ceasefire on humanitarian grounds. Shelling started again on Friday in Stepanakert, the provincial capital of Karabakh, where an AFP journalist heard several loud explosions and saw the remains of a rocket in a crater next to a cemetery for dead soldiers. - Fledgling mediation efforts - Renewed fighting over Karabakh -- an ethnic Armenian region of Azerbaijan that broke from Baku's control in a devastating war in the early 1990s -- has claimed some 400 lives and forced thousands of people from their homes. The heavy clashes erupted late last month, with both sides blaming the other for the biggest outbreak in violence since a 1994 ceasefire left the status of Karabakh in limbo. The region's declaration of independence has not been recognized by any country -- even Armenia -- and the international community regards it as part of Azerbaijan. The Kremlin said late on Thursday that following a series of calls with Pashinyan and Aliyev, Putin had invited their foreign ministers to Moscow and called for an end to hostilities "to exchange dead bodies and prisoners". Putin's announcement of the talks came shortly after international mediators from France, Russia and the United States launched their first efforts to resolve the fighting in Geneva. The countries make up the "Minsk Group" that has sought a solution to the Karabakh conflict for decades but have failed to stop sporadic outbreaks of fighting. The negotiations in Geneva went ahead without Armenia, which refused to participate while the fighting was ongoing, and there were no public statements following the closed-door talks. - Mounting civilian toll - Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin during a visit to Yerevan reiterated that Russia was prepared to help bring about peace alongside Minsk Group members. "It's important to make sure that all hostilities are halted and to start a diplomatic settlement of the conflict," he said. Since the fighting restarted both sides have accused the other of shelling areas populated by civilians and thousands of people have been displaced by the clashes. Stepanakert is dotted with damaged buildings and unexploded ordnance following days of shelling. AFP journalists have also witnessed destruction in villages in Azerbaijan near the front line. Armenia accused Azerbaijan on Thursday of hitting the iconic Ghazanchetsots (Holy Savior) Cathedral leaving a gaping hole in its roof and several journalists injured. Armenia's rights ombudsman Artak Beglaryan told AFP this week that the renewed fighting has displaced around half of Karabakh's 140,000 residents and forced some 90 percent of its women and children from their homes. Dozens of civilians have been confirmed killed and the Armenian side has acknowledged 350 military deaths, while Azerbaijan has not admitted to any fatalities among its troops. Turkey's strong backing for Azerbaijan has sown fears in the West that the conflict could spiral into a full-blown war embroiling Ankara and Moscow, which has a military treaty with Armenia. Putin and Macron are among the world leaders to denounce the reported deployment of pro-Turkish fighters from Syria and Libya to Karabakh and Iran this week warned of "terrorists" who had joined the conflict from abroad.

News article:
As fighting intensifies between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, Washington’s silence is deafening. Domestic distractions are no excuse for the Trump administration to ignore a war that threatens to engulf Turkey, Russia and Iran, and place NATO partner Georgia in grave danger. Indeed, America is the sole power that can defuse the conflict and take a leadership role in a long-overdue peace settlement. Fierce fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan has not subsided since September 27, making negotiations more difficult with each passing day. Battles are taking place along the line of contact that has separated Azerbaijani and Armenian forces since the 1994 ceasefire. Armenian-controlled cities in the Nagorno-Karabakh region have been shelled, including the capital Stepanakert, as well as Azerbaijani villages on the other side of the line of contact, with both sides reporting civilian deaths. Armenian mid-range missiles have also hit civilian targets far beyond the conflict zone, reaching as far as the Absheron region near Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku. Several missiles hit Azerbaijan’s second-largest city, Ganja, located close to major oil and gas pipelines from the Caspian Sea to Europe. On October 6, Armenian forces reportedly fired a rocket targeting the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline in Azerbaijan’s Yevlakh region. The rocket barely missed the oil pipeline and the nearby South Caucasus natural gas line, but the threat to major energy, transportation and communication corridors remains high. Although Armenia blames Azerbaijan for shelling towns in Nagorno-Karabakh, the current military adviser to the Armenian prime minister, Vagharshak Harutyunyan, openly stated on Russian TV’s Vesti news program that the Armenian army is deliberately targeting the civilian population of Azerbaijan to create panic. For 30 years, the two sides have not been able to settle the conflict. While Armenia has tried to retain its war gains, Azerbaijan has insisted on ending Armenian occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven adjacent Azerbaijani districts — making up almost 14 percent of the country’s territory. Four United Nations resolutions and a UN General Assembly resolution have reaffirmed Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity calling on Armenia to withdraw its armed forces. The warring sides already refer to the fighting as the second Karabakh war. The difference with the first war, however, is that both are now heavily armed with more sophisticated weapons, including missiles and drones that can inflict far more destruction. Armenia and Azerbaijan are among the most militarized states in the world, with both being primarily armed by Russia. Baku has also purchased drones from Israel and Turkey. Most recently, Russia has supplied military equipment to Armenia via Iran, causing the large Azeri population in Iran to protest Tehran’s assistance to Yerevan. Videos from Iran show attacks on trucks carrying Russian weaponry to Armenia amid increasing restlessness among the estimated 20 million ethnic Azeris inside Iran. The Armenian media has blamed Turkey for the conflict, claiming that Ankara has sent Syrian fighters to help Azerbaijan and presenting Armenia as a defender against international terrorism. Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has also asserted that if Azerbaijan’s army succeeds, it would mean genocide for the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, referencing the genocide committed by the Ottoman Empire in 1915. He omitted the fact that 30 years ago it was Armenian forces that committed the ethnic expulsion of almost one million Azerbaijanis from Nagorno-Karabakh and its surrounding regions. Although Turkey has expressed strong support for Azerbaijan’s attempt to regain its territory, there is no evidence that Ankara is actively assisting Baku militarily. Ankara claims that a small number of Turkish F-16 warplanes stationed in Azerbaijan are not involved in the fighting, while the joint military drills that took place during the summer are routine events and much smaller than Russia’s multi-national Kavkaz 2020 exercises in southern Russia and Armenia. Moscow has been surprisingly reserved since the conflict erupted and may be banking on a short war that will make both sides even more dependent on Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has emphasized that Moscow’s military agreement with Yerevan only applies to the territory of Armenia. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov elaborated that Russia’s obligations under the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) do not extend to Karabakh. Faced with Moscow’s subdued response, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan stated that Yerevan could make concessions over the Nagorno-Karabakh region if Azerbaijan was ready to do the same. Washington now has a valuable opportunity to begin decisive international mediation not only to stop the armed conflict but also to negotiate a durable settlement. Previous formats, including the OSCE Minsk Group, co-chaired by Russia, France and the U.S., have obviously failed to resolve the conflict. While France is a weak party without the full force of the European Union, Russia has exerted an inordinate influence in the process and prefers to keep Armenia and Azerbaijan embroiled in a permanent dispute that serves its ”divide and rule” policy. U.S. leadership, with support from the EU and NATO allies, can not only defuse the war, it can also prevent the region from falling under even more pernicious Russian and Iranian influence.

Elsewhere in his remarks, the official accused Baku of “pursuing a policy of genocide against people who have been fighting for their freedom since 1988,” and alleged that “Turkey and international terrorism” were helping the Azeri side. Reporting that civilian objects in Karabakh have been attacked by rocket artillery and drones, Harutyunyan stressed that “universal human values are being violated, the civilian population is being annihilated, and after this they expect Artsakh to agree to their demands. This will not happen. Artsakh enjoys the right to self-defence, and will not be part of Azerbaijan.” Also on Sunday, Armenian Defence Ministry spokesman Artsrun Hovhannisyan reported that strike drones were being delivered to Azerbaijan from Turkey and Israel under the guise of humanitarian aid. Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed to halt fighting in the Nagorno-Karabakh starting Saturday at 12:00 local time after 10 hours of negotiations between the two countries’ foreign ministers in Moscow on Friday. Both sides have since accused one another of violating the truce. Armenia has repeatedly accused Turkey and Israel of involvement in the conflict, and has alleged that Ankara has deployed Syrian mercenaries in Karabakh. Baku has rejected these allegations, with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev saying last week that the country’s army of 100,000 was sufficient for Azerbaijan's operations in the region.

The same day, the Armenian side announced the destruction of Turkish-made drones in the combat zone, including over Stepanakert and Karabakh’s northern regions. Meanwhile, Baku reported that more than half a dozen civilians had been injured in the city of Terter in an Armenian artillery attack, and reported the destruction of an Armenian S-300 air defence system. Armenia denied the latter claim, and accused Azerbaijan of transferring control of air operations inside Karabakh to the Turkish Air Force. The war extended into cyberspace, with both sides releasing footage of the alleged destruction of enemy troops and equipment. Baku also accused Armenian forces of employing the Tochka-U tactical missile system. Yerevan denied this, and reported that Karabakh self-defence forces had turned back attacks on the breakaway from the north and south. On Thursday, October 1, Azerbaijan again reported that civilian areas in Terter had come under attack, and that one civilian was killed. The Armenian side reported the destruction of three Azerbaijani Air Force Su-25s and two Mi-24 helicopters, with one of the aircraft said to have gone down over Iran. The Azeri side denied the claims and reported that all its aircraft were “combat-ready and fully operational.” Baku also accused Armenia of hiring foreign mercenaries from the Middle East. October 1 also saw two French journalists from Le Monde injured in the conflict zone, with several other foreign and Armenian journalists said to have come under fire. Yerevan recalled its ambassador to Israel for talks over Tel Aviv’s supply of arms to Baku. On October 2, the European Union formally called on Turkey to stop its blatant interference in the Karabakh conflict. The same day, a bipartisan group of 49 US lawmakers called on the State Department to formally “clearly and unequivocally condemn Azerbaijan’s unreasonable aggression” and to threaten a cut-off of US aid. French President Emmanuel Macron announced that Paris had evidence that 300 Syrian jihadist militants had been transferred to the Karabakh warzone through Turkey.

Baku reported that Armenian artillery had again shelled Terter, as well as several Azerbaijani villages. 'Unprecedented' Fighting On October 3, as the flare-up neared the one week mark, President Aliyev announced that Armenia had “destroyed” the Karabakh negotiations process, stressed that Turkey is not involved in the conflict militarily in any way, shape or form, and suggested that Russia has a “special” role to play as a mediator owing to its good historical relations with both Azerbaijan and Armenia. The same day, Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan called the scale of the conflict unprecedented, and suggested that Armenia would be ready to discuss the deployment of Russian peacekeepers.

News article:
Russia on Monday urged Armenia and Azerbaijan to immediately start observing a ceasefire agreed over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region as intense fighting between the two Caucasus rivals cast fresh doubt over the accord. The clashes have raged for the last two weeks over the breakaway region of Azerbaijan controlled by Armenians after a 1990s war and whose independence is recognised by no state. The fighting, the worst since a 1994 ceasefire, has sparked fears of a regional conflict, with Turkey backing Azerbaijan, Armenia seeking to pull ex-Soviet ally Russia in on its side and Iran looking on warily. After 11 hours of talks between the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers in Moscow, the two sides agreed early Saturday to a humanitarian ceasefire. But repeated clashes have so far made a mockery of the truce deal, with both sides Monday accusing the other of repeated violations. "We expect that the decisions that have been adopted will be rigorously observed by both parties," said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow after hosting his Armenian counterpart Zohrab Mnatsakanyan. The truce -- whose immediate aim was to exchange prisoners and the bodies of people killed -- had to be implemented on the ground and work was underway to ensure verification mechanisms were in place, he added. Lavrov said he believed the "all-night vigil" that clinched the ceasefire would "not be in vain" and that the issue could be resolved on the ground "in the nearest time". French foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said it was "indispensable and urgent" that the truce was "strictly" obeyed. An AFP correspondent in the Azerbaijani town of Barda not far from the front line heard thumping echoes of shelling Monday morning and the noise intensified in the afternoon. In the Azerbaijani village of Otuzikiler where many have fled from shelling, 42-year-old Gultekin Rakhimova said her three small children had not slept properly since rockets rained down on their houses two weeks ago. "They wake up and cry. They have nightmares because the dead come back in their dreams," she said as one of her boys tossed pebbles at a rooster outside their temporary new home in a village school. In Karabakh's main city of Stepanakert, an AFP photographer heard shelling from the direction of the town of Hadrut. "Armenian armed forces, who did not comply with the humanitarian truce, repeatedly tried to attack the positions of the Azerbaijan army," the Azerbaijani defence ministry said. Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said Azerbaijan was "now intensively shelling the southern front". The 1990s war -- which ended with the 1994 ceasefire that did not present a long-term solution to the conflict -- cost the lives of about 30,000 people. Nearly 600 people, including 67 civilians, have been killed in the latest fighting since last month, according to a tally based on tolls given by both sides. Analysts have long warned that Nagorno-Karabakh was the most combustible of the unresolved conflicts left over after the fall of the Soviet Union, with Azerbaijan vowing to regain control of the territory and Armenians insisting they would never cede ground. The so far fruitless, decades-long search for a settlement over Karabakh has been overseen by the Minsk Group of world and regional powers chaired by senior diplomats from France, Russia and the United States. Mnatsakanyan was due to meet the Minsk Group co-chairs in Moscow after his discussions with Lavrov. Renewed fighting has stoked fears of a full-blown war embroiling Turkey, which strongly backs Azerbaijan and has been accused by Paris and Moscow of sending pro-Ankara Syrian militiamen to help Baku. Lavrov said Monday that his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu had in telephone talks expressed his support for the Moscow ceasefire deal. But in another call Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar urged his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu to convince Armenia to withdraw from Karabakh, warning "Azerbaijan will not wait 30 more years for a solution". Russia has a military base in Armenia and counts Yerevan as an ally in the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO). Iran, which has warm relations with Armenia and is wary of Baku's military cooperation with Israel, has also expressed alarm over the reports of Syrian militia being sent to Azerbaijan. Iran's foreign ministry expressed regret "over the violation of the announced ceasefire", urging both sides to resume talks.

The International Committee of the Red Cross urged Armenia and Azerbaijan on Tuesday to finalize arrangements for it to handle an exchange of detainees and bodies from the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, after a humanitarian ceasefire agreed at the weekend. “To date we keep discussing intensely with the sides on this topic. But no meaningful agreement has been reached yet that will allow us to actually proceed to such an exchange,” Martin Schuepp, ICRC Eurasia regional director, told a news briefing in Geneva, adding that it was passing proposals “back and forth.” Advertisement “So discussions are going on with the sides, and we hope that the conditions will be met in order to actually implement such an operation in the future,” he said, also calling for security guarantees to be provided for ICRC staff.

News article:
The new humanitarian truce follows four weeks of conflict over the disputed region. Two previous Russia-brokered agreements have broken down, with both Armenia and Azerbaijan blaming the other for a return to violence. The United States, Armenia and Azerbaijan announced a new cease-fire agreement over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region that will take effect at 8:00 a.m. local time (0400 UTC/GMT) on Monday. The deal follows nearly a month of fresh conflict in the region, internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but run by ethnic Armenians, entered its fifth week. Two previous temporary truces, broken by Russia, have failed to hold. Shortly after the cease-fire took effect on Monday, Armenia and Azerbaijan accused each other of violating the agreement. The Azerbaijan Defense Ministry said Armenian forces had shelled villages in the Terter and Lachin regions. The Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Ministry denied the claim, saying it was "misinformation" and that Azerbaijian's military had launched a missile attack on Armenian forces. 'Intensive negotations' A joint statement from the three countries said the accord came after Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan and his Azerbaijani counterpart Jeyhun Bayramov met with senior US diplomats on Friday. "The United States facilitated intensive negotiations among the Foreign Ministers and the Minsk Group Co-Chairs to move Armenia and Azerbaijan closer to a peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict," Sunday's joint statement said. The warring parties agreed to abide by the terms of the humanitarian ceasefire agreed in Moscow on October 10, which were reaffirmed in the statement issued from Paris on October 17, the statement added. The US is one of three co-chairs, along with France and Russia, of the Minsk Group, established by the Organization for the Security and Cooperation of Europe (OSCE) to broker peace between the two former Soviet republics. Military death roll rising The latest positive development came hours after Armenia raised its military death toll to 974. Some 37 civilians have also been killed in fighting between Azeri and Armenian forces, which broke out again on September 27, it added. Azerbaijan has not disclosed its military casualties due to censorship under the martial law that applies in the region. But Baku did say 65 civilians were killed and more than 300 wounded on their side.

Fighting over the region has surged to its worst level since a war from 1991-1994 that killed some 30,000 people. Conflict rages on Local officials in Karabakh on Sunday had accused Azeri forces of firing artillery at civilian settlements during the night. Baku denied killing civilians and said its positions had been attacked with small arms, mortars, tanks, and howitzers. Azerbaijan also said it had downed an Armenian military aircraft, reports that Armenia denied. Meanwhile, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said Sunday they have deployed troops along the Islamic Republic's border with Armenia and Azerbaijan. Their mission was "to protect national interests and maintain peace and security," according to comments published by the IRNA news agency.

He tweeted that Azeri forces were "liberating Azerbaijan’s internationally recognized territory from occupation." His comments appeared to contradict an interview he gave on Saturday, where Aliyev said he wanted the fighting to stop and for all parties to "move to the negotiating table." "I am absolutely confident in the effectiveness of the peace negotiations but this also depends on the will of the Armenian side to take part in them," Azerbaijan's president said. Aliyev has said that Armenian forces need to withdraw from the disputed region to end the conflict. dv/mm (dpa, Reuters)

News article:
(MENAFN- AzerNews) By Trend Advisor to the Chief of the General Staff of the Armenian Armed Forces Vladimir Pogosyan made statements of a threatening character towards Turkey and Israel via social media networks, Trend reports. Speaking about the terrorist attacks in Europe, Pogosyan said that he was not interested in these attacks. 'Finally, Armenian politicians began to understand what are Europe and Israel, especially Israel, he said. "Today's Israel and Germany of 1933 are the same. We won't forgive anyone, and the time will come when we'll take revenge on you, know this," he added. Armenian Armed Forces launched a large-scale military attack on positions of the Azerbaijani army on the front line, using large-caliber weapons, mortars, and artillery on Sept. 27. Azerbaijan responded with a counter-offensive along the entire front. As a result of retaliation, Azerbaijani troops liberated a number of territories previously occupied by Armenia, as well as take important, strategic heights under control. The fighting continued into October 2020, in the early days of which Armenia has launched missile attacks on Azerbaijani cities of Ganja, Mingachevir, Khizi as well as Absheron district. The conflict between the two South Caucasus countries began in 1988 when Armenia made territorial claims against Azerbaijan. As a result of the ensuing war, the Armenian Armed Forces occupied 20 percent of Azerbaijan, including the Nagorno-Karabakh region and seven surrounding districts. The 1994 ceasefire agreement was followed by peace negotiations. Armenia has not yet implemented four UN Security Council resolutions on the withdrawal of its armed forces from Nagorno Karabakh and the surrounding districts. -- Follow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz

(MENAFN- AzerNews) By Trend Advisor to the Chief of the General Staff of the Armenian Armed Forces Vladimir Pogosyan made statements of a threatening character towards Turkey and Israel via social media networks, Trend reports. Speaking about the terrorist attacks in Europe, Pogosyan said that he was not interested in these attacks. 'Finally, Armenian politicians began to understand what are Europe and Israel, especially Israel, he said. "Today's Israel and Germany of 1933 are the same. We won't forgive anyone, and the time will come when we'll take revenge on you, know this," he added. Armenian Armed Forces launched a large-scale military attack on positions of the Azerbaijani army on the front line, using large-caliber weapons, mortars, and artillery on Sept. 27. Azerbaijan responded with a counter-offensive along the entire front. As a result of retaliation, Azerbaijani troops liberated a number of territories previously occupied by Armenia, as well as take important, strategic heights under control. The fighting continued into October 2020, in the early days of which Armenia has launched missile attacks on Azerbaijani cities of Ganja, Mingachevir, Khizi as well as Absheron district. The conflict between the two South Caucasus countries began in 1988 when Armenia made territorial claims against Azerbaijan. As a result of the ensuing war, the Armenian Armed Forces occupied 20 percent of Azerbaijan, including the Nagorno-Karabakh region and seven surrounding districts. The 1994 ceasefire agreement was followed by peace negotiations. Armenia has not yet implemented four UN Security Council resolutions on the withdrawal of its armed forces from Nagorno Karabakh and the surrounding districts. -- Follow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz

Tel Aviv - Asharq Al-Awsat Israel will begin human trials for a potential COVID-19 vaccine on Nov. 1 after receiving regulatory approval, the Defense Ministry announced on Monday. The Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) began animal trials for its “BriLife” vaccine in March. The Health Ministry and an oversight committee have now given the green light to take it to the next stage. The “Bri” is the first part of the Hebrew word for health; the “Il” stands for Israel and “life.” According to the ministry statement, 80 healthy volunteers, between the ages of 18 and 55, will be monitored for three weeks to see if virus antibodies develop. Two other phases will take place over a period of six months to ensure the vaccine is approved for mass use. The vaccine, the ministry said, has already tested well on a number of animal models and the IIBR has produced more than 25,000 doses for the first and second phases of the clinical trials. The Institute’s final goal is 15 million rations for Israelis and Palestinians, the ministry stressed. “This is a day of hope for the citizens of Israel, thanks to the researchers of the IIBR,” said Defense Minister Benny Gantz. He expressed gratitude for dozens of researchers who work day and night on this mission in full cooperation with the Health Ministry, pledging to provide the institute with all the means and support required to reach a safe and effective vaccine. The IIBR affirmed it obtained all the necessary authorizations from the Health Ministry to begin human trials, noting that it also obtained the approval of the US Department of Health. Meanwhile, Israel’s Channel 12 channel reported on Monday that the foreign intelligence service, Mossad, brought a Chinese coronavirus vaccine to Israel in recent weeks in order to study and learn from it. Israel is trying to reach agreements to purchase coronavirus vaccines from several other potential developers, according to an informed senior Health Ministry official. The coronavirus cabinet held a two-day meeting on Sunday, chaired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but found no radical solutions to the fundamental issues raised by the public on the current partial lockdown. Members agreed on the gradual reopening of the educational sector, with tighter fines imposed on violators of Health Ministry instructions, A $150 fine will be imposed on those who do not wear a mask, and $10,000 for those who open their shops without an approval from the ministry.

News article:
The first volunteer in trials for Israel’s new coronavirus vaccine has been released from the hospital, saying he feels “great.” Segev Harel, a 26-year-old undergraduate student, was injected at the Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan on Sunday, and was kept in the hospital for 24 hours of observation. In his first English-language comments, he said: “Hello everybody, good morning, thank you all for your support. “I’m here after spending the night in Sheba Medical, and now I’m going home and I feel great, and I hope we will bring the vaccine to Israel and to the whole world.” The vaccine, named Brilife, was developed by the Israel Institute for Biological Research. Some 15 million shots are already being produced, in the hope that the trial goes smoothly. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Eytan Ben-Ami, a Sheba doctor who is part of the team directing the trial, told The Times of Israel: “The first patient was kept in hospital for 24 hours to observe him in case of any adverse effects and there were none. “Everything has been really smooth. It’s very early in the process, but until now, everything is going according to plan.” Soon after Harel left Sheba, the second volunteer to receive a shot, Aner Ottolenghi, started the hospital discharge procedure. Ottolenghi, a 34-year-old doctoral student, had spent the night at Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center in Jerusalem, where he was given the shot. Advertisement A statement from Hadassah said that he “felt great this morning and spent the night without any symptoms or issues due to the vaccine. He says that he is sleeping well.” The first phase of the clinical trial is expected to last roughly a month and will involve some 80 volunteers ages 18 to 55. The second phase in December will test roughly 1,000 volunteers ages 18 to 85 at eight hospitals around the country. In this phase, volunteers with preexisting conditions will be allowed to participate. If that larger group responds well to the vaccine and antibodies are detected in their blood, injections will then be given to some 30,000 people in April or May 2021. If the vaccine works well and there are no significant side effects, it will then be approved for full use in the general population. Last Monday, the Defense Ministry announced that Israel had begun mass-producing the potential coronavirus vaccine and plans to distribute it to both Israelis and Palestinians if it is approved for use. The director of the state-run Israel Institute for Biological Research, Shmuel Shapira, said it will produce 15 million doses in the first stage and estimated the shot could be ready by July. Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.

The boss of one of Israel’s largest hospitals has placed a huge order for Russia’s Sputnik-V coronavirus vaccine, arguing that concerns over the formula are due to tensions between Moscow and Washington, rather than safety issues. Zeev Rotstein, director of Jerusalem’s Hadassah Medical Centre believes Western objections are more political than scientific, telling Israeli newspaper Haaretz, “it’s like the space race. It’s no wonder the Russians called the vaccine Sputnik 5. They wanted to remind the Americans who reached space first.” Rotstein said the “results and safety we’ve seen have been very good. There’s a good probability that the vaccine is safe. And there’s a reasonable probability ... that it’s also effective.” Also on rt.com No Sputnik V for you! EU insists only ‘approved’ Covid vaccines allowed after Orban says Hungary is in talks with Russia & China Russia drew criticism from some international scientists in August after becoming the first country to approve a vaccine for the virus. That’s despite promising clinical trial results published in The Lancet. Larger late-stage trials are still ongoing in Moscow and are due to conclude next week. From October, Israel partially eased a national lockdown, one of the strictest in the world, as the number of positive tests fell from 9,000 a day at the peak to 622 in the past 24 hours.

News article:
By Aryeh Stern YERUSHALAYIM — The Health Ministry is considering the option of recommending legislation requiring Israeli citizens to be vaccinated against coronavirus when the vaccine is made available in Israel. The debate came after an announcement by Pfizer that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective and could begin to be rolled out by the end of 2020. The move is intended to push members of the public who fear vaccination to immunize themselves and encourage the chances of herd immunity among the populace and those who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus. The ministry’s epidemic task force has previously expressed concern about public hesitation to receive a vaccine and the consequences should a large slice of the population refuse to be vaccinated. The task force proposed to step up the Health Ministry information campaign about the pandemic in order to provide additional information about the vaccination. The proposal may face legal opposition, however. “In principle, the State of Israel has until today refrained from legally requiring any vaccinations,” said Dr. Adi Niv-Yagoda, an expert in health policy and medical law at the Tel Aviv University. “Even today, the state allows a citizen to maintain autonomy and not be vaccinated with the routine vaccines recommended by the Health Ministry,” said Niv-Yagoda. “Many steps are taken to explain the importance of immunization. … Consequently the immunization rate [in Israel] is one of the highest in the world.” Niv-Yagoda said that despite the pandemic, a law forcing citizens to immunize themselves “constitutes a fatal violation of basic rights and freedoms of the individual. The way to achieve high immunization coverage is through advocacy and the establishment of trust between the government and the public.”

News article:
The Health Ministry has reneged on its previous opposition and plans to support a return to school for all grades in cities with low infection rates, Channel 12 news reported Saturday night. The matter had been expected to go up for discussion on Sunday evening, at a meeting of the coronavirus cabinet to discuss the government’s next steps on the coronavirus pandemic, However last Saturday it was announced that the meeting would be delayed to Monday, apparently to allow more work to be done by ministries before ministers convene. Health officials had previously raised objections to the swift return of schoolchildren to class. The Channel 12 report did not indicate what had led to the sudden change of course. Other news reports said health officials continue to be opposed to reopening schools. Currently, grades 1-4 are back in class, with grades 5-6 expected to join them on Tuesday, and grades 11-12 to return to the classroom a week later. Grades 7-10 are continuing distanced learning. Education Minister Yoav Gallant has long pushed for a return of most kids to school. On Saturday evening he tweeted: “Millions of students must immediately return to school. In the long months of extended lockdown they have accumulated significant educational gaps and have suffered loneliness. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “The consequences of the extended lockdown will be with these children for a long time,” he said. “We must not forget Israel’s future generation.” Channel 12 also reported that with Jerusalem’s latest deals for vaccines with pharma companies Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Arcturus, Israel is expected to have doses for 12 million people — enough vaccines for everyone in the country. However, none of the deals guarantee a deadline for the arrival of the agreed-upon vaccines, and with mass global demand, it is still not clear how many vials Israel will get, and when. Advertisement And though all the companies are in various advanced stages of development and testing, no vaccine has so far been approved for general use by regulators in the US and Europe. Channel 12 reported that since Israel signed its latest major deal — with AstraZeneca — long after the US and Europe, it is likely to be at the bottom of the waiting list and see significant delays in supply. Israel is also in talks with Russia to receive its “Sputnik V” vaccine, though some experts have questioned its opaque certification process. “We will continue to work to ensure that we will have as many vaccines for as many citizens, from as many sources and as fast as possible,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday, Pfizer said Friday it is asking US regulators to allow emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine, starting the clock on a process that could bring limited first shots as early as next month. Moderna is also expected to seek emergency authorization within weeks Advertisement AstraZeneca is not as far along in the process, but the company announced Thursday that in initial trials its vaccine has shown to safely produce a robust immune response in healthy older adults. The vaccine produced fewer side effects in people aged 56 and over than in younger people — a significant finding given that COVID-19 disproportionately causes severe illness among seniors, the company said as it released its phase 2 trial results. The manufacturers said the vaccine was undergoing larger, more comprehensive phase 3 trials to confirm the results. A vaccine is seen as the best hope to break the cycle of deadly virus surges and severe restrictions across much of the world since COVID-19 first emerged in China late last year and unleashed devastation on the global economy. So far, 1.2 million people have died of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Israel is also working on a home-grown vaccine, though it is currently only in phase 1 trials and its development is expected to take months longer than the foreign candidates.

The manufacturers said the vaccine was undergoing larger, more comprehensive phase 3 trials to confirm the results. A vaccine is seen as the best hope to break the cycle of deadly virus surges and severe restrictions across much of the world since COVID-19 first emerged in China late last year and unleashed devastation on the global economy. So far, 1.2 million people have died of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Israel is also working on a home-grown vaccine, though it is currently only in phase 1 trials and its development is expected to take months longer than the foreign candidates.

News article:
Israel’s domestically produced coronavirus vaccine will likely be ready for the public by the summer, according to a Friday report. The vaccine, called Brilife, was developed by the Defense Ministry’s Institute for Biological Research. The first phase of clinical trials began earlier this month. The volunteers who have received the vaccine in the trials have not experienced side effects, Friday’s Channel 12 report said, without citing its sources. Some 15 million shots are already being produced, in the hope that the trial goes smoothly. The Channel 12 report also said health officials are continuing to investigate Russia’s vaccine, called Sputnik V, and are currently against administering it to the public due to possible risks. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The first phase of Brilife’s clinical trial is expected to last roughly a month and will involve some 80 volunteers ages 18 to 55. The second phase in December will test roughly 1,000 volunteers ages 18 to 85 at eight hospitals around the country. In this phase, volunteers with preexisting conditions will be allowed to participate. If that larger group responds well to the vaccine and antibodies are detected in their blood, injections will then be given to some 30,000 people in April or May 2021. If the vaccine works well and there are no significant side effects, it will then be approved for full use in the general population. Advertisement Last month, the Defense Ministry announced that Israel had begun mass-producing the potential coronavirus vaccine and plans to distribute it to both Israelis and Palestinians if it is approved for use. The Institute for Biological Research, which operates under the auspices of the Defense Ministry on issues related to chemical and biological warfare, said it used state-of-the-art techniques to create its vaccine. The vaccine is named Brilife, a portmanteau of the Hebrew word for health — bri’ut — and life. The name also contains the abbreviation for Israel, IL, as well as the letters that make up the acronym of the laboratory, IIRB. Israel is producing a domestic vaccine as a backup plan while it also plans to purchase vaccines from pharmaceutical firms based abroad. Israel is in the final stages of talks with British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to purchase “millions” of doses of its vaccine, which is currently under trial, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Friday. Netanyahu said last week that Israel signed a deal with Pfizer to purchase millions of its coronavirus vaccine shots, days after the US pharmaceutical firm said data suggested the vaccine was 90 percent effective at preventing COVID-19. Advertisement On Monday, Moderna’s Israeli chief medical officer said Israel will be among the first countries in line to receive its vaccine, after the US company announced initial results showing the vaccine is 94.5% effective. Netanyahu on Monday spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the possibility of purchasing Russia’s coronavirus vaccine. Israel has shown interest in the vaccine ever since Russia announced that it was ready for human trials, and in early November the director of Jerusalem’s Hadassah Medical Center said the hospital had ordered 1.5 million units of the vaccine and would apply for Health Ministry approval for their use, pending the phase 3 trials. A vaccine is seen as the best hope to break the cycle of deadly virus surges and severe restrictions across much of the world since COVID-19 first emerged in China late last year and unleashed devastation on the global economy. Infection levels in Israel are creeping back up as the nation gradually emerges from its second nationwide lockdown. According to the Health Ministry, 417 new coronavirus cases were recorded Thursday, which along with another 417 by Friday evening brought the number of infections in Israel since the pandemic began to 327,748. The death toll stood at 2,744. Of the 8,460 active cases, there were 318 people in serious condition, including 123 on ventilators. Another 86 people were in moderate condition and the rest had mild or no symptoms. The Health Ministry said 55,003 tests were performed Thursday, 1.4 percent of which came back positive.

News article:
London: The developers of a coronavirus vaccine in Britain on Monday claimed success after mass testing, as the United States announced plans to give jabs to 20 million people before the end of the year to combat surging infections. AstraZeneca and Oxford University said their drug had proved on average 70 percent effective at stopping the virus after trying it on 23,000 people, days after tests of two other drugs suggested they had more than 90 percent effectiveness. The bright news on vaccines comes as Europe and the Americas battle rising caseloads that are pushing health systems to the brink, forcing governments to issue stay at home orders and close businesses even as the crucial Christmas period approaches. Canada’s biggest city Toronto will become the latest area to shut down later on Monday, as officials ban private indoor gatherings and limit the size of weddings and funerals -- similar to measures already in place in France and other European countries. "We can’t risk overwhelming our hospitals," said Doug Ford, premier of Ontario province, earlier this week. At the other end of the confinement cycle, Australia’s second-largest city Melbourne continued to emerge from a gruelling four-month lockdown with authorities lifting a ban on travel across state borders. "When I went across the border I beeped the horn, ‘Yahoo!’," said Melbourne resident Margaret Forster after being allowed to drive from Victoria into New South Wales for the first time since June. The latest vaccine results are particularly important as the Oxford drug can be transported easily at normal refrigerator temperatures -- unlike some of the other candidates, which need extremely cold storage. AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot said despite the vaccine’s lower effectiveness compared with the other candidate drugs, it would still be highly effective and would have an "immediate impact". The firm said it planned to develop up to three billion doses of the vaccine in 2021 if it passes the remaining regulatory hurdles. Two other leading candidates -- one by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech and another by US firm Moderna -- reported 95 percent effectiveness in trials. The European Union said it could approve vaccines for use by the end of the year, following a statement from US officials that a vaccination programme could be started as soon as next month. "Our plan is to be able to ship vaccines to the immunisation sites within 24 hours of approval," said Moncef Slaoui, head of the vaccine effort in the US, still the world’s worst-hit nation with more than 12 million infections and 255,000 deaths. The government’s vaccine advisers will meet on December 10 to discuss approval. Slaoui estimated that 20 million people across the US could be vaccinated in December, with 30 million per month after that. Meanwhile, the mounting number of coronavirus infections in densely-populated Gaza is spinning out of control, Palestinian health officials warned on Monday. "The virus is spreading and the situation is getting out of control," Dr. Ahmad al-Jadba, an official at Shifa hospital in Gaza City, told AFP. The health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory of two million inhabitants declared a record 24-hour high of 890 new cases between Friday and Saturday. In a related development, the World Health Organisation said on Monday, the planet’s poorest must not be trampled as countries scramble to get their hands on the vaccines. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the latest batch of promising results from final-phase candidate vaccine trials showed there was light at the end of the "long dark tunnel" of the coronavirus pandemic. But he said the world had to ensure they were distributed fairly across the globe. "Every government rightly wants to do everything it can to protect its people," Tedros told a virtual press conference. The novel coronavirus has killed nearly 1.39 million people and more than 58.6 million cases have been registered since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP. Anticipating the huge demand for any approved vaccine, the WHO has helped create the so-called Covax facility to ensure equitable distribution. Tedros said 187 countries were now on board.

News article:
Israel’s former coronavirus czar has predicted that vaccines being developed for the virus will succeed in stemming the deadly global pandemic, and that by next year the crisis will be over. “The coronavirus crisis will end in 2021,” Gamzu told an Israel Democracy Institute conference Tuesday. “In my opinion, the vaccine will be successful. We will see in the first half of 2021 massive marketing and production of the vaccine, probably not just from one company.” On the first day of the two-day online conference Gamzu — who ended his term leading the country’s campaign against the virus outbreak earlier this month — also touched on a controversial aspect of Israel’s effort against the virus: a cellphone tracking program that the government uses to track COVID-19 contagion, monitoring citizens’ movements so that those who come into contact with carriers could be ordered into quarantine. The program makes use of capabilities of the Shin Beit security agency, and the information it collects is passed on to health officials. “The use of [Shin Bet] tools deprives all the decision-makers of sleep,” Gamzu said, according to a press release from IDI. “Nevertheless, the State of Israel is very careful about privacy. In Israel, the struggle against the pandemic does not infringe on privacy at this stage, and decision-makers do their utmost to reach balance all the time. Everyone is trying to get through this incident with a minimum of invasion of privacy.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The Israel Defense Forces’ Home Front commander, Major General Uri Gordin, said at the same conference that while the military can, and is, helping in the virus efforts, it should not be put in charge of the entire campaign. “The Health Ministry should be in charge of managing the pandemic,” he said. “We can help, and we do a great deal. I do not think we should engage in enforcement missions, I do not think the military should engage in civilian policy; it is not our job. The political echelon should formulate civilian policy and the Health Ministry should formulate health policy. Our job is to assist them.” The IDF is running a large contact tracing operation involving thousands of servicepeople, but some — notably former defense minister and Yamina party leader MK Naftali Bennett — have called for the Defense Ministry to be given overall control of handling the virus. Advertisement Israel has stuck deals for vaccines with pharma companies Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Arcturus, and is in negotiations with other companies developing shots. The country is also in talks with Russia to receive its Sputnik V vaccine, though some experts have questioned its opaque certification process. Israel is expected to acquire doses for 12 million people — enough vaccines for everyone in the country. However, none of the deals guarantee a deadline for the arrival of the vaccines. And though all the companies are in various advanced stages of development and testing, no vaccine has so far been approved for general use by regulators in the US and Europe. Israel is also working on a homegrown vaccine, though it is currently only in phase 1 trials and its development is expected to take months longer than the foreign candidates.

Israel’s former coronavirus czar has predicted that vaccines being developed for the virus will succeed in stemming the deadly global pandemic, and that by next year the crisis will be over. “The coronavirus crisis will end in 2021,” Gamzu told an Israel Democracy Institute conference Tuesday. “In my opinion, the vaccine will be successful. We will see in the first half of 2021 massive marketing and production of the vaccine, probably not just from one company.” On the first day of the two-day online conference Gamzu — who ended his term leading the country’s campaign against the virus outbreak earlier this month — also touched on a controversial aspect of Israel’s effort against the virus: a cellphone tracking program that the government uses to track COVID-19 contagion, monitoring citizens’ movements so that those who come into contact with carriers could be ordered into quarantine. The program makes use of capabilities of the Shin Beit security agency, and the information it collects is passed on to health officials. “The use of [Shin Bet] tools deprives all the decision-makers of sleep,” Gamzu said, according to a press release from IDI. “Nevertheless, the State of Israel is very careful about privacy. In Israel, the struggle against the pandemic does not infringe on privacy at this stage, and decision-makers do their utmost to reach balance all the time. Everyone is trying to get through this incident with a minimum of invasion of privacy.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The Israel Defense Forces’ Home Front commander, Major General Uri Gordin, said at the same conference that while the military can, and is, helping in the virus efforts, it should not be put in charge of the entire campaign. “The Health Ministry should be in charge of managing the pandemic,” he said. “We can help, and we do a great deal. I do not think we should engage in enforcement missions, I do not think the military should engage in civilian policy; it is not our job. The political echelon should formulate civilian policy and the Health Ministry should formulate health policy. Our job is to assist them.” The IDF is running a large contact tracing operation involving thousands of servicepeople, but some — notably former defense minister and Yamina party leader MK Naftali Bennett — have called for the Defense Ministry to be given overall control of handling the virus.

The country is also in talks with Russia to receive its Sputnik V vaccine, though some experts have questioned its opaque certification process. Israel is expected to acquire doses for 12 million people — enough vaccines for everyone in the country. However, none of the deals guarantee a deadline for the arrival of the vaccines. And though all the companies are in various advanced stages of development and testing, no vaccine has so far been approved for general use by regulators in the US and Europe. Israel is also working on a homegrown vaccine, though it is currently only in phase 1 trials and its development is expected to take months longer than the foreign candidates.

Health Ministry data on Wednesday morning showed 1,182 new cases of coronavirus diagnosed in Israel a day earlier. The number of active cases in the country stood at 11,072, the highest figure since October 30. Of those, 266 patients were in serious condition, including 94 on ventilators. A further 67 were in moderate condition and the rest had mild or no symptoms. The number of infections since the pandemic began increased to 338,591. The death toll held steady at 2,877, with no reported overnight fatalities. Testing reached its highest level of the week with 62,734 performed on Tuesday, and1.9 percent coming back positive, a slight drop from recent days. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms On Wednesday morning, Deputy Health Minister Yoav Kisch said that officials were still weighing recommending a national curfew to stem family visits over Hanukkah and Christmas amid the continued rise in new coronavirus infections. “The issue is still under discussion. The Health Ministry is considering the possibility, but it is not an effective step in reducing morbidity,” Kisch told Army Radio. While health officials have previously cast doubt on the efficacy of nightly curfews in curbing the spread of COVID-19, Kisch said on Tuesday in an interview with Channel 12 that there’s a “logic” to such a measure over the holiday to prevent people gathering around nightfall to light Hanukkah candles together. Advertisement It was unclear if the proposal had the backing of health officials or the cabinet, which has final say on any restrictions. Ministers have in the past rejected Health Ministry proposals for some lockdowns and other regulations. On Tuesday, Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, the acting head of the ministry’s public health services division, said that officials were not planning on attempting to impose a lockdown over the winter holidays. “We’re on the verge of restrained steps — right now every sick person is infecting more than one other. It’s possible that limited measures can slow the advance of the disease, and we won’t need significant steps,” she said. Alroy-Preis’s comments were made in a briefing in which she warned Israel was entering a third wave of coronavirus infections, and that rising infection rates would likely climb even further. Alroy-Preis said the infection figures were “very worrying.” “This rise does not include [those caused by] the opening of malls or the return of grades five and six, meaning there will be more rises. This is the start of the third wave,” Alroy-Preis said. Advertisement “This is an emergency,” she said. “We are identifying more and more ‘orange’ cities [with moderate infection rates].” “This is exactly how the second wave started. Many of the sick are coming from red countries — it’s a serious vector,” she added, referring to countries with high infection rates. She said officials are looking into the possibility of reopening isolation hotels for those returning from abroad. Alroy-Preis’s warning joined that of coronavirus czar Nachman Ash, who said earlier Tuesday that Israel was in a “state of emergency” due to climbing infections. Health Ministry Director-General Chezy Levy, however, pushed back against those warnings. “We’re not in an emergency situation at the moment,” Levy told Channel 12. “The rise in morbidity is likely to bring us there, perhaps even in big leaps, but we’re certainly not there yet.” Levy also told the Kan public broadcaster he doesn’t think the government will, or necessarily can, ban travel to Turkey, after reports said the National Security Council was weighing such a move. Alroy-Preis said although the main infection zones were in the Arab community, numbers were high in the general population as well. Advertisement She also advised against relying on a vaccine getting to Israel anytime soon. “We’ll likely need to get through the winter with most Israelis not vaccinated,” she said. The renewed rise in infections comes as the government continues to roll back many of the restrictions that were in place during the second nationwide lockdown, with high school students returning to class on Sunday and some malls allowed to reopen last week.

That, however, will be a tough nut to crack. The last round of direct talks between the two sides took place in 2013, but back then the US, who mediated in those negotiations, failed to achieve a breakthrough. Since then Israel has continued with its expansionist activity in the disputed West Bank, while the Palestinians have stuck to their strategy of inciting the masses against the Jewish state, frustrating many in the liberal circles of Europe and the US, including Biden himself. The cutting of funds and Trump's seemingly one-sided policies have only made the situation worse, with the Palestinians losing their trust in the US as an objective mediator. If elected, Biden will need to address these issues and regain the faith of the Palestinians, and Sztokman is certain that he will be up for the challenge. "He is going to be great for Israel and the region. He is smart and understands the importance of stability and security and will be able to solve a number of pressing issues". Iranian Threat? However, those pressing issues do not stop at the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Biden will also need to face Iran, if he ends up winning the race on 3 November. In 2018, when President Trump abandoned the Iran nuclear deal aimed at reducing Tehran's nuclear facilities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions on the Islamic Republic, Biden was critical of the decision. For him, leaving the agreement was wrong, just as it was immoral to keep imposing sanctions on the Islamic Republic, which has been struggling to cope with health and economic crises caused by the spread of COVID-19. Biden, who acknowledges "the challenges the regime in Iran poses to America's security interests", says he will take a different approach to the issue, finding "a smart way to be tough on Iran". Just as with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, here too Sztokman is certain that the Democratic candidate will do what's best for America, Israel, the region, and the world. "Biden will do the right thing with Iran. Trump's decision to step out [from the deal] in the middle of everything without listening to advisers was wrong. It was spontaneous and impulsive and it reflects the current president's incoherent foreign policy".

News article:
Yoram Ettinger, a former Israeli diplomat and an expert on Israel-US ties, says he definitely understands the reason behind the support from the Jewish state and the Gulf for Trump. "They trust Trump because he has applied military and financial pressure on the Islamic Republic, simultaneously boosting cooperation with moderate Arab states. Democrats, on the other hand, have courted the Ayatollahs and disappointed many in the Gulf". Now, as polls predict a victory for Trump's challenger, Joe Biden, Ettinger says history might repeat itself and the new boss in Washington might return to the policies implemented by the Obama administration. Past Mistakes And the problem is, says the expert, those policies were a mistake that should not be repeated. "First of all, with the eruption of the upheavals in the Middle East in 2011, the Democrats referred to that turbulence as an Arab Spring and a march of democracy without realising that that was a devastating tsunami. And, secondly, they refrained from admitting that Islamic terror was a threat and tackle it as such". Quite the opposite was true. In 2009, for example, loyal to its policy of political correctness, the Obama administration reportedly ordered to erase intelligence on individuals linked to a number of terror groups. And in 2015, when an Islamist extremist opened fire on two military installations in Chattanooga killing five people, Obama called it "workplace violence". "Biden is likely to continue that policy, simply because of the nature of his political advisers and he is also likely to shrink the US defence budget", predicts Ettinger. With Trump in office, the US defence budget has gone up. In 2020 it reached $738 billion, an increase of $21 billion from the previous year. Ettinger says that decision "enhanced the US posture of deterrence in the region and the entire world", whereas a move in the opposite direction would "whet the appetites of rogue regimes". Enemies Won't Rest Although the concept of a boosted budget as a tool of deterrence is still debatable, for a country that faces multiple security threats the importance of a big military budget can hardly be underestimated. In recent years, the US has managed to infuriate a number of regional players. First, in 2018, together with France and the UK, it launched a series of airstrikes in Syria, angering the authorities in Damascus.

News article:
With both US presidential candidates staunch supporters of the State of Israel and close personal friends of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli premier is likely viewing Tuesday’s election without dread for either outcome. While his preference for another Donald Trump victory seems obvious, Netanyahu knows Joe Biden has a good chance of moving into the White House, and is therefore ready to turn the pendulum’s swing into a political victory of his own. If the incumbent president gets four more years, the prime minister is likely to argue that it was their unique relationship that made the Trump administration one of the most pro-Israel in history. “I got Trump to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and to move the US Embassy,” he can be expected to proclaim with increasing frequency as the next election in Israel nears. “It was due to my lobbying that he withdrew from the dangerous Iran nuclear deal. Because of our friendship he recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and declared that West Bank settlements aren’t illegal. And it’s no coincidence that the ‘Deal of Century’ peace proposal sounded like I wrote it myself,” he might say. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Only with Netanyahu in the Prime Minister’s Office can Israel continue to enjoy the fruits of this remarkably tight partnership, his supporters will argue. The trend of Arab countries normalizing ties will only continue if Netanyahu pushes Trump to seek more such peace deals, they will insist. The Iranian threat? It was Netanyahu who got the American president to quit the deal, and it will take Netanyahu to prevent him from negotiating another flawed agreement. And if Biden wins? Then Netanyahu is needed more than ever, his backers will say. Advertisement “It takes an experienced statesman like him to stand up to pressure. Who else could take on an administration hellbent on appeasing Iran and trying to force Israeli concessions on the Palestinian question?” they will ask. The prime minister prides himself on having fended off immense pressure, especially regarding Israel’s West Bank settlement enterprise, from the last Democrat who sat in the Oval Office. The fact that he dared openly confront and even antagonize Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, over the 2015 nuclear deal, shows that only someone of his stature can be trusted to stand up to Biden, Netanyahu and his supporters will doubtlessly argue. To be sure, it will be more difficult to portray Biden as hostile to Israel than it was with Obama. As opposed to the former president, whose detractors often cast doubts over his support for Israel, Biden has a 40-year record of staunch support for the Jewish state. He is said to have once referred to Israel as his “second home.” “We must have no daylight between us,” he told then-Israeli ambassador to Washington Michael Oren before his first visit to Jerusalem as vice president in March 2010. “We’ve been personal friends for almost three decades,” Netanyahu said as he hosted Biden a few days later in his office. “And in all that time you’ve been a real friend to me and a real friend to Israel and to the Jewish people and you’ve come to Israel many times since you came here first on the eve of the Yom Kippur War.” Advertisement But the friendly atmosphere quickly turned sour as local authorities announced a plan to build 1,600 housing units in Ramat Shlomo, a Jerusalem neighborhood east of the Green Line, during the vice president’s stay. The planned settlement expansion “undermines the trust we need right now and runs counter to the constructive discussions that I’ve had here in Israel,” Biden fumed. It was one of many quarrels between the Netanyahu government and the Obama administration. Still, six years and one very contentious nuclear deal later, Biden came to Jerusalem for a second visit as Obama’s deputy, and was welcomed like a good friend. “I want to thank you personally for your, for our personal friendship of over 30 years,” Netanyahu said at their joint press conference. “We’ve known each other a long time. We’ve gone through many trials and tribulations. And we have an enduring bond that represents the enduring bond between our people.” Biden then recalled his first meeting with Netanyahu in the early 1980s. “We met in a parking lot outside of a restaurant where I was meeting with some American Jewish leaders, and we became close friends and I later signed a picture for you that I, as a joke I said ‘Bibi, I don’t agree with a damn thing you say, but I love you.’” On the flipside, Netanyahu’s political opponents argue that it is bad news for US-Israel relations regardless of who wins Tuesday’s election. We don’t want to find ourselves with a Democratic Party in the United States acting like the British Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn Advertisement Another Trump term will irrevocably turn Israel into a partisan issue, they will say, as the US president has claimed that the Democrats are hostile to Israel, trying to drive a wedge between American Jews and the party most of them have traditionally been voting for. And if Biden triumphs? Netanyahu and the former Delaware senator may have known each other for decades, but clashes over Iran and the Palestinians are inevitable regardless of any personal affinity, the prime minister’s critics can be expected to argue, noting that a Biden administration would be more than just the man on the top. Incidentally, Biden’s running mate, California Senator Kamala Harris, is also known as a friend of Israel. But it’s not unreasonable to assume that Biden, in a bid to reunite a divided Democratic party, may appoint some members of its progressive wing to key posts in the administration. Support for Israel was always a bipartisan consensus, but Netanyahu “decided, mostly for internal reasons, to break with that principle,” opposition leader Yair Lapid charged Monday. “Netanyahu created an almost complete identification between the current Israeli government and the Republican Party, between himself and President Trump. He wanted to use President Trump’s justified popularity in Israel to gain some points at home,” Lapid said. The prime minister’s alleged preference of the Republicans is playing into the hands of “radical elements” within the Democratic party, Lapid went on. “He’s pushing the Democrats further and further away. We don’t want to find ourselves with a Democratic Party in the United States acting like the British Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn.” Even if Trump wins, Jerusalem needs the support of Democrats in Congress, where decisions crucial to Israel’s security are being taken, he warned. Still, even Lapid agreed that Israel doesn’t have to fret about the identity of the person who will be inaugurated on January 20. “It’s a tight race but there are things we already know: The next president of the United States will be a friend of Israel. Both Donald Trump and Joe Biden are friends of Israel with a deep commitment to Israel and to Zionism,” he said.

News article:
Just two weeks ago, Joe Biden was the butt of a jibe made by U.S. President Donald Trump during a conversation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter "Do you think 'Sleepy Joe' could have made this deal?" Trump asked Netanyahu in a televised phone call with his closest foreign ally about a Middle East peace initiative. 3 View gallery Benjamin Netanyahu and Joe Biden meeting in 2016 ( Photo: GPO ) Netanyahu demurred, apparently hedging in case of a Biden victory. It was a wise move: Declared winner of the U.S. presidential election by major television networks on Saturday, Biden is the one laughing now. The hawkish prime minister made no immediate comment after the U.S. networks called the election for the former vice president, and footage of Netanyahu and Trump remained at the top of his Facebook page. 3 View gallery Benjamin Netanyahu's Facebook page includes video of the prime minister with Donald Trump ( Photo: Screenshot ) Trump, who has made repeated claims of electoral fraud without providing proof, immediately accused Biden of "rushing to falsely pose as the winner." Still, Justice Minister Avi Nissenkorn - a member of Netanyahu's ruling coalition belonging to the centrist Blue & White party - swiftly congratulated Biden. "Congratulations to US President-elect Joe Biden! Congratulations to Kamala Harris, the first woman to serve as vice president and congratulations to the American people on the worthy democratic process," Nissenkorn said in Hebrew on Twitter. ברכות לנשיא הנבחר של ארה"ב ג'ו ביידן! ברכות לקמלה האריס, האשה הראשונה שתכהן כסגנית הנשיא וברכות לעם האמריקאי על ההליך הדמוקרטי הראוי. אני בטוח שהקשר ההדוק והחזק בין ארה"ב לישראל ישמר ויתחזק תחת ממשל ביידן 🇮🇱🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/38VMYCTWOf — אבי ניסנקורן (@AviNissenkorn) November 7, 2020 Opposition leader Yair Lapid also offered his congratulations to the Democrat on Twitter. "The relationship between our countries is based on deeply held values and critical shared interests which I know will be at the heart of your administration," Lapid wrote. Congratulations to my friend President-Elect @JoeBiden and Vice President-Elect @KamalaHarris. The relationship between our countries is based on deeply held values and critical shared interests which I know will be at the heart of your administration. — יאיר לפיד - Yair Lapid (@yairlapid) November 7, 2020 Though Biden describes himself as a Zionist and friend to nine Israeli prime ministers, friction could arise between a Biden White House and Netanyahu, who famously feuded with Biden's ex-boss, Barack Obama. In what Israel would likely see as a de-facto third Obama term, Biden has pledged to restore U.S. involvement in the Iran nuclear deal and is likely to voice opposition to Israeli settlement of West Bank land where Palestinians seek statehood. 3 View gallery Benjamin Netanyahu and Barack Obama at the White House in 2015 ( Photo: Reuters )

News article:
Kuwait City: Kuwait’s Emir, Sheikh Nawaf Al Ahmed Al Sabah, congratulated the US President-elect, Joe Biden, after news broke on Saturday of his victory. The Emir also congratulated Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris, who is set to become the first woman, first black person and first person of Indian descent to be elected to the position. In the cable, Sheikh Nawaf praised the historic and strong relationship between the US and Kuwait and said that he is looking forward to strengthening relations and joint cooperation in various aspects. The crown prince, Sheikh Mishal Al Ahmed Al Sabah, and the Prime Minister, Sheikh Khaled Al Sabah, also congratulated the US President-elect and Vice-President-elect in two separate cables. Historic relationship The two countries share a long history, of cooperation, mutual benefit and friendship, that began well before Kuwait gained independence. In 1911, by invitation from Sheikh Mubarak Al Sabah, the Reformed Church of America opened a medical centre in Kuwait, known to Kuwaitis as the American Hospital, or Al Americani. Then around 20 years later, with the discovery of oil, Kuwait formed a joint venture with the American Gulf Oil company in 1933. Ten years before Kuwait gained independence, the US government began fostering its relationship with Kuwait as it set up a US consulate. Then in 1961, the US government established diplomatic relations with Kuwait and upgraded the consulate to an Embassy. Since the 1980s, much of the relationship has been one of security and stability, as both parties have benefited from one another. With around 13,000 US military personnel stationed across the country, the number of troops in Kuwait make up one-third of the total US forces deployed in the region, including Iraq and Afghanistan. When Iran began attacking Gulf shipping tankers, mainly Kuwaiti vessels, in 1986, the US and the Soviet Union were invited by Kuwait to ensure the security of its tankers. Then during the 1991 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the US spearheaded a coalition of 34 countries that launched an aerial campaign against the Iraqis. Following 1991 liberation, the US increased its military presence in Kuwait, to ensure its interest in the region as well as curb a future Iraqi attack.

News article:
AMMAN: Palestinian leaders watching the results of the US elections say they are hoping for a re-engagement with Washington after years of squandered efforts by the Trump administration in the quest for peace. Senior Palestinian officials were asked during the crucial days after the poll to stay quiet in order to avoid provoking the US president, who will stay in power until Jan. 20. Vera Baboun, former Bethlehem mayor and a member of the Palestinian National Council, told Arab News that Palestinians are looking forward to the US government acknowledging their cause. “We hope that President-elect Joe Biden will respond positively to the call by President (Mahmoud) Abbas for an international conference for peace early in 2021.” Baboun said that diplomatic contacts must be renewed at a high level quickly so the upcoming conference can have substantive discussions. Kamala Harris, Biden’s deputy and running mate, has said that a Biden administration is committed to a two-state solution and will renew contacts with the Palestinian leadership, including reopening the Palestinian mission in Washington and the US mission in East Jerusalem. She also said that the US will restore financial support to the United Nations Refugee Agency and other humanitarian programs supporting the Palestinian people. Wadie Abunassar, director of the Haifa-based International Center for Consultations, told Arab News that Biden will certainly help restart Israeli-Palestinian talks, but won’t necessarily bring Palestinians an independent state. “It is difficult seeing Biden granting high priority to the Israeli-Palestinian track, especially with current Israeli and Palestinian leaders (Netanyahu and Abbas) around.” But Abunassar believes that Biden will make serious efforts “to maintain good ties with Israel and will avoid pressing it too much, especially in the absence of any serious Muslim or Arab pressure on him to grant Palestinians the right to self-determination.” However, former Palestinian government spokesman Jamal Dajani warned that Biden is unlikely to be the savior of Palestinians. “I am not sure if Biden as president will be able to undo the damage done by Trump,” Dajani said before calling on the Palestinian leadership to “stop banking on the US.” While Palestinian leaders refuse to link the renewal of contacts with Washington to the resumption of security ties with Israel, a number of Palestinians contacted by Arab News said that they are hoping that the departure of Trump and the election of a friendlier Biden administration might help resolve the current impasse with Israel. Of extreme interest to many Palestinians is the resolution of the tax revenue conflict that has resulted in the deprivation of money earmarked for Palestinians that has been held by Israel.

News article:
JERUSALEM: Joe Biden’s US election win marks a setback for Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu, a staunch ally of President Donald Trump—but it could spur renewed engagement between Washington and the Palestinians, experts said. Netanyahu said Trump was Israel’s strongest-ever ally in the White House, and the Republican advanced policies that delighted the Israeli prime minister’s right-wing base. Netanyahu congratulated Biden and vice president-elect Kamala Harris on Twitter Sunday, before thanking Trump for a raft of moves that, according to Netanyahu, advanced Israel’s interests. Trump unilaterally pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal—an agreement between Tehran and world powers loathed by Netanyahu—and recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s “undivided capital”, moving the US embassy to the city, breaking international consensus. He also endorsed Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights—which was seized from Syria—and avoided criticising Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. According to a pre-vote poll by the Israel Democracy Institute think-tank, 63 per cent of Israelis wanted Trump to win a second term. After the US result was announced, 28-year-old Israeli truck driver Shmuel Nemirovski told AFP that even though “Trump would have been better”, he was comfortable with Biden because the president-elect does not appear “to have anything against Israel”. In fact, Biden’s ties with Israel run deep, and he has been a vocal supporter of the Jewish state for decades. He visited Israel in 1973, months after he was first elected to the Senate. In a 2015 speech, while serving as Barack Obama’s vice president, Biden said the United States was wedded to a “sacred promise to protect the homeland of the Jewish people”. During the 2012 vice-presidential debate, when Biden was facing criticism over the Obama administration’s treatment of Israel from Republican Paul Ryan, Biden asserted that he and Netanyahu had “been friends for 39 years”. Netanyahu on Sunday praised Biden as “a great friend of Israel” with whom he has had “a long and warm personal relationship”. Biden supported recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital two decades before Trump triggered global outcry by doing so. Biden backed a 1995 Senate bill to establish a US embassy in Jerusalem by 1999. Biden’s 2020 campaign said he would not reverse Trump’s embassy move, but would reopen a consulate in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem “to engage the Palestinians”. But Biden is expected to walk-back parts of Trump’s record, notably by opposing Jewish settlement construction in the occupied West Bank, which the president-elect has described as an obstacle to peace. Biden also said he would restore “humanitarian aid for the Palestinian people,” after Trump cut US support to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). Israel’s former envoy to Washington Michael Oren told AFP that tensions will spike if Biden seeks to revive the Iran nuclear deal, a prospect he said had a “very high” likelihood. Experts have said that the normalisation deals, as well as warming ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia under Trump, were partly driven by a desire to forge a united front against Iran. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, tipped for a possible cabinet post, has called Netanyahu a “reactionary racist”. Israel has meanwhile accused two Democratic congresswomen, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, of supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians. The Palestinian Authority cut ties with Trump’s administration, accusing it of being flagrantly pro-Israel. In a statement congratulating Biden and Harris, Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas urged the incoming administration “to enhance the Palestinian-American relations”. Abbas said he wanted to work with the new administration “to achieve freedom, independence, justice and dignity for (the Palestinian) people”. Experts agree that while a renewed Middle East peace push is unlikely to top Biden’s immediate agenda, his administration will seek to restore America’s traditional role as a broker in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Asharq Al-Awsat UN chief Antonio Guterres congratulates US President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, a UN spokesman said on Monday, describing US partnership with the world body as an “essential pillar” of global cooperation. Biden will succeed President Donald Trump, who has been critical of the 193-member United Nations and wary of the value of multilateralism during his four years in office. Guterres took up his role just a few weeks before Trump in 2017. Guterres “reaffirms that the partnership between the United States and the United Nations is an essential pillar of the international cooperation needed to address the dramatic challenges facing the world today,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters. Since taking office, Trump has quit the UN Human Rights Council, the World Health Organization, the UN cultural agency UNESCO, a global accord to tackle climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. The Trump administration cut funding for the UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA). Biden, who was vice president under Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama, has pledged to rescind Trump’s decision to abandon the WHO and quickly rejoin the Paris climate accord, a signature achievement of the Obama-Biden administration. Biden has also said he will rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, also negotiated under the Obama administration, if Tehran also returns to compliance. On the election of Harris, who will become the first female US vice president, Dujarric said Guterres “is always pleased when a woman leader breaks yet another ceiling.”

News article:
LONDON — Sighs of relief rippled through capitals of longtime U.S. allies around the world after Joe Biden became president-elect on Saturday. Many leaders have been battered by four years of the convention-smashing President Donald Trump and see in Biden a counterpart who will try and return America onto a path of multilateralism and international cooperation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who had a fraught relationship with Trump, was among the first world leaders to issue a statement congratulating Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris. "Our two countries are close friends, partners, and allies. We share a relationship that's unique on the world stage," Trudeau wrote soon after news emerged that Biden had won the pivotal state of Pennsylvania, according to NBC News projections. "I'm really looking forward to working together and building on that with you both." Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo was less diplomatic. "Welcome back America!" she wrote on Twitter. "Congratulations to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for their election!" Messages from foreign leadersand officials are common when a new U.S. president is elected. Less common, however, is the number this time around who have been referring to the previous administration — perhaps tacitly signposting their relief that it's over — when delivering their congratulations. There were many mentions of the challenges the new White House faced. Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven congratulated Biden and mentioned the need for "multilateralism" — something the Trump administration has explicitly shunned. My warmest congratulations to @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. Looking forward to strengthening excellent US-Swedish relations and to work jointly for multilateralism, democracy and global security. Together, we can lead a green transition creating jobs for the future. — SwedishPM (@SwedishPM) November 7, 2020 New Zealand Prime Minster Jacinda Ardern — lauded for her response to the coronavirus pandemic and the March 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks that killed 51 people — celebrated Biden's victory before saying there were "so many issues facing the international community." French President Emmanuel Macron also noted the international challenges piling up on the president-elect's desk. The Americans have chosen their President. Congratulations @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris! We have a lot to do to overcome today’s challenges. Let's work together! — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) November 7, 2020 The rush of congratulations from many Europeans made sense given Biden's long track record as a supporter of strong trans-Atlantic ties. "Biden will be more diplomatic toward allies across the board, but particularly toward Europeans," Hans Kundnani, a senior research fellow focusing on Europe and trans-Atlantic relations at the U.K.-based think tank Chatham House, said before the election. "Europeans will be extremely relieved." German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom Trump has publicly criticized, congratulated Biden after he was named president-elect Saturday. On Monday, she spoke warmly of the former vice president in a speech. "I sincerely congratulate Joe Biden to his election as the 46th President of the United States of America. Joe Biden brings the experience of decades in domestic and foreign policy with him. He knows Germany and Europe well. I fondly remember meetings and conversations with him," she said. Germany's foreign minister, Heiko Maas, welcomed the "clear figures" that propelled Biden to victory. German Chancellor Angela Merkel speaks with Vice President Joe Biden in Berlin in 2013. Steffen Kugler-Bundesregierung / Getty Images file Relations with the European Union, NATO and, in particular, Germany were strained under Trump. "I know Joe Biden as a strong supporter of our alliance," NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg wrote. "A strong NATO is good for both North America and Europe." Minutes after NBC News and others projected Biden's victory, Ireland's prime minister, Micheál Martin, offered his congratulations via Twitter. Biden is one of the 30 million Americans who identify as Irish — his great-great grandfather emigrated from County Mayo to the U.S. in 1850. On the campaign trail Biden warned the United Kingdom not to allow Brexit to risk the safety of the Good Friday Agreement, a 1998 peace deal between rival Irish factions that put an end to the sectarian conflict known as the Troubles. I want to congratulate the new President Elect of the USA @JoeBiden Joe Biden has been a true friend of this nation throughout his life and I look forward to working with him in the years ahead. I also look forward to welcoming him back home when the circumstances allow! 🇮🇪 🇺🇸 — Micheál Martin (@MichealMartinTD) November 7, 2020 To that end, while U.K. Prime Minister 's Boris Johnson also quickly issued a congratulatory message, referring to the U.S. as Britain's "most important ally," his message was not as enthusiastic as those of some of his counterparts. Biden has spoken against Britain's exit from Europe, a cause championed by Johnson, and in December he referred to Johnson as the "physical and emotional clone" of Trump, according to The Hill. On the other side of the globe, Australia, an important U.S. ally and a partner in managing its relations with China, welcomed Biden's win. "I particularly look forward to this with President-elect Biden because he comes to this relationship with a deep experience and a deep history," Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters Sunday. Elsewhere, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi focused on vice-president-elect Kamala Harris, who is of South Asian American descent. He called Harris’ success “pathbreaking” and “a matter of immense pride” for all Indian-Americans. However, not everyone may be overjoyed at the prospect of a Biden presidency. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics A sense of unease is likely coursing through parts of the Middle East, where Trump's White House has had especially close relationships with the leaders of longtime U.S. partners Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Israel and Egypt. "They are going to try to coexist with Biden and make the best of a bad situation from their point of view," said Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. "They put most of their eggs in Trump's basket — he's been good to them." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayhu, one of Trump’s closest international allies, took until Sunday to tweet his congratulations to Biden, calling the president-elect “a great friend of Israel.” But he also thanked Trump for “the friendship you have shown the state of Israel and me personally” as well as for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and standing up to Iran. Trump is very popular in Israel, where 71 percent of people expressed confidence in him to do the right thing regarding world affairs in a 2019 Pew Research Center poll. However, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement Sunday he hoped to work with Biden to strengthen the Palestinian-American relations. Palestinians have been holding out for a change of U.S. president for three years after being largely ostracized by Trump. Iran's president Hassan Rouhani called on Biden to "compensate for past mistakes" and return the U.S. to Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, a state-run news agency reported Sunday. The Trump administration withdrew the U.S. from the deal and placed crippling sanctions on the country. Meanwhile, though Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow will work with any U.S. leader, Biden's win will be perceived as a net negative for Russia, Vladimir Frolov, a Moscow-based political analyst, said before the election. There has been no official comment from Russia about Biden's win. But opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, who was recently poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent, congratulated Biden and Americans for “defining the new leadership in a free and fair election,” something he called “a privilege which is not available to all countries.” Biden called Russia the biggest threat to U.S. national security last month — an assessment the Kremlin said encouraged hatred of Russia. "Moscow is paying close attention to this and does not like what it sees," Frolov said. China, which has been in a bitter dispute with Trump over trade, technology, Hong Kong, Beijing's handling of the pandemic and many other issues, have remained quiet on Biden’s win so far. Meanwhile Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, welcomed Biden's victory and said he looked forward to working with the new administration. Trump took the unprecedented step in May of pulling the U.S. out of the WHO — a decision Biden promised to reverse "on day one" if elected. Tedros said in a speech Monday that since Trump signaled he would pull out of the 2015 Paris Accord on climate change, "the creeping guidance of nationalism and isolationism have eroded our sense of common purpose" in scientific progress. "In that spirit, we congratulate president elect Joe Biden and VP elect Kamala Harris and we look forward to working with this administration very closely," he said.

LONDON — Sighs of relief rippled through capitals of longtime U.S. allies around the world after Joe Biden became president-elect on Saturday. Many leaders have been battered by four years of the convention-smashing President Donald Trump and see in Biden a counterpart who will try and return America onto a path of multilateralism and international cooperation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who had a fraught relationship with Trump, was among the first world leaders to issue a statement congratulating Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris. "Our two countries are close friends, partners, and allies. We share a relationship that's unique on the world stage," Trudeau wrote soon after news emerged that Biden had won the pivotal state of Pennsylvania, according to NBC News projections. "I'm really looking forward to working together and building on that with you both." Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo was less diplomatic. "Welcome back America!" she wrote on Twitter. "Congratulations to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for their election!" Messages from foreign leadersand officials are common when a new U.S. president is elected.

News article:
It’s risky to predict how any new president might interact with Israel. Will President-elect Joe Biden follow in the footsteps of Barak Obama, his revered leader under whom Biden served as vice president? That is a question of consequence for Israel since Obama easily qualifies as the least friendly president to Israel since its Proclamation of Independence on May 14, 1948. That evening, just 11 minutes after David Ben-Gurion, Israeli founding father and its first prime minister, declared independence, U.S. President Harry S. Truman recognized the first Jewish state in more than two millennia. That set the presidential standard for an official American embrace of Israel. Liberal Jews may cringe at the reality that the president who has followed most closely in Truman’s footsteps is Donald Trump. Under his administration, Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights was recognized and the U.S. embassy was relocated from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, implicitly reaffirming the ancient Jewish holy city as Israel’s capital. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in his forthcoming trip to Israel, may visit the settlement of Psagot, near Ramallah. If he does, he will be the first top American official to have set foot in an Israeli settlement. in fact, it would not be surprising if Trump, in a farewell gift, recognizes Israeli sovereignty over the settlements, home to 430,000 Israelis living in their biblical homeland. But what about Biden and Israel? Will he embrace or reject the palpable hostility of Obama, his political idol? Clearly, Israelis are not optimistic. Anticipating the recent election, they favored Trump over Biden by a 2:1 majority. History is on their side. Biden has frequently retold the story of his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir in 1973. Showing him maps of the region, she described Israel’s precarious position. Noting his discomfort, she reassured him that Israelis had a secret weapon against hostile Arab states: They had nowhere else to go. Nearly a decade later, Prime Minister Menachem Begin met with senators at the U.S. Capitol. Biden advised him that the expansion of settlements would endanger American support for aid to Israel. Begin sharply responded: “Don’t threaten us with slashing aid. Do you think that because the U.S. lends us money it is entitled to impose on us what we must do,” adding: “I am a proud Jew. Three thousand years of culture are behind me, and you will not frighten me with threats.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Biden backed off, over time showing signs of warming towards Israel. At the 2013 AIPAC Policy Conference, he dated his affection towards Israel from when he first heard the phrase “Never Again.” It taught him that “the only way to ensure that it could never happen again was the establishment and the existence of a secure, Jewish state of Israel.” But Biden continued to waffle, especially as Obama’s loyal vice president. At an Israeli Independence Day celebration in 2015, he promised that “if you were attacked and overwhelmed, we would fight for you.” But Obama’s support for a settlement freeze and a two-state solution based on pre-1967 lines, with a state of Palestine occupying biblical Judea and Samaria, commanded Biden’s approval. In the waning days of the Obama administration, Biden promoted U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334 declaring that settlements in “occupied Palestinian territory” are illegal. In a 2016 speech to left-wing J Street, he condemned “the steady and systematic expansion of settlements, the legalization of outposts, land seizures that are moving us toward a one-state reality, and that reality is dangerous.” Biden declared: “We have an overwhelming obligation … to push [Israelis] as hard as we can toward what they know in their gut is the only ultimate solution—a two-state solution.” He ignored decades of unrelenting Palestinian obduracy to that solution. Although Joe Biden has often touted himself as a “friend” of Israel, it has been, at best, an ambivalent friendship. He has promised to reverse the Trump administration’s “destructive cut-off of diplomatic ties with the Palestinian Authority,” while promising to reaffirm the demand of the Obama/Biden administration that Israel prohibit Jews from asserting their right to build homes in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank). Biden has also promised to reopen the PLO office in Washington closed by Trump and reinstate funding to the Palestinian Authority that Trump ended because it would not halt payments to terrorists. In his waning days in office, Trump may yet have a farewell gift for Israel: recognition of its sovereignty over Jewish settlements. If delivered, it will be revealing to see whether President Biden resolves his ambivalent relationship with Israel. Will he embrace Barack Obama’s hostility or Donald Trump’s generosity? Time will tell. Jerold S. Auerbach is the author of “Print to Fit: The New York Times, Zionism and Israel 1896-2016,” which was recently selected for Mosaic by Ruth Wisse and Martin Kramer as a “Best Book” for 2019.

By Ron Kampeas November 18, 2020 (JTA) — President-elect Joe Biden assured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a phone call Tuesday that the ties between their countries would remain strong. “The president-elect noted that he expects to work closely with the prime minister to address the many challenges confronting our countries,” Biden’s transition team said in a statement following the call. “The president-elect expressed his determination to ensure that the U.S.-Israel relationship is strengthened and enjoys strong bipartisan support.” Netanyahu’s office put out a similarly worded statement on Twitter. “Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke this evening with US President-elect @JoeBiden,” the tweet said. “In a warm conversation, the President-elect reiterated his deep commitment to the State of Israel and its security.” Biden’s conversation with Netanyahu and a separate one the same day with President Reuven Rivlin consolidated international recognition that Biden is the next U.S. president, contrary to President Donald Trump’s continued insistence that he won the Nov. 3 election despite all evidence to the contrary. Netanyahu, one of Trump’s closest allies, had previously congratulated Biden, but the tweet Tuesday was the first time he referred to Biden as “president-elect” — a title for the former vice president that Trump adamantly rejects. All but a handful of foreign leaders have already called Biden the president-elect. The statements also were significant because Biden appeared to be going out of his way following the election to reassure Netanyahu that the relationship would remain close. Some Democrats, including a number of Biden’s rivals during the primaries, have called for distancing from Netanyahu’s government as it drifts to the right, at one point considering annexation of parts of the West Bank. Netanyahu particularly would want reassurance that Biden would continue Trump’s policy of confronting Iran — one of the “challenges” Biden alluded to in his statement. In both statements describing the calls with Netanyahu and Rivlin, Biden also emphasized his support for “Israel’s security and its future as a Jewish and democratic state,” a reference to Biden’s oft-stated support for a two-state outcome and his opposition to any further Israeli encroachment on areas claimed by Palestinians.

News article:
President-elect Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday, making him the latest world leader to acknowledge, after a slight delay, Biden's win in the 2020 presidential race. President Donald Trump, who's been politically aligned with Netanyahu during his four years in office, continues to refuse to concede to the Democratic ex-vice president. The leaders of Russia, Brazil and Mexico have yet to offer congratulations to Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Tuesday he had spoken with Joe Biden. Netanyahu, who's been politically aligned with President Donald Trump, congratulated Biden 12 hours after the race was called and hasn't referred to him as president-elect President-elect Joe Biden has been taking calls with world leaders since the presidential race was called in his favor. President Donald Trump, however, refuses to concede. Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday Netanyahu's office confirmed the call, according to Reuters, saying the two leaders had a 'warm conversation.' 'The two agreed to meet soon to discuss the many issues that are pending and reaffirmed the need to continue to strengthen the strong alliance between the United States and Israel,' the statement said. Biden also spoke with Israel's President Reuven Rivlin, the Biden-Harris transition team said. 'The president-elect thanked the prime minister for his congratulations and reiterated his steadfast support for Israel’s security and its future as a Jewish and democratic state,' a readout from Biden's team said later Tuesday. Biden also said he was determined that the U.S.-Israel relationship 'enjoys strong bi-partisan support.' The chat comes one day after Netanyahu, in a slip, called Biden the president. 'I have been told that in the near future I will talk with the president ...,' the prime minister said during a Hebrew press conference, according to the Times of Israel. 'Errr, with Joe Biden, who is supposed to be appointed the next president.' Netanyahu wouldn't give his thoughts on Trump's unfounded claims that the election was 'rigged,' thanks to widespread voter fraud. As of Monday, Trump was continuing to tweet that he had 'won' the election - despite a large deficit in both popular and Electoral College votes. 'We have enough politics over here,' Netanyahu said when asked about Trump's claims. Netanyahu waited 12 hours after the race was called for Biden to put out a congratulatory tweet. 'Congratulations Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,' he wrote. 'Joe, we’ve had a long & warm personal relationship for nearly 40 years, and I know you as a great friend of Israel. I look forward to working with both of you to further strengthen the special alliance between the U.S. and Israel.' Until his slip-up Monday, Netanyahu hasn't referred to Biden was the 'president-elect,' in a move that's likely because he fears upsetting Trump, who has backed pro-Israel policies like moving the U.S. embassy Jerusalem, which thrilled Israelis while infuriating Palestinians. Trump remains in office until January 20, 2021. Netanyahu follows the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Italy in touching base with Biden, whose transition has been hobbled by the Trump administration, which is refusing to allow him to tap into federal funds. The Biden transition team said that beyond talking to the two Israeli leaders Tuesday, the president-elect also spoke with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Modi, like Netanyahu, had a very friendly relationship with Trump. Trump traveled to India in late February, his last foreign trip before the coronavirus crisis took hold. Modi was in the U.S. in February 2019 for a 'Howdy Modi' event in Houston, Texas. Biden also spoke with President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and President Sebastián Piñera of Chile, the transition team said Tuesday. Biden, who will be the U.S.'s second Catholic president, also spoke with Pope Francis last week.

President Reuven Rivlin on Thursday urged US President-elect Joe Biden to strive to “build confidence” between Israelis and Palestinians in the interest of peace. Rivlin spoke with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a US think tank, in his first interview since the US presidential election. The group bestowed on Rivlin its highest honor, the Scholar-Statesman Award, during the virtual event. During the lengthy conversation, the institute’s director, Robert Satloff, asked Rivlin if he had a message for Biden. Rivlin first highlighted Israel’s bipartisan ties to the US, in a tacit acknowledgment of US President Donald Trump’s divisive tenure at the White House. “We know that the friendship between the Americans and the Israelis goes beyond politics,” Rivlin said in the English-language discussion.

On the issue of the Palestinians, Rivlin said, “We know that from time to time we have some differences of opinion, also with the American administration, about the actual understanding what is the meaning of two states for two people.” Advertisement “We have to find a way in order to understand — we are not doomed to live together, it is our destiny, we are destined to live together,” Rivlin said. “We can say two states for two people, one state for all the people, federation, confederation, we can do a lot – but first of all we have to build confidence.” “I really believe that to build confidence, you have to show the people, the other people that you respect them, that you really want to live with them,” Rivlin said. “I tried even to really, to convince President Trump that confidence, building confidence, you cannot get it by making a deal. You have to have confidence with somebody. He understood, he wanted to learn more, but we have no one [who] understands it in the region,” Rivlin said. He said Trump “did a lot for the people of Israel,” highlighting his decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem, which was widely supported by the Israeli public and leadership. Besides the embassy move, Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, quit the Iran nuclear deal, declared that settlements are not illegal and endorsed, in principle, an Israeli annexation of parts of the West Bank. The Trump administration also brokered historic normalization deals between Israel and three Arab states — the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan. Trump alienated the Palestinians with his pro-Israel moves during his time in office, however, leading to a complete breakdown in relations between Washington and Ramallah following the embassy move in 2017. Advertisement The Palestinian Authority also cut ties with Israel for six months, before announcing the renewal of security and civil cooperation on Tuesday, following Biden’s victory. The Palestinians expect the incoming administration to be more amenable to their positions. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas lauded Biden’s election victory, urging the incoming administration to “strengthen the Palestinian-American relationship” and so strive for Middle East “peace, stability and security.” Biden is widely seen as a genuine friend to the Jewish state, with close ties to Israeli leaders going back decades. He has known every Israeli prime minister since Golda Meir, and has a long and personal relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, unlike former US president Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president. Obama had a notoriously rancorous relationship with the premier and was unpopular with the Israeli public due to his perceived slights to the Jewish state and the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Biden has for decades been a vocal opponent of settlement expansion and will likely make his views on the matter known fairly soon after Inauguration Day. He has also pledged to return to negotiations with Iran after taking office. Rivlin and Netanyahu spoke to Biden on Tuesday, congratulating him on his election victory in two separate phone calls.

News article:
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden announced a number of cabinet and national security picks on Monday that offers a view into the direction his administration will pursue regarding foreign policy. For the Jewish and pro-Israel community, most of the selections by Biden are familiar names who have long-served in senior foreign-policy positions in previous Democratic administrations, while others are newer names to the American public. Tony Blinken, who served as Biden’s top foreign-policy adviser during his campaign, and was deputy secretary of state and deputy national security advisor under former U.S. President Barack Obama, will be nominated as U.S. secretary of state. A GOP-controlled Senate would likely be receptive to Blinken; whether that comes to fruition will be decided after the two Senate-seat runoffs in Georgia on Jan. 5. Blinken said during the campaign that a Biden administration would keep some of the U.S. sanctions on Iran and reiterated Biden’s stance that the United States would not return to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal unless the Islamic Regime returned to compliance. Jake Sullivan, who also served as a foreign-policy adviser on Biden’s campaign and succeeded Blinken as national security advisor to Biden when he was vice president, has been named as incoming U.S. national security advisor—a position that does not involve Senate confirmation. Sullivan reportedly met with Iranian officials in 2013 in order to foster a possible nuclear agreement with the regime. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a 35-year diplomat, will be nominated as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Avril Haines, who served as deputy national security advisor and deputy CIA director under Obama, will be nominated as director of national intelligence. If confirmed, she would be the first woman to serve in the role, which oversees all U.S. intelligence agencies. Haines was a signee of a letter to the Democratic National Committee that called for the party’s platform to include language critical of Israel, expressed sympathy with the Palestinians and advocated for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Alejandro Mayorkas, who served as U.S. deputy homeland security director and director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, will be nominated as U.S. homeland security secretary. If confirmed, he would be the first Latino and immigrant, and second Jewish person, to lead the agency. John Kerry, who served as secretary of state under Obama after serving for almost three decades as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, will be the special presidential envoy for climate and sit on the National Security Council. While Thomas-Greenfield is no stranger to the foreign-policy arena, she has no experience on issues pertaining to the Middle East or the Jewish community, as her career focused on African affairs. She was U.S. ambassador to Liberia from 2008 to 2012, director-general of the U.S. Foreign Service, and U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs. Nonetheless, a U.S. State Department official who works in African affairs and has worked with Thomas-Greenfield, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the official’s employment and not being authorized to speak to the press, told JNS that “she’s great and had a well-deserved wonderful reputation” at the department, and “knows the ins and outs of the department and is amazing to work with.” Additionally, Thomas-Greenfield met Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, in 2011 during the African Union Summit in the capital of Equatorial Guinea, Malabo. The unscheduled meeting happened after Hoenlein, who was part of a delegation not affiliated with the Conference of Presidents, voluntarily walked out of the plenary session after Iran, joined by the Palestinians, objected to Hoenlein being in the room. Thomas-Greenfield had already been excluded from the session. She approached Hoenlein and his delegation, and the parties discussed the Iranian threat and other issues. Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told JNS that the national security team will reflect how the Biden administration will contrast itself from the current Trump administration. “Regardless of what happens abroad, this is going to be nothing short of a transformation,” he said. Miller remarked that the national interest “will be the object of this group’s attention rather than catering to the needs of a single man’s vanity, politics or personal interests,” referring to the varying picks of U.S. President Donald Trump. He said that Biden’s national security team will “for sure” continue the success of the Abraham Accords, though the Iranian issue will be “very complicated” for them. ‘Sympathetic to concerns about anti-Semitism’ Jewish Democratic Council of America executive director Halie Soifer tweeted that Thomas-Greenfield “will help restore America’s alliances & credibility at the [United Nations], which are critical to our national security & building back better.” Hoenlein, speaking for himself, applauded the choice of Blinken and Sullivan, noting that even where there were differences with them and the umbrella Jewish organization, “we were able to work with them.” “Both are very knowledgeable, experienced,” said Hoenlein, adding that Mayorkas is someone “very sympathetic to the concerns about anti-Semitism” and other concerns from the Jewish community. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates Barbara Leaf told JNS that Blinken and Thomas-Greenfield as the first State nominees are “welcome on several levels: Both bring deep foreign-policy experience and expertise to their positions and have led within the department on both policy and the spectrum of personnel and resources issues.” As to whether Kerry will have any influence on Iran policy, considering that he negotiated the 2015 Iran nuclear as secretary of state, Leaf said, “I think John Kerry is being brought on to do climate, period—something he is passionate about. Two of his big trips in his final year as secretary of state were to the Arctic Circle and to Antarctica to witness and draw attention to the effects of climate change.” She noted that “Biden has a thicket of people on the campaign foreign-policy team to choose from who are steeped in Iran who are likely to populate the administration,” and while Kerry “will offer his views” to Biden, the president-elect “will put together a formal Team Iran to run the policy under Blinken and Sullivan.” Michael Makovsky, president and CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), told JNS, “Given the approach of the Obama administration and the foreign-policy rhetoric during the Democratic primary, Blinken and Sullivan are certainly from the more moderate wing of the party, and that is reassuring. They’re also thoughtful and experienced experts.” “However,” he continued, “they were involved in negotiating the Iran nuclear deal and favor re-entering it. That will be a complicated effort, and one that would be disastrous to achieve, so it is best to withhold judgment until we see how they choose to proceed.” Regarding Haines, Leaf called her “one of the smartest, nimblest managers and navigators of the U.S. interagency” she has worked with and someone who “brings terrific expertise to the job—in intelligence, counter-terrorism and on a mix of key geopolitical issues.” If confirmed, Mayorkas will be in charge of the department that, through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, manages the Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP), which Jewish synagogues and other institutions have relied upon especially in the aftermath of synagogue shootings and other anti-Semitic attacks over the past few years. While the Orthodox Union declined to comment on the picks, Nathan Diament, the organization’s executive director for public policy, told Jewish Insider in November that Mayorkas “was a very good partner in the leadership of DHS.” Aviva Klompas, who was the director of speechwriting for Israel’s U.N. mission under then-Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Ron Prosor, expressed hope that the upcoming Biden administration will continue the Trump administration’s policies of brokering normalization deals between Israel and other countries and on the Iranian threat. “We find ourselves at a promising historic juncture in the Middle East in which relations between Israel and the Muslim world are blossoming,” she told JNS. “I have no doubt that the Biden administration appointees will want to bring more countries to the table to sign peace agreements and bring greater stability to the Middle East for the simple reason that doing so is beneficial to the region and to the United States.” “At the same time,” continued Klompas, “I hope they will listen to the many voices in the Middle East cautioning that Iran remains the primary impediment to peace and stability and should be managed accordingly.” ‘Meaningful leadership and partnership in the search for solutions’ Democratic Majority for Israel president and CEO Mark Mellman told JNS, “President-elect Biden is assembling a national security and foreign policy team with broad knowledge, deep experience, and a strong commitment to the U.S.-Israel relationship. Together with the president-elect, these experienced, crisis-tested professionals will begin to restore America’s world leadership.” The American Jewish Committee applauded Biden for announcing Blinken as his choice to lead Foggy Bottom. “Tony Blinken has the breadth and depth of experience to ably oversee the implementation of U.S. foreign policy under President Biden,” said AJC CEO David Harris, who has met with Blinken on numerous occasions in the latter’s various posts. “He is intimately familiar with the full scope of the president-elect’s foreign-policy views, as well the issues of utmost concern to the Jewish community, including full-throated support for the U.S.-Israel relationship, widening the growing circle of Arab-Israel peace, the fight against global anti-Semitism, and the danger posed by Iran and its proxies.” AJC also praised the appointment of Kerry to the climate role, with the organization telling JNS that “as the first national Jewish organization to have a LEED-certified building, we are delighted to see this new position filled by someone we know well and have hosted several times at our Global Forum.” In a Twitter post, Harris also lauded Thomas-Greenfield. In a Twitter thread, J Street president Jeremy Ben-Ami applauded Monday’s developments. “The National Security team announced today by President-elect Biden represents exactly the type of leadership this country deserves and the world needs after four years of diplomatic and national security malpractice,” he tweeted. “The challenges facing us globally in the 21st century, as well as in the Middle East more specifically, require not just America’s re-engagement but our meaningful leadership and partnership in the search for solutions.” The challenges facing us globally in the 21st century, as well as in the Middle East more specifically, require not just America’s re-engagement but our meaningful leadership and partnership in the search for solutions. — Jeremy Ben-Ami (@JeremyBenAmi) November 23, 2020 B’nai B’rith International provided a neutral stance on Biden’s selections of Blinken, Sullivan and Thomas-Greenfield, though declined to comment on Kerry, Haines and Mayorkas. “We hope the new appointments at State, the NSC and the U.N. will encourage an expansion of Israel’s relations with Arab countries and that they will take a tough line on Iran’s nuclear program and its malign behavior in the region, and will continue a long tradition of fighting bias against Israel at the United Nations,” the organization’s CEO, Daniel Mariaschin, told JNS. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee declined to comment, citing its longstanding policy of not discussing administration nominations and appointments.

Two of his big trips in his final year as secretary of state were to the Arctic Circle and to Antarctica to witness and draw attention to the effects of climate change.” She noted that “Biden has a thicket of people on the campaign foreign-policy team to choose from who are steeped in Iran who are likely to populate the administration,” and while Kerry “will offer his views” to Biden, the president-elect “will put together a formal Team Iran to run the policy under Blinken and Sullivan.” Michael Makovsky, president and CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), told JNS, “Given the approach of the Obama administration and the foreign-policy rhetoric during the Democratic primary, Blinken and Sullivan are certainly from the more moderate wing of the party, and that is reassuring. They’re also thoughtful and experienced experts.” “However,” he continued, “they were involved in negotiating the Iran nuclear deal and favor re-entering it. That will be a complicated effort, and one that would be disastrous to achieve, so it is best to withhold judgment until we see how they choose to proceed.” Regarding Haines, Leaf called her “one of the smartest, nimblest managers and navigators of the U.S. interagency” she has worked with and someone who “brings terrific expertise to the job—in intelligence, counter-terrorism and on a mix of key geopolitical issues.” If confirmed, Mayorkas will be in charge of the department that, through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, manages the Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP), which Jewish synagogues and other institutions have relied upon especially in the aftermath of synagogue shootings and other anti-Semitic attacks over the past few years. While the Orthodox Union declined to comment on the picks, Nathan Diament, the organization’s executive director for public policy, told Jewish Insider in November that Mayorkas “was a very good partner in the leadership of DHS.” Aviva Klompas, who was the director of speechwriting for Israel’s U.N. mission under then-Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Ron Prosor, expressed hope that the upcoming Biden administration will continue the Trump administration’s policies of brokering normalization deals between Israel and other countries and on the Iranian threat. “We find ourselves at a promising historic juncture in the Middle East in which relations between Israel and the Muslim world are blossoming,” she told JNS. “I have no doubt that the Biden administration appointees will want to bring more countries to the table to sign peace agreements and bring greater stability to the Middle East for the simple reason that doing so is beneficial to the region and to the United States.” “At the same time,” continued Klompas, “I hope they will listen to the many voices in the Middle East cautioning that Iran remains the primary impediment to peace and stability and should be managed accordingly.” ‘Meaningful leadership and partnership in the search for solutions’ Democratic Majority for Israel president and CEO Mark Mellman told JNS, “President-elect Biden is assembling a national security and foreign policy team with broad knowledge, deep experience, and a strong commitment to the U.S.-Israel relationship. Together with the president-elect, these experienced, crisis-tested professionals will begin to restore America’s world leadership.” The American Jewish Committee applauded Biden for announcing Blinken as his choice to lead Foggy Bottom. “Tony Blinken has the breadth and depth of experience to ably oversee the implementation of U.S. foreign policy under President Biden,” said AJC CEO David Harris, who has met with Blinken on numerous occasions in the latter’s various posts. “He is intimately familiar with the full scope of the president-elect’s foreign-policy views, as well the issues of utmost concern to the Jewish community, including full-throated support for the U.S.-Israel relationship, widening the growing circle of Arab-Israel peace, the fight against global anti-Semitism, and the danger posed by Iran and its proxies.” AJC also praised the appointment of Kerry to the climate role, with the organization telling JNS that “as the first national Jewish organization to have a LEED-certified building, we are delighted to see this new position filled by someone we know well and have hosted several times at our Global Forum.” In a Twitter post, Harris also lauded Thomas-Greenfield. In a Twitter thread, J Street president Jeremy Ben-Ami applauded Monday’s developments. “The National Security team announced today by President-elect Biden represents exactly the type of leadership this country deserves and the world needs after four years of diplomatic and national security malpractice,” he tweeted. “The challenges facing us globally in the 21st century, as well as in the Middle East more specifically, require not just America’s re-engagement but our meaningful leadership and partnership in the search for solutions.” The challenges facing us globally in the 21st century, as well as in the Middle East more specifically, require not just America’s re-engagement but our meaningful leadership and partnership in the search for solutions. — Jeremy Ben-Ami (@JeremyBenAmi) November 23, 2020 B’nai B’rith International provided a neutral stance on Biden’s selections of Blinken, Sullivan and Thomas-Greenfield, though declined to comment on Kerry, Haines and Mayorkas. “We hope the new appointments at State, the NSC and the U.N. will encourage an expansion of Israel’s relations with Arab countries and that they will take a tough line on Iran’s nuclear program and its malign behavior in the region, and will continue a long tradition of fighting bias against Israel at the United Nations,” the organization’s CEO, Daniel Mariaschin, told JNS. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee declined to comment, citing its longstanding policy of not discussing administration nominations and appointments.

News article:
Former Israeli permanent representative to the UN Danny Danon said this week he would rather U.S. President-elect Joe Biden adopts his Democratic predecessor Bill Clinton's approach to the Middle East rather than that of Barack Obama, under whom he served as vice president. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter "Clinton was more of a negotiator, trying to mediate between the sides, while President Obama tried to force his views," Danon told Ynet. 5 View gallery U.S. President-elect Joe Biden ( Photo: Gettyimages ) "I think President-elect Biden will choose Clinton’s approach to the Middle East because he was there, and he knows it doesn’t work when you try to force your ideas. He was involved for many years, he knows the material, he knows the people and I’m sure he’ll bring his own ideas to the table." During his tenure, former Democratic President Barack Obama faced much scrutiny for his handling of Middle East affairs, more than once finding himself at loggerheads with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials, especially over Iran's nuclear arms program. In September 2012, Danon — a former Cabinet minister on behalf of the Likud Party — published his first book titled " Israel: the Will to Prevail ” in which he analyzes the Israel-U.S. relationship, and presents alternative approaches to the conventional wisdom on negotiating peace between Israelis and Palestinians while criticizing Obama's approach to Israel. 5 View gallery Former U.S. ambassador to the UN Nikko Haley and Former permanent representative to the UN Danny Danon ( Photo: U.S. Embassy in Israel ) Danon will be co-headlining the DiploTech Global Summit 2020 on December 16 alongside former U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley that will include world leaders, heads of states, ministers of foreign affairs, policymakers and diplomats who will meet with industry experts, investors and innovators for the first global summit of its kind. This exclusive event, headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel will see policymakers and world leaders conferring with leading experts from the fields of sustainable development, digitech, medtech and agtech. The prominent keynote speakers and carefully selected panelists will discuss and identify how our new world can best overcome the biggest global challenges and proactively prepare for a post-COVID world and collective sustainable future, where innovation and technology will play an even greater role. The event — initiated by Danon and chaired by Yossi Sagol, entrepreneur and Chairman of Sagol Holdings — will welcome Liz Claman, high profile anchor of the Fox Business Network show “The Claman Countdown”, as master of ceremonies for the diverse and prominent speakers, panelists and global guests. Keynote speakers will include Danon, Ambassador Haley, and Chairwoman and Chief Technology Officer at Diagnostic Robotics Kira Radinsky amongst others. 5 View gallery Diplotech takes place on December 16 in Tel Aviv Danon said he believed Israel will play a significant role in the global recovery from the pandemic thanks to its innovative nature and tumultuous history. "Every few years, we have a conflict or a war. If you look at Israel's history, we always had some challenges to overcome and each time we recovered very quickly. So I think we’ll be able to support not only our own economy and our own society but support other countries as well," he said. "There is a lot of interest in Israel from developing countries that look at it as a miracle and would like to emulate what we have done here in Israel." Danon also expressed hope that the signing of the Abraham Accords, a U.S.-brokered peace pact between Israel and Arab and Muslim states such as the Arabian Gulf states of Bahrain the United Arab Emirates, will mutually benefit all peoples of the region. 5 View gallery L-R: Bahrain FM Abdullatif al-Zayani, PM Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Emirati FM Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan at the signing ceremony of the Abraham Accords at the White House ( Photo: AFP ) "It won’t be only Israeli technology helping the people of the Gulf. This mutual cooperation will also benefit Israelis," he said. "At the beginning of the [coronavirus] crisis, one of the first countries to support Israel, in terms of medical supplies, was one of the Gulf countries. It’s important for me to make sure our colleagues know that we appreciate the mutual benefits of normalization. "More countries are interested in joining. I don’t know whether they’ll wait for the new U.S. president to step in but it's great for us and we’re looking forward to it." Amid a budget row between the government's two major parties, Likud and Blue & White, lawmakers last week passed in a preliminary vote a resolution to dissolve Knesset, seemingly setting the stage for Israel's fourth election in just under two years, which Danon deemed "irresponsible" and detrimental to Israel's COVID-19 response. 5 View gallery Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Benny Gantz ( Photo: GPO, AFP ) "I’m still hoping we’re not heading for another election. I think it's irresponsible. I expect both the defense minister [Blue & White Chairman Benny Gantz] and the prime minister [Likud Chairman Netanyahu] to settle their differences and postpone the election," he said. "I don’t think it’s what Israel needs right now before we head into the winter and before we have the vaccine available. Otherwise, we’ll have to invest a lot of funds and energy in the fourth election within two years instead of preparing ourselves for the winter.

News article:
i24 News – US President-elect Joe Biden’s advisers are divided on the prospect of rejoining the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, Israel Hayom reported Monday. According to the report, while the Biden campaign has said it wanted to rejoin the accord that US President Donald Trump pulled the US out of in 2018, some of Biden’s aides are pushing against it. The move would waste the headway made by the Trump administration in pressuring Tehran through its maximum pressure policy, they argue. The way to move forward, they purportedly assert, is to keep up the pressure from the sanctions slapped on Tehran by the Trump team to force Iran to expand the deal. The approach essentially mimics Trump’s strategy, with the sitting president betting on the sanctions to force Tehran to give up its ballistic missile program and support for regional terrorist groups — the areas that were not covered by the 2015 accord, which only zoomed in on Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. Iran denies that its nuclear aspirations have a military dimension and angrily lashes out at demands to give up the ballistic missile development project as well as regional meddling. After Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Tehran, Iran has been gradually rolling back its own commitments to the agreement. According to media reports, it recently notified the UN nuclear watchdog of an intention to install more advanced centrifuges underground and rebuilt a centrifuge assembly center destroyed by sabotage in summer.

The impending takeover of the White House by President-elect Joe Biden and departure of Donald Trump is unlikely to bring change in US policy towards Tehran, the daughter of assassinated Iranian General Qassem Soleimani told RT. “There’s no difference between Biden and Trump, they are the same guy. They are following the same policy, there’s no difference between them. Trump ordered the killing of my father, but Biden supported that, so there’s no difference,” Zeinab Soleimani told RT’s Afshin Rattansi on Going Underground in an interview to be aired on Wednesdsay. READ MORE: Joe Biden has a very short window of opportunity in which America’s return to Iran nuclear deal is possible President-elect Biden has signaled that he was ready to reinvigorate the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), that was thrown under the bus by Trump in 2018. Still, Biden’s background leaves a lot of room for doubt, according to Zeinab Soleimani, who said it was Barack Obama’s administration that facilitated the creation of the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) terrorist group and sent the whole Middle East into turmoil. Moreover, US policy towards Iran has remained pretty much the same for decades already, she argued, and the change of the figurehead in the White House does not really matter. The problem we have with America is their policy, this will not change. They are the same people, with the same mind, the same way. And each one is worse that the other one. Trump’s decision to order the assassination of General Soleimani stemmed from the fact that her father jeopardized US plans in the region, invoking fury in Washington, she said. General Soleimani was killed early this year outside Baghdad International Airport by a US air strike as he was traveling in a car alongside high-ranking Iraqi military officials. The killing triggered unprecedented nationwide mourning in Iran, as well as in other countries in the region. While the US regarded Soleimani as a “monster” – and he certainly was one for Washington – the slain general has been a true “savior” for the people of his country as well as other nations of the Middle East, Zeinab Soleimani said. My father did his job so well and made them so angry. You are seeing every plan they are making in the Middle East is destroyed. Everywhere they are trying to enter and hurt Iran they fail. Of course, for them my father is a big monster, but my father is a savior. The assassination of Soleimani, however, did not constitute a victory for the US, but actually backfired, his daughter believes. It invoked more anger and hatred towards Washington in Iran, as well as in other countries of the region. The killing has made more people want to follow in Soleimani’s steps and fight the US, she warned. “After killing my father, America thought that everything will be stopped, because they killed General Soleimani, the power of the Middle East. But they are so wrong,” she said. “They are so wrong in thinking this will be the end of General Soleimani, this is the beginning.” Also on rt.com US to draw down staff from Baghdad embassy amid ‘security concerns’ as anniversary of Soleimani assassination draws near – reports Zeinab Soleimani also touched upon one of the most recent hostile acts against Iran – the killing of the country’s leading nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who was assassinated near Tehran late in November. Those behind the murder are certainly “not human”, given how the scientist was slain in cold blood for merely working for his country, she believes “They’ve killed him so easily in his own country in front of… his wife,” she said. “How dare they come to our country and kill people so easily in the street?” Watch the full interview on Going Underground on December 16.

News article:
Iran’s supreme leader and the country’s president both warned America on Wednesday that the departure of President Donald Trump does not immediately mean better relations between the two nations. The remarks come as Iran approaches the first anniversary of the U.S. drone strike that killed Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad, an attack that nearly plunged Washington and Tehran into an open war after months of tensions. In recent weeks, a scientist who founded Iran’s military nuclear program two decades ago was gunned down in an attack in a rural area outside of Tehran that The Associated Press accessed for the first time Wednesday. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei spoke in Tehran at the Imam Khomeini Hosseinieh, or congregation hall, where he attended a meeting with Soleimani’s family and top military leaders. They all sat some 16 feet away from the 81-year-old Khamenei, who wore a face mask due to the coronavirus pandemic still raging in Iran. US BLAMES IRAN FOR PRESUMED DEATH OF ROBERT LEVINSON, SANCTIONS TWO INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS "You saw that what Trump’s America and (former President Barack) Obama’s America did to you," Khamenei said. "The hostilities are not just for Trump’s America, which ends when he leaves. Obama’s America also did bad things to you and the Iranian nation." Earlier in the day, Rouhani, speaking during a Cabinet meeting, made a similar point to criticize Trump -- at one point even saying the U.S. president "has committed so many crimes, he was an assassin and a terrorist." "Some people say, ‘You are excited for Mr. Biden,’" Rouhani said. "No, we are not excited Mr. Biden is taking office, but we are very happy Mr. Trump is gone." "The upcoming American administration can choose what to do," Rouhani said. "The path is open. It’s up to them if they are grateful or ungrateful. If they want the right path, it’s ready. If they want the wrong path, that one is ready for them as well." Biden has suggested the U.S. could rejoin Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, from which Trump unilaterally pulled America in 2018 and imposed harsher sanctions on Iran. That decision marked the start of increased tensions between the two countries as Iran abandoned uranium enrichment limits and the Mideast saw a series of escalating incidents and attacks. TRUMP, BIDEN OFFICIALS CONDEMN IRAN REGIME’S KIDNAPPING, EXECUTION OF REPORTER In response to Soleimani’s death, Tehran launched a ballistic missile attack that injured dozens of U.S. troops in Iraq. That same night, it also mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian airliner taking off from Tehran, killing all 176 people on board. Hoping to pressure Europe, Iran’s parliament recently passed a bill calling on Tehran to increase its uranium enrichment to 20 percent, a short technical step from weapons-grade levels, and to throw out international inspectors. Rouhani’s government has opposed the bill, exposing a rift inside Iran’s civilian government that the supreme leader appeared to touch on in his speech Wednesday. "Resolve your disputes by negotiating with each other," Khamenei said. "Are you not saying that we should negotiate with the world, is it not possible to negotiate and resolve disputes with the internal element?" That bill came after the Nov. 27 killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who headed Iran’s so-called AMAD project, which Israel and the West have alleged was a military operation looking at the feasibility of building a nuclear weapon. The International Atomic Energy Agency says that "structured program" ended in 2003. U.S. intelligence agencies concurred with that assessment in a 2007 report and the State Department agreed with it as recently as last year. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Israel, suspected of carrying out Fakhrizadeh’s slaying, insists Iran still maintains the ambition of developing nuclear weapons, pointing to Tehran’s ballistic missile program and research into other technologies. Iran long has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful. AP journalists accessed the site of Fakhrizadeh’s killing for the first time on Wednesday just outside the town of Absard. Apple orchards line the road in front of the snowcapped Alborz mountain range. A new sign hung over a damaged electrical power pole where his bullet-riddled car came to rest, identifying it as "the site of ascension of martyred scientist ... to heaven."

President-elect Joe Biden's team is preparing to hold negotiations with the administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a bid to help the Latin American country end its ongoing economic and humanitarian crisis, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. According to the media outlet, the Democrat's team will push Maduro to hold "free and fair elections", promising to lift some of the sanctions in return. Biden's future administration is already reportedly looking at options for both sanctions relief if Maduro agrees and an expansion of the economic measures if he fails to do so. According to the sources, China, Cuba, Iran, and Russia, all of them supporters of Maduro, will play some role in these talks between Caracas and Washington.

News article:
JNS.org – A group of 150 Democrats in the US House of Representatives has signed a letter calling on US President-elect Joe Biden to “swiftly” reenter the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. In the Dec. 23 letter, they wrote that “diplomacy is the best path to halt and reverse Iran’s nuclear program, decrease tensions in the region and facilitate our nation’s reincorporation into the international community. We are united in our support for swiftly taking the necessary diplomatic steps to restore constraints on Iran’s nuclear program and return both Iran and the United States to compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as a starting point for further negotiations.” The signees claim that the agreement “verifiably constrained Iran’s nuclear program until after the United States’ unilateral withdrawal.” The Trump administration withdrew in May 2018 from the 2015 accord, reimposing sanctions lifted under it, along with enacting new ones as part of what it called a “maximum pressure” campaign. The Democratic signees wrote that “has left Iran with an unconstrained nuclear program, failed effectively to address Iran’s other malign behavior and greatly increased the likelihood of violent confrontation and conflict.” Related coverage Turkish Air Strikes Target Kurdish Militants in Syria, Iraq After Bomb Attack Turkish warplanes carried out air strikes on Kurdish militant bases in northern Syria and northern Iraq on Sunday, destroying 89... They continued, saying “this incoherent and provocative policy has increased regional tension and attacks against our troops and our partners and emboldened Iranian hardliners. As a result, the risk of potentially devastating miscalculation remains unnecessarily high. Re-engaging multilaterally on preventing the development of an Iranian nuclear weapon and reopening channels of communication are essential to reversing these dangerous developments.” Additionally, the letter said “Iran’s other destabilizing activities in the region, such as its support for terrorism, development of ballistic missiles, human rights violations against its own people and holding of foreign political prisoners, including Americans, warrant strong and coordinated international diplomacy. The JCPOA does not prevent our ability to address these destabilizing activities. An unrestrained Iranian nuclear program would exacerbate these other threats posed by Iran and inspire a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.” Biden has said America would rejoin the deal if Iran returns to compliance and that, if the Islamic Republic does so, there would be follow-up negotiations that would also address Iran’s ballistic missile program, support for terrorism and human rights violations.

News article:
Iran regime ups pressure on Biden to return to nuclear deal Dr. Majid Rafizadeh President Hassan Rouhani, right, and Atomic Energy Organization chief Ali Akbar Salehi in the control room of the Bushehr nuclear power plant. (AFP) Short Url https://arab.news/pj46s The Iranian regime has started its campaign to rush the incoming Biden administration into immediately rejoining the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal. However, the strategy the Iranian leaders are employing is not anchored in diplomacy; instead it is based on issuing threats, fear-mongering tactics, and the ratcheting up of military adventurism in the region. For instance, the theocratic establishment last week began enriching uranium to 20 percent purity at the underground Fordow nuclear facility, meaning it is now just a short technical step away from weapons-grade level. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is also playing its part. It last week seized a South Korean-flagged ship, which it claimed was carrying thousands of tons of ethanol, in the Gulf. This alarmed the US State Department, with a spokesperson noting: “The regime continues to threaten navigational rights and freedoms in the Gulf as part of a clear attempt to extort the international community into relieving the pressure of sanctions. We join the Republic of Korea’s call for Iran to immediately release the tanker.” In addition, the Iranian parliament in November passed a law that requires the government to expel all International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors from the country if US sanctions are not lifted by Feb. 21. These tactics are aimed at giving the regime more leverage ahead of the start of negotiations with the Biden administration, as well as the means to obtain more concessions and greater appeasement from the next US president. Tehran even wants compensation for the economic losses it has suffered since President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the nuclear deal in 2018. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in 2019: “If you wish more, if you require more, you should give and pay more.” The regime even came up with a figure, with the judiciary demanding the US pays $130 billion in damages. In September last year, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told a forum organized by New York’s Council on Foreign Relations: “Compensate us for our losses.” He added: “A sign of good faith is not to try to renegotiate what has already been negotiated.” The Iranian leaders used the same threatening tactics ahead of the signing of the nuclear deal in 2015. The Obama administration’s negotiating team gave unprecedented concessions to the regime, including the deal’s sunset clauses, which set an expiration date for the restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program, and exempting Iran’s military sites from being inspected by the IAEA. Military sites are the most likely locations where Iran advances its nuclear program, with satellite images recently indicating that new facilities are being built near the fortified Fordow site. While the regime has made no public statement about the work, it previously acknowledged similar defensive construction at the Natanz nuclear facility. Meanwhile, the main coalition of Iranian opposition groups, known as the National Council of Resistance of Iran, in October announced the discovery of a secret new military facility east of Tehran. The group claimed the site was controlled by the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research, which is primarily responsible for weaponizing Iran’s nuclear program. Its tactics are aimed at gaining leverage ahead of the start of negotiations with the Biden administration. Dr. Majid Rafizadeh The regime’s heightened threats and warnings betray the fact that Tehran is desperate to re-enter the nuclear deal and have all sanctions lifted. It is anticipating that President-elect Joe Biden will adopt a softer policy than his predecessor after he stated in a September op-ed for CNN: “I will offer Tehran a credible path back to diplomacy. If Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal, the United States would rejoin the agreement as a starting point for follow-on negotiations. With our allies, we will work to strengthen and extend the nuclear deal’s provisions, while also addressing other issues of concern.” However, the Iranian leaders want more than just the US re-entering the 2015 nuclear deal. The Iranian regime is using its nuclear program to extort other governments, particularly by escalating its threats and nuclear violations in order to rush Biden into rejoining the nuclear deal and to get more concessions from his administration.

News article:
Officials in the incoming Biden administration have already begun holding quiet talks with Iran on a return to the 2015 nuclear deal, and have updated Israel on those conversations, Channel 12 News reported Saturday. The network gave no sourcing for the report, and no details on what was allegedly discussed. US President-elect Joe Biden has indicated his desire to return to the accord, while Israel is pushing for any return to the deal to include fresh limitations on Iran’s ballistic missile program and support for terror and destabilization around the world. On Wednesday, Walla News reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is assembling a team to strategize for the first talks with the Biden administration on Iran’s nuclear program. The team will include officials representing national security elements, the Foreign Ministry, the Defense Ministry, the military, the Mossad spy agency, and the Atomic Energy Commission, the report said, citing unnamed sources in the Prime Minister’s Office. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Netanyahu is considering appointing a senior official to head the team and to serve as an envoy in talks with the US on the Iranian nuclear program, the report said. A possible candidate to head the team is Mossad chief Yossi Cohen, the report said. Channel 12 reported Saturday that Cohen was in Washington this week to meet with officials in the outgoing and incoming administrations. Advertisement US President-elect Joe Biden is expected to take a more conciliatory approach to Iran than the Trump administration and has said that if Iran returns to the terms of the 2015 nuclear agreement, he too would rejoin, removing the crushing economic sanctions that have wreaked havoc on the Iranian economy over the past two years. The US president-elect has indicated that he wants to negotiate more broadly with Tehran if Washington returns to the deal, notably over its missiles and influence across the Middle East. Iran has said it could welcome the return of the Americans to the agreement, but only after they lift sanctions. It has rejected negotiation on other issues. Former US president Barack Obama, with Biden as his vice president, signed the Iran nuclear deal with world powers in 2015. The Trump administration withdrew from the accord in 2018 and pressured Iran with crippling economic sanctions and other measures. Obama signed the agreement despite fierce protest from Israel, and had a rocky relationship with Jerusalem and Netanyahu, while the premier and Trump have been in lockstep on most Middle East policy issues. The prospect of the US reengaging with Tehran has drawn warnings and alarm from Netanyahu and his allies. Last week, speaking alongside US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in Jerusalem, Netanyahu warned against the US rejoining the nuclear agreement, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Advertisement “If we just go back to the JCPOA, what will happen and may already be happening is that many other countries in the Middle East will rush to arm themselves with nuclear weapons. That is a nightmare and that is folly. It should not happen,” Netanyahu said. Likud MK Tzachi Hanegbi said Wednesday the incoming US administration must not “appease” Iran, and warned Tehran the Jewish state will not tolerate its military presence in Syria or its development of nuclear weapons. In one of the most forceful statements recently made by an Israeli official, Hanegbi, considered an ally of Netanyahu, threatened that Israel could attack Iran’s nuclear program if the United States rejoined the nuclear deal. Iran and the Trump administration have engaged in an ongoing exchange in recent months as President Donald Trump’s tenure draws to a close and Iran marked the one-year anniversary of the US assassination of its general Qassem Soleimani. The back and forth has included threats, military maneuvers, legal action and escalating Iranian violations of the nuclear deal. Israeli and Iranian officials have also exchanged threats in recent weeks. Channel 12 said Saturday that during his meetings with top Trump administration officials, Mossad chief Cohen was given the impression that there was no plan to attack Iran during the final days of the administration. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo publicly accused Iran of harboring al-Qaeda terrorists on Wednesday. Iran resumed enriching uranium to 20 percent last week, well in excess of the threshold set out in the nuclear deal and a short jump from the level of enrichment needed to produce weapons. Further complicating the Biden administration’s plans to reengage with Tehran were two high profile assassinations this year in Iran that were attributed to Israel. Top Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was gunned down outside Tehran in November in a hit Iranian officials blamed on Israel. In August, Israeli agents killed al-Qaeda’s second-in-command in Tehran at the behest of the US, according to a New York Times report.

News article:
As the United States enters the Biden era, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) warns that the relationship between Washington and Jerusalem is poised to become particularly fragile, mainly because he believes the policies the new administration will pursue with respect to Iran will pose significant security challenges for Israel. Incoming U.S. President Joe Biden—Cruz did attend his Jan. 20 inauguration—has already stated that he plans to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran in lieu of the 2015 accord from which outgoing President Donald Trump withdrew in 2018. Following the Nov. 3 elections, Tehran has been growing brazen in its violations of the accord, in what experts believe is an attempt to produce leverage for future talks with Washington. The situation with Iran, Cruz told Israel Hayom, could prove precarious. “I think the greatest national security threat to Israel that will be posed by the Biden-Harris administration will be their attempt to re-establish the disastrous Iran nuclear deal,” said Cruz. “Under President Obama, the signature so-called foreign-policy achievement of his second term was sending hundreds of billions of dollars to [Iranian Supreme Leader] Ayatollah [Ali] Khamenei [as part of the 2015 nuclear deal], who regularly chants ‘Death to America’ and ‘Death to Israel.’ The Biden-Harris administration will set as their top foreign-policy objective restoring that failed agreement. The single most important national security victory of the last four years was pulling out that disastrous deal,” he said. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories “There was a vigorous debate in the administration [about] whether to do so. Both the State Department and the Pentagon advocated staying in the deal. I argued vigorously, multiple times, that we should pull out of the deal, and President Trump agreed with me and overruled his own defense department and state department,” said Cruz. “I fear we are headed into a dangerous chapter with the Biden-Harris administration, working actively to undermine the national security gains made in the last four years, and to reinvigorate the ayatollahs in Iran, which poses an existential threat to Israel,” he added. Cruz further said he believes that the Democratic Party has been overrun by the radical forces within it. “Unfortunately, the Democratic Party today is being driven by the extreme and angry left. The voices who are setting the agenda are [Sens.] Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and [Rep.] Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. They are unapologetic socialists, they are advocating abolishing the police, packing the U.S. Supreme Court and ushering in a fundamental transformation of American society. I don’t believe the voters want that. I don’t believe that is consistent with the views and values of the American people.” Still, even with the Democrats essentially in control of both chambers of Congress, “I believe America will continue to stand alongside Israel,” said Cruz. “There is to be sure an anti-Israel and an anti-Semitic far-left in the Democratic Party. And with Democratic majorities, that extreme faction will have greater influence. That being said, for eight years, I have endeavored to be the leading defender of Israel in the United States Senate, and I intend to continue to do so. And I am hopeful that there will remain a significant bipartisan coalition to stand alongside Israel,” he added. Touching on the U.S. Capitol riots and their aftermath, Cruz told Israel Hayom that while he believes “the president’s language and rhetoric were reckless and irresponsible,” the backlash and expedited impeachment proceedings were extreme. “The Democrats and the media are overreaching. This vindictive impeachment action, combined with a social-media purge by Big Tech of conservative voices, is reminiscent of the final scene of every one of the Godfather movies. They are trying to settle their debts and eliminate their enemies. It is transparently political; it is not being honest with the American people, and I believe the people are smart enough to understand that the angry partisan politics being carried out by the Democrats is not good for our country,” he said. “We are deeply divided, and we need to come together and unify. We can and should have vigorous debates on policies, but the angry, emotional hatred, the rage, that today’s Democrats are manifesting is not helping for the nation.” This article first appeared in Israel Hayom.

They are trying to settle their debts and eliminate their enemies. It is transparently political; it is not being honest with the American people, and I believe the people are smart enough to understand that the angry partisan politics being carried out by the Democrats is not good for our country,” he said. “We are deeply divided, and we need to come together and unify. We can and should have vigorous debates on policies, but the angry, emotional hatred, the rage, that today’s Democrats are manifesting is not helping for the nation.” This article first appeared in Israel Hayom.

News article:
As the United States enters the Biden era, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) warns that the relationship between Washington and Jerusalem is poised to become particularly fragile, mainly because he believes the policies the new administration will pursue with respect to Iran will pose significant security challenges for Israel. Incoming U.S. President Joe Biden—Cruz did attend his Jan. 20 inauguration—has already stated that he plans to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran in lieu of the 2015 accord from which outgoing President Donald Trump withdrew in 2018. Following the Nov. 3 elections, Tehran has been growing brazen in its violations of the accord, in what experts believe is an attempt to produce leverage for future talks with Washington. The situation with Iran, Cruz told Israel Hayom, could prove precarious. “I think the greatest national security threat to Israel that will be posed by the Biden-Harris administration will be their attempt to re-establish the disastrous Iran nuclear deal,” said Cruz. “Under President Obama, the signature so-called foreign-policy achievement of his second term was sending hundreds of billions of dollars to [Iranian Supreme Leader] Ayatollah [Ali] Khamenei [as part of the 2015 nuclear deal], who regularly chants ‘Death to America’ and ‘Death to Israel.’ The Biden-Harris administration will set as their top foreign-policy objective restoring that failed agreement. The single most important national security victory of the last four years was pulling out that disastrous deal,” he said. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories “There was a vigorous debate in the administration [about] whether to do so. Both the State Department and the Pentagon advocated staying in the deal. I argued vigorously, multiple times, that we should pull out of the deal, and President Trump agreed with me and overruled his own defense department and state department,” said Cruz. “I fear we are headed into a dangerous chapter with the Biden-Harris administration, working actively to undermine the national security gains made in the last four years, and to reinvigorate the ayatollahs in Iran, which poses an existential threat to Israel,” he added. Cruz further said he believes that the Democratic Party has been overrun by the radical forces within it. “Unfortunately, the Democratic Party today is being driven by the extreme and angry left. The voices who are setting the agenda are [Sens.] Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and [Rep.] Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. They are unapologetic socialists, they are advocating abolishing the police, packing the U.S. Supreme Court and ushering in a fundamental transformation of American society. I don’t believe the voters want that. I don’t believe that is consistent with the views and values of the American people.” Still, even with the Democrats essentially in control of both chambers of Congress, “I believe America will continue to stand alongside Israel,” said Cruz. “There is to be sure an anti-Israel and an anti-Semitic far-left in the Democratic Party. And with Democratic majorities, that extreme faction will have greater influence. That being said, for eight years, I have endeavored to be the leading defender of Israel in the United States Senate, and I intend to continue to do so. And I am hopeful that there will remain a significant bipartisan coalition to stand alongside Israel,” he added. Touching on the U.S. Capitol riots and their aftermath, Cruz told Israel Hayom that while he believes “the president’s language and rhetoric were reckless and irresponsible,” the backlash and expedited impeachment proceedings were extreme. “The Democrats and the media are overreaching.

News article:
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani urged the incoming U.S. administration on Wednesday to return to a 2015 nuclear agreement and lift sanctions on Tehran, while welcoming the end of "tyrant" President Donald Trump's era. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Wednesday, has said the United States will rejoin the pact, which includes restrictions on Iran's nuclear work, if Tehran resumes strict compliance. "The ball is in the U.S. court now. If Washington returns to Iran's 2015 nuclear deal, we will also fully respect our commitments under the pact," Rouhani said in a televised cabinet meeting. "Today, we expect the incoming U.S. administration to return to the rule of law and commit themselves, and if they can, in the next four years, to remove all the black spots of the previous four years," he said. Tensions have grown between Tehran and Washington since 2018, when Trump quit the deal between Iran and six world powers that sought to limit Tehran's nuclear program and prevent it developing atomic weapons. Washington reimposed sanctions that have badly hit Iran's economy. Iran, which denies ever seeking nuclear arms, retaliated to Trump's "maximum pressure" policy by gradually breaching the accord. Tehran has repeatedly said it can quickly reverse those violations if U.S. sanctions are removed. "Tyrant Trump's political career and his ominous reign are over today and his 'maximum pressure' policy on Iran has completely failed," Rouhani said. "Trump is dead but the nuclear deal is still alive." Antony Blinken, Biden's choice for secretary of state, said on Tuesday the U.S. would not take a quick decision on whether to rejoin the pact. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics Biden appears to see a return to the deal as a prelude to wider talks on Iran's nuclear work, its ballistic missiles and regional activities. But Tehran has ruled out halting its missile program or changing its regional policy. Biden's choice to lead the Pentagon, retired Army General Lloyd Austin, said on Tuesday that Iran posed a threat to American allies in the region and forces stationed in the Middle East. "The United States and other Western countries have turned our region to a powder keg, not Iran," Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told state TV.

News article:
US President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee for secretary of state, Tony Blinken, said Tuesday that the incoming administration will consult with Israel and Arab allies in the Middle East before it makes decisions about reentering the Iran nuclear agreement. Biden “believes that if Iran comes back into compliance, we would too,” Blinken said at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “But we would use that as a platform with our allies and partners, who would once again be on the same side with us, to seek a longer and stronger agreement,” Blinken said. “It’s vitally important that we engage on the takeoff, not the landing, with our allies and partners in the region, to include Israel and to include the Gulf countries,” he said, adding that a new agreement could address Iran’s “destabilizing activities” in the region as well as its missiles. “Having said that, I think we’re a long way from there,” Blinken said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Biden has said that returning to the 2015 deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), would be a top priority for him in the Middle East. US President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and imposed crushing sanctions that have wreaked havoc on the Iranian economy. Biden has said the US would return to the JCPOA so long as Iran returns to strict compliance with the deal first. Over the past several weeks, Tehran has begun enriching uranium up to 20%, in direct violation of the accord. Biden has also said he intends to enter subsequent negotiations to reach a “longer and stronger” deal with Tehran that would also address its ballistic missile program and regional hegemony. Iran has said it is not interested in reaching subsequent agreements. Advertisement Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned against the US rejoining the agreement, speaking out in November and December against the move and urging Biden to continue Trump’s maximum pressure campaign of sanctions against Iran. However, Israel’s ambassador to the US, Ron Dermer, called on Biden to consult with Israel and the Gulf states before returning to the JCPOA. At his confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Blinken assured the committee that the Biden administration would do just that and also engage with Congress before striking any deal with Iran. Blinken was more circumspect when asked if he would be willing to discuss an alternative to the JCPOA: “I welcome talking to… the members of this committee about the way forward on Iran.” “We are much better off if we can try and work through these issues together. You have my commitment that we intend and will do that and I look forward to the consultations that we’ll have,” he said. “President-elect Biden is committed to the proposition that Iran will not be permitted to acquire a nuclear weapon,” Blinken continued, while saying the Iran deal signed under former president Barack Obama, with Biden as his vice president, “was succeeding on its own terms.” Advertisement “If Iran comes back into compliance, then we would too,” Blinken said, while acknowledging that “we are a long way from there.” As for Trump’s decision to assassinate top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani last year, Blinken argued that it made the region less safe. Normalization deals, two-state solution Blinken praised the Abraham Accords negotiated by the Trump administration that saw Israel normalize ties with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, saying such agreements make the region safer. However, he said the Biden administration would “take a hard look at” some of the “commitments” that were made in tandem with those accords. He appeared to be referencing weapons deals made with the UAE, which was set to receive 50 F-35 advanced fighter jets from the US following the signing of the normalization agreement. In a November interview with The Times of Israel, Blinken panned the apparent “quid pro quo” nature of the F-35 sale that immediately followed the normalization agreement. “The Obama-Biden administration made those planes available to Israel and only Israel in the region,” said Blinken, who served as Biden’s national security adviser, deputy national security adviser to the president and deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration. During the Tuesday committee hearing, Blinken expressed hope that the Abraham Accords will provide Israel with a new sense of “confidence and security” to reach an agreement with the Palestinians. He went on to call the US commitment to Israel’s security “sacrosanct” and later said that he does not consider Israel a “racist nation” when asked by Senator Lindsey Graham. Advertisement Blinken threw his support behind a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians, while expressing doubt that such a deal could be reached in the near future. “The only way to ensure Israel’s future as a Jewish, democratic state and to give the Palestinians a state to which they are entitled is through the so-called two-state solution,” Blinken said, while adding that he opposes “unilateral” efforts by either party that make reaching such a solution more difficult. Blinken later said he and Biden are “resolutely opposed” to the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel because it “unfairly and inappropriately singles out Israel and creates a double standard that we do not apply to other countries.” “At the same time, I fully respect the first amendment rights of Americans to say what they believe,” he added, saying he would oppose measures backed by some US Jewish groups to sanction those who boycott Israel. Blinken also committed to not reversing Trump’s decision to transfer the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, adding that the holy city is Israel’s capital.

News article:
While the world has been distracted by COVID-19 and the changing Administration in Washington, Iran has quietly moved closer to developing weapons-grade nuclear material. As Joe Biden steps into the U.S. Presidency this month amid a range of crises, the threat of nuclear proliferation cannot be ignored. Biden must quickly address Iran’s growing nuclear capabilities in addition to the raging pandemic, a troubled U.S. vaccine rollout, a failing economy and the potential for more violence from right-wing extremists. The insidious danger of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East is an undeniable threat to America’s national security and global stability. Iran will continue its menacing forward march to enrich uranium unless the United States takes a firm stance to curtail the country’s dangerous behavior. Biden must confront Iran and thwart this growing nuclear threat which has continued to expand since the Trump administration withdrew from the deeply flawed Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in May 2018. Pressure will be on the Biden Administration to address this challenge and contain Iran, which continues to blatantly ignore the restrictions set in place by the JCPOA to control the mullah’s pursuit of an atomic arsenal. We have learned through the media that Iran has restarted its enrichment program and is capable of producing even more quantities of highly-enriched uranium. The danger of nuclear proliferation is growing exponentially with each passing day. Reports indicate that Iran’s stockpile of low-enriched uranium exceeds the JCPOA limit by more than 12 times and that its uranium had been enriched up to 4.5 percent, far above the 3.67 percent threshold established by the Iran nuclear deal. This unfettered proliferation is a clear threat to world peace. Biden and his foreign policy team must address this growing threat without returning to the JCPOA, which failed to halt Iran’s missile program or its aggressive military moves and rhetoric against its neighbors. America will need to remain engaged and alert on this issue. Iran continues to be a dangerous force in the Middle East and the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. Iran has been labeled as such by the State Department since 1984, and continues to provide moral, economic and military support to Hezbollah, as well as various Palestinian terror groups in Gaza. This is in addition to other terrorist organizations in Iraq, Syria and throughout the Middle East. It was the Iran-backed Kata’ib Hezbollah that launched a rocket attack against American interests in Iraq in December 2019 that left an American citizen dead. In addition, tensions have risen steadily since the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, nearly erupting in conflict in 2020 after President Trump ordered a military strike that killed a top general responsible for attacks that killed dozens of innocents. Advertisement These next few weeks following Biden’s swearing-in as President will be hectic, but his national security team must view Iran as an urgent priority as it begins its meetings. Last September, Biden told the media the United States would rejoin the Iran nuclear deal as a starting point if Iran agreed to strictly comply with the pact’s provisions. But this path is fraught with problems. The JCPOA included unacceptable sunset clauses that stipulated when Iran could resume some of its weapons programs, among other shortcomings. The Biden administration may also find itself under pressure to continue the strict economic sanctions put into place by the Trump Administration. Iran is hoping to see those rolled back. Expect Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prioritize discussions about Iran during meetings with Biden. The two know each other well because they have worked together over a span of nearly 40 years. Biden has in-depth knowledge of the Iran nuclear issue, having served as a longtime member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations as Chairman and Ranking Member. The Iran nuclear deal was clearly a major focus during his two terms as Vice President in the Obama Administration when the agreement was negotiated. Biden must move to contain Iran and make certain the country’s leaders no longer feel they have free rein to continue down the dangerous path of nuclear proliferation.

News article:
Newly inaugurated US President Joe Biden’s administration will launch an initiative through European mediators to open a direct dialogue with Tehran, a source in Washington told Sky News Arabia on Monday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that “there will be a new approach that seeks to reassert US deterrence in the region and create a solution to the conflict with Tehran.” The official said the new approach will be accompanied by contacts with the allies of the United States in the region, specifically with Gulf countries and Israel. An unsourced report by Israel’s Channel 12 news said last week that officials in the Biden administration have already begun holding quiet talks with Iran on a return to the 2015 nuclear deal, and have updated Israel on those conversations. Biden has indicated his desire to return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the deal is known, while Israel has been pushing for any return to the agreement to include fresh limitations on Iran’s ballistic missile program and its support for terror and destabilization around the world. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The JCPOA was signed by Iran and six world powers known as the P5+1 in 2015. Then-US president Donald Trump unilaterally pulled the US out of the deal in 2018, opting instead for a “maximum pressure” sanctions effort. Since 2019, Tehran has suspended its compliance with most of the limits set by the agreement in response to Washington’s abandonment of sanctions relief and the failure of other parties to the deal to make up for it. It is now enriching uranium to 20 percent, just a short step away from weapons-grade levels. Iranian diplomats have been in touch with members of Biden’s administration about restarting talks on Tehran’s nuclear program and have laid out seven preconditions, a source in Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s office told a Kuwaiti newspaper on Sunday. Advertisement Speaking to Kuwait’s al-Jarida newspaper, the Iranian official said that contacts began before Biden took office, and indicated that they are ongoing but informal. In an article published Friday in Foreign Affairs, Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote that Iran will not accept any new demands or terms to the deal proposed by Washington or any other signatories to the agreement. If the US began by “unconditionally removing, with full effect, all sanctions imposed, reimposed, or relabeled since Trump took office,” Iran would reverse the measures it has taken since the American withdrawal from the deal in 2018, Zarif said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to dispatch Mossad chief Yossi Cohen to Washington in the coming weeks to lay out Israel’s demands of the Biden administration for any new version of the Iran nuclear deal, Channel 12 news reported Saturday night. The network said Cohen, one of Netanyahu’s most trusted operatives, is to travel to the US within the next month and will be the first senior Israeli official to meet Biden. Cohen is also expected to meet with the head of the CIA. Lazar Berman contributed to this report.

News article:
WASHINGTON — Iran has no plans to hold talks with the Biden administration and is waiting for the new U.S. president to take the first step to lift sanctions and return the U.S. to the 2015 multinational nuclear agreement, Tehran's U.N. ambassador told NBC News on Monday. In his first interview since President Joe Biden was sworn in last week, Amb. Majid Takht Ravanchi told NBC's Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel that Iran has not spoken to the new administration yet. "No, there has not been any conversation between Iran and the U.S. after Biden came into office," Ravanchi said. Asked if there were plans to open up a direct dialogue with Washington or indirect communication through an intermediary, perhaps via the Swiss government, Ravanchi said, "We are not planning to initiate anything." The Swiss foreign ministry handles any official U.S. communication with Iran, because Washington has no embassy in Tehran and no formal diplomatic relations with Iran. Echoing similar statements from Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian diplomat said Tehran was not prepared to offer goodwill gestures or confidence-building steps until the U.S. returned to the nuclear agreement it left in 2018. In the meantime, Iran was in no rush, Ravanchi said. "It's up to the U.S. to decide what course of action to take. We're not in a hurry," he said. Iran's economy has dramatically contracted under the weight of U.S. sanctions which were reimposed after ex-President Donald Trump withdrew the United States in 2018 from an international nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers. The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA, introduced strict limits on Iran's nuclear program in return for easing economic sanctions. As a candidate, Biden said he would have the United States return to the agreement if Iran met its obligations under the deal. Citing Biden's statements, Ravanchi said Iran wanted to see the new president make good on his promises and if he did, Tehran would be ready to once again abide by the terms of the accord. "The ball is in the U.S. court," Ravanchi said. "It is totally up to the new administration. So as soon as they implement their obligations, Iran has said on numerous occasions that Iran will return to the full implementation of its undertakings." Despite Iran's contention that the first move is up to Washington, members of Biden's national security team have suggested the new administration was not on the verge of a quick decision to rejoin the nuclear deal. "We are a long way from there," Antony Blinken, Biden's pick for secretary of state, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Jan. 19. Blinken said the administration would first need to evaluate if Iran was complying with the nuclear agreement. Avril Haines, Biden's choice as director of national intelligence, also indicated at her Senate confirmation hearing that there was no imminent decision coming on returning to the agreement. Since Trump pulled the U.S. out of the agreement, Iran has gradually breached the deal's restrictions on uranium enrichment, shrinking the time it would take for the regime to secure nuclear weapons. Nuclear experts say that Iran's "breakout time" to secure enough weapons-grade material for an atomic bomb has dropped from 12 months when the agreement came into force to about three to four months. Ravanchi said Iran does not seek a nuclear arsenal and simply wants to build a nuclear energy program for civilian purposes. Ravanchi said it would be "absurd" for Iran to take conciliatory steps now when it was the U.S. that violated the 2015 agreement by withdrawing. "Words are not enough. We need to see action on the part of the United States," he said. Reviving the deal also could be complicated by the imprisonment of another American in Iran. Only weeks after Biden was elected in November, and three days after an Iranian nuclear scientist was assassinated, Iranian authorities convicted and imprisoned an Iranian-American businessman, Emad Shargi, on spying charges, NBC News previously reported. Ravanchi did not comment specifically on the case but said Iran would be open to an exchange of Iranian nationals detained in the United States in return for American citizens imprisoned in Iran. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics "We are ready to engage on a comprehensive exchange of all prisoners or detainees on both sides, in the United States, in Iran, and those that are waiting to be extradited to the United States. And this is a very simple and straightforward proposition," Ravanchi said. Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Blinken, told senators last week that securing the release of Americans held in Iran or elsewhere abroad would be a top priority. Ravanchi also reiterated Iran's vow that it would retaliate for the killing of top Gen. Qassem Soleimani a year ago, though he did not specify what form that response would take. He said that ex-President Trump "started a very dangerous game by assassinating General Soleimani. And we said that this cannot be unpunished. So this is our position." Soleimani, one of the country's most powerful military and political figures, was the leader of the Quds Force, the overseas operational arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, set up in the wake of the Iranian revolution in 1979. Before killing Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad, the Trump administration had pointed to Iran as the source of attacks against U.S. servicemen and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, alleging that Soleimani had plans for additional attacks against American interests in the region.

LONDON: Iran’s seizure of a South Korean-flagged tanker has provoked anger in Seoul and dominated news outlets there with calls to free the vessel. Meanwhile, in Iran there has been gloating among media over the capture of the Hankuk Chemi by the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz. Korea demanded that Iran release the vessel and sent a navy anti-piracy unit to the area. On Tuesday Seoul said it planned to dispatch a delegation of officials to secure the release of the ship and its crew. Iran claimed the ship was captured because it was causing pollution in the Arabian Gulf. But Tehran has also accused Seoul of holding $7 billion of funds for oil sales due to tough US sanctions. In an editorial entitled “Bring them back,” the “Korea JoongAng Daily” said the 20 crew members, including five Korean nationals, must be released. The “Korean Herald” print front page led with the headline “Seoul demands release of S. Korean tanker seized by Iran, sends military” with a giant photo from the ship’s bridge with the IRGC speedboat alongside. Korea’s attempt to find a way out of the crisis was in marked contrast to the approach of Iranian news websites, which trumpeted the ship’s capture as a major success. While Tehran on Tuesday continued to claim the seizure was not related to the frozen funds it claims it is owed, outlets liked to the IRGC made clear it was directly related.

South Korean tanker the MT Hankuk Chemi was boarded by armed members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) under the pretext of an unspecified inspection, an anonymous official from DM Shipping, which owns the vessel, told the AP. According to the source, the tanker was sailing from Jubail, Saudi Arabia, to Fujairah, the UAE, when Iranian forces requested to board the ship. The ship's captain reportedly alerted the company's security while IRGC troops were purportedly storming the ship. An Iranian helicopter was allegedly circling around the vessel during the process.

News article:
DUBAI: The South Korean government said it will send a delegation to Iran “at the earliest possible date” in a bid to secure the release of a tanker seized in the Arabian Gulf, amid tensions surrounding the freezing of Iranian funds in Seoul because of US sanctions. Members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) seized the Korean-flagged MT Hankuk Chemi on Monday, detaining its 20-strong crew near the Strait of Hormuz amid allegations of pollution violations – a claim the ship’s operator rejects. The MT Hankuk Chemi, which is being held in the port city of Bandar Abbas, was traveling from Saudi Arabia to Fujairah on east coast of the United Arab Emirates. The international crew of the MT Hankuk Chemi, from Indonesia, Myanmar, South Korea, and Vietnam, are “safe and healthy,” the Yonhap news agency reported, citing the Iranian ambassador to Seoul. The ship was carrying 7,200 tons of “oil chemical products,” Iranian media quoting the IRGC said, adding that it was “seized due to the repeated infringement of maritime environmental laws,.” The report said the case “will be handed over to the judicial authorities of the country.” A South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman also said a planned trip to Tehran by the country’s Deputy Foreign Minister Choi Jong-Kun would still go ahead early next week, Iranian media Radio Farda reported on Wednesday. The spat comes as Iranian officials push for the release of billions of dollars, earned from oil sales made before Washington tightened sanctions, which are now frozen in South Korean banks. Iran denies allegations made that the seizure of the ship amounts to a hostage taking situation, the report added. “If anybody is to be called a hostage taker, it is the South Korean government that has taken our more than $7 billion hostage under a futile pretext,” Ali Rabiei was quoted as telling reporters. The US State Department had previously demanded the tanker’s immediate release, and accused Iran of threatening “navigational rights and freedoms” in the Arabian Gulf to “extort the international community into relieving the pressure” of economic sanctions, the report added. South Korea’s defense ministry meanwhile announced that members of the country’s anti-piracy unit had arrived in the area onboard a navy destroyer and are “carrying out a mission to ensure the safety of our nationals,” a spokesman explained. The ship’s seizure comes as tensions grow in the region during the first anniversary of the assassination of the IRGC’s Major General Qasem Soleimani. The US has already flown B-52 bombers over the region and sent a nuclear-powered submarine into the Gulf. Iran continues to reduce its compliance with the nuclear deal it reached with the US in 2015 under Barack Obama’s presidency, announcing on Jan. 4 that it had resumed 20 percent uranium enrichment at an underground facility.

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seized the Hankuk Chemi and arrested its multinational crew of 20 near the strategic Strait of Hormuz one week ago Iran warned Monday its seizure of a South Korean tanker in the Gulf must not be politicised, after the US and France urged the Islamic republic to release the ship. "We have repeatedly told... the intervening parties, whether they are the United States or France, that the case does not concern them at all and that they will not help to solve a technical problem if they politicise it," said foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seized the Hankuk Chemi and arrested its multinational crew of 20 near the strategic Strait of Hormuz one week ago.

News article:
Indonesia said on Sunday its coast guard had seized the Iranian-flagged MT Horse and the Panamanian-flagged MT Freya vessels over suspected illegal oil transfer in the country's waters Iran has asked Indonesia to provide details about the seizure of an Iranian-flagged vessel, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said on Monday, a day after Jakarta said it had seized Iran and Panama-flagged tankers in its waters. Indonesia said on Sunday its coast guard had seized the Iranian-flagged MT Horse and the Panamanian-flagged MT Freya vessels over suspected illegal oil transfer in the country's waters. Khatibzadeh said that the seizure was over a "a technical issue and it happens in shipping field". "Our Ports Organisation and the ship owner company are looking to find the cause of the issue and resolve it," Khatibzadeh told a televised weekly news conference. Coast guard spokesman Wisnu Pramandita said the tankers, seized in waters off Kalimantan province, will be escorted to Batam island in Riau Island Province for further investigation. "The tankers, first detected at 5:30 a.m. local time (2130 GMT on Jan. 23) concealed their identity by not showing their national flags, turning off automatic identification systems and did not respond to a radio call," Wisnu said in a statement on Sunday. Wisnu told Reuters on Monday that the ships were "caught red-handed" transferring oil from MT Horse to MT Freya and that there was an oil spill around the receiving tanker. He added that 61 crew members onboard the vessels were Iranian and Chinese nationals and had been detained. Indonesia's foreign and energy ministries did not immediately comment on the matter. The International Maritime Organization requires vessels to use transponders for safety and transparency. Crews can turn off the devices if there is a danger of piracy or similar hazards. But transponders are often shut down to conceal a ship's location during illicit activities. Both the supertankers, each capable of carrying 2 million barrels of oil, were last spotted earlier this month off Singapore, shipping data on Refinitiv Eikon showed. Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) MT Horse, owned by the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC), was almost fully loaded with oil while VLCC MT Freya, managed by Shanghai Future Ship Management Co, was empty, the data showed. NITC was not immediately available for comment. A search by Reuters on Chinese company directory found that the registered office address of Shanghai Future Ship Management Co came under another firm named Shanghai Chengda Ship Management. Several calls made to the office went unanswered. Iran has been accused of concealing the destination of its oil sales by disabling tracking systems on its tankers, making it difficult to assess how much crude Tehran exports as it seeks to counter U.S. sanctions. In 2018, former President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six major powers and reimposed sanctions aimed at cutting Tehran's oil exports to zero. Iran sent the MT Horse vessel to Venezuela last year to deliver 2.1 million barrels of Iranian condensate. Over the past few months, MT Freya has delivered two crude oil cargoes totalling about 4 million barrels into Qingdao port on the east coast of China and northeast Yingkou port, said Emma Li, a senior crude analyst with Refinitiv. The Qingdao cargo was declared as Upper Zakum crude produced in the United Arab Emirates, said Li, who tracks China-destined crude oil shipments. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Indonesia has seized an Iranian tanker which was caught red-handed illegally transferring oil to a vessel from Panama, according to the coast guard. The Iranian-flagged MT Horse and the Panamanian Freya were seized on Sunday in waters off Borneo and escorted to Batam Island for further investigation.

Iran sent the MT Horse vessel to Venezuela last year to deliver 2.1 million barrels of Iranian condensate. Over the past few months, MT Freya has delivered two crude oil cargoes totalling about 4 million barrels into Qingdao port on the east coast of China and northeast Yingkou port, said Emma Li, a senior crude analyst with Refinitiv. The Qingdao cargo was declared as Upper Zakum crude produced in the United Arab Emirates, said Li, who tracks China-destined crude oil shipments.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Wednesday it was seeking details about 25 of its nationals who were among 61 crew on two supertankers seized by Indonesia on suspicion of illegally transferring oil. Panamanian-flagged MT Freya tanker is escorted to Batam, Riau Islands, Indonesia January 26, 2021 in this still image taken from video. Indonesian Coast Guard (BAKAMLA)/Indonesian Navy (TNI AL)/Handout via REUTERS THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY. NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVES. MANDATORY CREDIT Indonesia said on Sunday it had seized the vessels after they were detected making the transfer from Iranian-flagged MT Horse to Panamanian-flagged MT Freya, causing an oil spill. The Indonesian authorities said the seizure was not related to U.S. sanctions, which Washington imposed in a bid to shut off Iran’s oil exports in a dispute over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The MT Horse, owned by the National Iranian Tanker Company, and MT Freya, managed by Shanghai Future Ship Management Co, were detected off Indonesia’s Kalimantan island. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said 25 of the crew members were Chinese, without saying whether the crew were all on one vessel or split between both. “Our embassy has expressed concern to Indonesia,” Zhao said. “We urged them to verify the situation about the Chinese seamen as soon as possible and inform us formally.” He said China called on Indonesia to conduct an investigation “fairly and in accordance with the law”. Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Teuku Faizasyah, told Reuters there had been “initial communication” with China and Iran, and said further discussion would depend on results from the investigation. Iran’s Foreign Ministry said on Monday the seizure of its tanker was over a technical issue and that it had asked Indonesia to provide more details. Iran has been accused of seeking to conceal the destination of its oil sales by disabling tracking systems on its tankers. The Indonesian authorities said the ships concealed their identity by not showing national flags, turning off automatic identification systems and failing to respond to a radio call. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) requires ships to use transponders for safety and transparency. Crews can turn off devices if there is a danger of piracy or similar hazards. “We welcome the Indonesian Coast Guard efforts to counter illicit maritime activity,” a U.S. embassy spokesman in Jakarta told Reuters, saying Washington supported efforts to ensure IMO standards for safety and environmental compliance were upheld.

DUBAI (Reuters) - A move by South Korea towards releasing $7 billion in frozen Iranian funds may help spur Iran’s judiciary to resolve the seizure of a Korean ship being held for alleged environmental pollution, a senior Iranian lawmaker said on Friday. Earlier this month South Korea’s vice foreign minister held talks in Tehran on the release of the South Korean-flagged MT Hankuk Chemi, which was seized on Jan. 4 by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards near the strategic Strait of Hormuz. “Although the Korean ship’s seizure was only due to environmental pollution..., Korean action in expediting the return of Iran’s blocked funds may affect the judiciary’s decision in resolving the ship’s seizure,” lawmaker Mojtaba Zolnour was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA. Zolnour, chairman of the Iranian parliament’s national security committee, spoke in a virtual meeting with the head of South Korean parliament’s foreign affairs and unification committee, IRNA said. Iran has denied allegations that the seizure of the tanker and its 20-member crew amounted to hostage-taking, and said it was Seoul that was holding the Iranian funds “hostage”. The freezing of some $7 billion of Iranian funds is linked to U.S. sanctions which Washington reimposed on Tehran in 2018 after then-President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.

News article:
CHICAGO: The US Justice Department on Wednesday accused the Iranian government of falsifying documents in an attempt to ship Iranian oil to China on a Greek-owned tanker, in violation of US sanctions A forfeiture complaint was filed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that the oil on Liberian-flagged vessel the M/T Achilleas was falsely described as originating in Iraq. US officials said that the oil had been transferred from several other ships to disguise its origins as part of a scheme by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its Quds Force to covertly ship it to international customers. “The forfeiture complaint filed today serves as a reminder that the IRGC and (Quds Force) continue to exert significant control over the sale of Iranian oil,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. “As we have demonstrated in the past, the department will deploy all tools at its disposal to ensure that the IRGC and (Quds Force) cannot use profits from the sale of Iranian oil to fund terrorism and other activities that threaten the safety and security of all Americans.” The complaint alleges that a number of entities worked together in an attempt to disguise the origin of the oil using ship-to-ship transfers, falsified documents and other means, and that a fraudulent bill of lading — a document detailing the contents of a shipment — was provided to deceive the owners of the Achilleas into accepting the oil. The complaint alleges in part that the oil is the property of, or a “source of influence” over, the IRGC and the Quds Force, both of which are designated by the US as foreign terrorist organizations. The court documents allege that profits from oil sales are used to support IRGC activities, including the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them, support for terrorism, and a variety of human-rights abuses at home and abroad. “The US Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia will continue working with our law-enforcement partners to stem the flow of illicit oil from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Quds Force,” said Acting US Attorney Michael R. Sherwin. “We will use all available tools, including our jurisdiction, to seize and forfeit assets located abroad, to combat funding for terrorists and those who would do harm to the US.” The FBI’s Minneapolis Field Office is leading the investigation into Iranian oil shipments. If the charges are upheld, the profits from the confiscated cargo will go to the US Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund. “Iran uses profits from its petroleum sector to fund the malign activities of the (Quds Force), a designated terrorist group,” said Michael F. Paul, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Minneapolis Field Office. “The FBI will continue to prioritize the enforcement of sanctions, and we applaud the efforts of our agents and partners on this investigation.” Peter C. Fitzhugh, special agent in charge of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in New York said the investigation sends the message that any attempted circumvention of US sanctions by the IRGC and its Quds Force will not be tolerated. “HSI will continue to work with our partners and utilize the full scope of our authorities to disrupt the attempts of hostile countries and regimes to generate profits from oil sales (that are) used to support terrorism and the proliferation and delivery of weapons of mass destruction,” he said.

The crew of a South Korean tanker seized by Iran are still on board the ship, Seoul said Thursday, despite Tehran announcing earlier this week it would release them in a humanitarian move. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seized the Hankuk Chemi and arrested its multinational crew of 20 sailors near the strategic Strait of Hormuz on January 4, saying it had polluted the waters. The development came as Tehran urged Seoul to release billions of dollars of Iranian assets frozen in South Korea due to US sanctions. On Tuesday, Iran's foreign ministry said the crew of the seized tanker had been granted permission to leave the country "in a humanitarian move", although it would retain the vessel and its captain. South Korean reports say the partial release complicates the situation as the ship needs personnel present to maintain it. All the crew members remained on board, Seoul's foreign ministry said Thursday, adding South Korean officials had been allowed to meet them Wednesday for the first time since the seizure. "The foreign ministry is discussing with the tanker company on the disembarkation and return of the crew and will put all efforts to secure the release of the captain and the ship as early as possible," it said in a statement. A representative at the tanker company DM Shipping said nothing was certain despite Tehran's announcement the crew would be released. "Discussions for their return are still ongoing," he told AFP. "It hasn't been decided whether they will return 100 percent." The arrested crew were from South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Myanmar. Former US president Donald Trump in 2018 withdrew Washington from a landmark nuclear agreement with world powers and then reimposed and reinforced crippling sanctions on Iran. Iran was a key oil supplier to resource-poor South Korea until Washington's rules blocked the purchases. According to government spokesman Ali Rabiei, Iran has $7 billion of funds blocked in Seoul. Tehran has repeatedly denied any link between the ship's seizure and the funds issue.

News article:
Iran has no knowledge of US plans to seize some two million barrels' worth of crude oil on board the Achilleas tanker, Deputy Oil Minister Amir Hossein Zamaninia has said. “I don’t know anything about it”, the deputy oil minister said while speaking to reporters in Tehran on Sunday, as cited by Bloomberg. Zamaninia’s comments come in the wake of a lawsuit filed by the DoJ last week charging that the tanker had been used by the Revolutionary Guards and its elite Quds Force formation (which the US designates as "terrorist organisations") to smuggle Iranian oil abroad and avoid crushing US restrictions. According to the complaint, Capital Ship Management Corp, the tanker’s Greece-based operator, appeared to have no knowledge about the oil’s true origins. The Achilleas was reportedly ordered to set course for the US shortly before Joe Biden’s inauguration as president last month. The forfeiture complaint, filed with the US District Court for the District of Columbia, claims that the ship carried out a ship-to-ship transfer of crude in October 2020 in the Gulf of Oman near the Emirati port of Fujairah. Officially, the ship was said to have been chartered to carry a cargo of Basrah light crude to China.

A photo released by the US Department of Justice shows the Bella oil tanker seized by the US. AFP file photo Asharq Al-Awsat The United States has sold more than a million barrels of Iranian fuel seized under its sanctions program last year, a Department of Justice official said, as another ship with intercepted Iranian crude oil sails to a US port. The seizures are part of Washington's tough economic sanctions on Tehran imposed over its nuclear program and the US designation of a number of Iranian groups as terrorists. In a new approach last year, the administration of former US President Donald Trump used civil forfeiture procedures to seize some 1.2 million barrels of gasoline it said were being sent from Iran to Venezuela aboard four tankers. Department of Justice spokesman Marc Raimondi told Reuters this week that the sale of the cargoes had been completed, adding that the government was "still working out the final expenses." "The petroleum has been seized, and an interlocutory sale has preserved the cash value of the petroleum, which is now held by the US Marshals Service" he said. The value of the gasoline was not known, but was likely worth tens of millions of dollars based on benchmark European gasoline prices. Raimondi said the department still needs the US District Court in Washington, DC, to enter an order of forfeiture "and then the funds will be transferred to the US Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund." Last week, the United States filed a lawsuit to seize another cargo, this one of crude oil it says came from Iran -rather than Iraq, as stated on the bill of lading - contravening US terrorism regulations. That cargo, loaded onto the Liberian-flagged Achilleas tanker, last reported its position in Caribbean waters. The US Gulf port of Galveston was its destination with a scheduled arrival on Feb. 15, Refinitiv ship tracking data showed on Wednesday.

News article:
Cairo- Mohammed Abdu Hassanein Egypt has been seeking to push Ethiopia to conclude a binding legal agreement that spares it the potential negative impact of the mega dam, which Addis Ababa is constructing on the Nile River. Cairo fears the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) would affect the flow of its annual share of the Nile’s 55.5 billion cubic meters of water especially that it relies on it for more than 90 percent of its water supplies. In a phone conversation with his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi stressed his country’s firm position on formulating a binding legal agreement that preserves Egyptian water rights and includes Sudan, Ethiopia, and Egypt. The agreement shall define the rules for filling and operating the dam while preserving Cairo’s water rights, he noted. The African Union has been sponsoring talks among Cairo, Addis Ababa, and Khartoum since July and attended by observers from the United States and the European Union. For nearly a decade, talks over the operation and filling of the mega-dam have faltered. The latest GERD meeting was held on Nov. 21 between Egypt and Ethiopia’s irrigation ministers. Sudan boycotted the talks, calling on the AU to change the negotiation’s approach and expand the role of experts. The ministers agreed to prepare separate reports, including their countries’ visions to advance the negotiations, and send them to South Africa’s Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Dr. Naledi Pandor. According to Presidential spokesman Bassam Rady, Sisi received a phone call from Ramaphosa during which both sides discussed and exchanged views on the issue. Ramaphosa praised Egypt’s efforts to reach a solution on this vital issue and called for coordination during the coming period to work on reaching a fair and balanced agreement. South Africa’s term ends at the end of 2020 and the Democratic Republic of the Congo will take over the AU presidency in 2021. On Saturday, Sisi also held a phone conversation with his Congolese counterpart Felix Tshisekedi during which they discussed regional and continental issues of mutual interest.

A handout satellite image shows a closeup view of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and the Blue Nile River in Ethiopia (Reuters) Cairo, Khartoum- Mohammed Abdu Hassanein and Mohammed Amin Yassine Sudan announced it was not attending the new round of talks on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), in a new setback for the negotiation process led by the African Union (AU). The AU called Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan for a one-week round of negotiations on January 3 to discuss the GERD issue, after talks had been suspended for a month. A six-way meeting was also scheduled for the end of the week between foreign and irrigation ministers of the three countries, chaired by South Africa, current AU president, to consider the outcomes of the tripartite negotiations round. The Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation announced that Ethiopia sent an invitation for the meeting, which was also meant to include irrigation ministers, technical and legal delegations, and AU observers and experts. However, Sudan announced its reservation over participation in the Tripartite Ministerial Meeting, requesting a bilateral meeting with the AU experts and observers. Sudan’s Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources explained in a statement that it did not receive a response to its request, but received an invitation to resume the direct tripartite negotiations. “Instead of a reply to this request, Sudan received an invitation for a direct tripartite meeting, so it has expressed its reservations over participating in this meeting.” Khartoum reiterated its firm position on the necessity of giving a greater role to the Union experts to facilitate negotiations. Egypt agreed with Ethiopia to raise the matter to the South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, so that future steps will be discussed during the ministerial meeting, scheduled for January 10. The three countries have been engaged in strenuous negotiations for about 10 years to agree on mechanisms for operating and filling the dam, without yielding any results so far. Cairo and Khartoum want to reach an agreement before the second phase of filling the reservoir in a way that achieves the common interests of the three countries and secures Egypt's rights and water interests. Addis Ababa finished last July the first phase of filling the reservoir, in preparation for its operation, and the second phase is expected to begin next June. The negotiations are held with the participation of experts and observers from the US, EU, World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the African Union.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia on Saturday summoned the U.S. ambassador over what it called an “incitement of war” between Ethiopia and Egypt from President Donald Trump over their dispute about the filling and operation of a massive hydropower dam. Slideshow ( 2 images ) Trump called on Friday for an agreement between the countries, but added it was a dangerous situation and that Cairo could end up “blowing up that dam”. Ethiopian Foreign Affairs Minister Gedu Andargachew summoned U.S. Ambassador to Addis Ababa Mike Raynor to seek clarifications on the comments. “The incitement of war between Ethiopia and Egypt from a sitting U.S. president neither reflects the longstanding partnership and strategic alliance between Ethiopia and the United States nor is acceptable in international law governing interstate relations,” Gedu’s ministry said in a statement. Trump made the comments during a call with Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok following Sudan and Israel’s announcement to normalise ties. Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt have been locked in a bitter dispute over the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which remains unresolved although the reservoir behind the dam began filling in July. Trump said on Friday he had brokered an agreement to resolve the issue but that Ethiopia had broken the pact, forcing him to cut funds, adding: “They will never see that money unless they adhere to the agreement ... You can’t blame Egypt for being a little upset.” He said he had also urged Egypt to resolve the dispute. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s office said earlier on Saturday: “Occasional statements of belligerent threats to have Ethiopia succumb to unfair terms still abound.” The first phase of filling the dam was completed in August, it said. Egypt says it is dependent on the Nile for more than 90% of its scarce fresh water supplies, and fears the dam could have a devastating effect on its economy. Abiy’s office said there had been significant progress made in resolving the dispute since the African Union took over the negotiations. “Now is the time for action and not for increasing tensions,” European Union’s European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said before the Ethiopian ministry issued its statement.

News article:
Khartoum insists on granting bigger role for experts participating in the talks as well as reaching a comprehensive and binding agreement The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) negotiations between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia are scheduled to resume on Sunday under the aegis of the African Union (AU), along with the participation of each country’s foreign and irrigation ministers. Sunday’s gathering is expected to look into Sudan’s absence from last week's talks and review the coming steps of the long-running standoff, which has been of concern to Cairo and Khartoum since 2011. Sudan skipped the meeting, according to an official statement released last week, in objection to not receiving a response to its demands of holding bilateral meetings between the AU experts participating in the negotiations and each of the three countries' representatives separately to discuss and identify points of differences while continuing to hold only trilateral meetings between the three countries' negotiating teams. The AU-mediated talks have been observed by representatives from the EU, the US, the AU, as well as legal and technical experts. Only 24 hours before Sunday's six-member meeting, Sudan called for the AU to play a leading and more effective role in the negotiations, which the continental body has been mediating. The call came during a meeting held on Saturday between the Sudanese negotiating team and the AU experts' team participating in the talks that are being held. During the bilateral meeting, the Sudanese side called for granting experts a bigger role and establishing a clear frame of reference for their role, the Sudanese official news agency SUNA reported. Sudan affirmed the need for the AU to “play a leading” and “effective” role more than it had been doing during the previous rounds of negotiations, SUNA added. The team reiterated the necessity of reaching a comprehensive and binding agreement on the rule of filling and operating the dam, that includes clear mechanisms for settling potential disputes. The Sudanese government warned that it would withdraw from Sunday's meeting if its demand of granting a bigger role for experts will not be met, the Saudi-owned new website Asharq reported, citing Sudanese diplomatic sources. The GERD, built 15 kilometres from the Ethiopian border with Sudan, has been a source of contention between the three countries since its construction began in 2011. Cairo fears the project will significantly cut its crucial water supplies from the River Nile, while Sudan has concerns over how the reservoir will be managed. Ethiopia says the massive project - which it hopes will make it Africa’s largest power exporter - is key to its development efforts. Search Keywords: Short link:

Sudan reiterated the necessity of reaching a legally binding agreement on the rules for filling and operating the near-complete dam to preserve the interests of all three nations Khartoum has said it "will not accept the imposition of a fait accompli policy" in the dispute caused by the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), referring to Ethiopia's intention to embark on the second filling of the dam's reservoir in July despite a lack of agreement with downstream countries Egypt and Sudan. Prime Minister Abdullah Hamdok and the Sudanese higher committee for following up on the GERD developments held a meeting on Monday, where it was stated that risking the safety of 20 million Sudanese whose lives rely on the Blue Nile is unacceptable. The meeting reiterated Sudan’s stance on the necessity of reaching a legally binding agreement on the rules for filling and operating the near-complete dam to preserve the interests of all three nations, Sudanese news agency SUNA reported. Also, the meeting dealt with the potential hazards of Ethiopia's anticipated step to start the second filling of the dam in July without reaching an agreement. The meeting highlighted the consequences of this step, if it happens, on the safety of the operation of the Sudanese Roseires Dam, which is located close to the GERD, and other water facilities in the country. In a step that angered Sudan and Egypt, Addis Ababa declared last summer that it had achieved the first-year filling (4.9 billion cubic metres) during the rainy season flooding of the Blue Nile. Days following the move by Ethiopia, Sudan announced that it had recorded a decline in water levels on the Blue Nile coming from Ethiopia. Both downstream countries have repeatedly reiterated their rejection of taking any unilateral action without reaching a binding agreement. Khartoum and Cairo have been in talks with Addis Ababa for a decade to reach a legally binding agreement on the filling and operating of the $4.8 billion mega-dam, which has been under construction on the Blue Nile since 2011. The Sudanese remarks come almost two weeks after Sudanese Irrigation Minister Yasser Abbas sent a letter to the African Union (AU), the current mediator of the dam negotiations, expressing his country’s grave concerns over Addis Ababa's announcement that it would go on with the second filling of the GERD in the summer of 2021. Monday's talks, attended by Sudan's cabinet members and directors of the General Intelligence Service and Military Intelligence, came a week after the latest round of GERD talks failed to resolve the differences between the three countries. The talks tackled alternative options after the halt of the AU negotiations, according to SUNA. The last round of negotiations came to a standstill over Sudan’s withdrawal due to its rejection of the methodology upon which the negotiations were held, calling for a bigger role by the experts assigned by the AU to reconcile opinions instead of the direct trilateral talks.

News article:
Sudan has kicked off intense diplomatic efforts to resume the stalled negotiations on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. (Reuters) Khartoum - Mohammed Amin Yassin Sudan has kicked off intense diplomatic efforts to resume the stalled negotiations on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) to mobilize regional and international support for its position. Sudanese Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Yasir Abbas held three separate meetings with the ambassadors of the UK, France and Russia to Khartoum. He briefed them on the latest developments in the negotiations in the past six months and his country’s stance, which calls for resolving disputes through serious dialogue. Sudanese officials are also expected to tour some regional countries to garner support for their position. The British Ambassador, Irfan Siddiq, vowed to help the three countries involved – Sudan, Ethiopia and Egypt - reach a satisfactory agreement. Khartoum has hinted it would resort to alternative options since talks for nearly a decade over the operation and filling of the mega-dam have faltered. Meanwhile, Sudan’s High Committee to follow up on the GERD met Monday to discuss the threats posed by the dam’s second filling and its impact on the safety and operation of the nearby Roseires dam and other water facilities. Headed by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, the committee stressed that it will not accept the de facto policy, which threatens its citizens and water installations on the Blue Nile. Ethiopia is determined to fill the reservoir with 13.5 million cubic meters of water in July, whether an agreement is reached or not. It had first filled the reservoir in 2020. Sudanese officials have expressed their disappointment with the African Union mediation in the dispute, which has made little progress since taking over the file in July 2020. They highlighted the difficulties faced by the AU in persuading Cairo and Addis Ababa to respond to Khartoum’s request to expand the role of experts to bridge divides between the countries. The three Nile Valley countries agree on the importance of reaching an agreement on the GERD, but there are some obstacles that hinder achieving this goal, an official source told Asharq Al-Awsat. He cited the upcoming elections in Ethiopia as one such obstacle. The official further explained that Sudan’s alternative options are mainly its latest diplomatic moves and contacts with Addis Ababa and Cairo. These moves will lead to positive pressure that will help overcome the disputes, he stressed, adding that his country does not oppose any proposal on expanding the role of African experts chosen by the AU.

Sudan has kicked off intense diplomatic efforts to resume the stalled negotiations on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. (Reuters) Khartoum - Mohammed Amin Yassin Sudan has kicked off intense diplomatic efforts to resume the stalled negotiations on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) to mobilize regional and international support for its position. Sudanese Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Yasir Abbas held three separate meetings with the ambassadors of the UK, France and Russia to Khartoum. He briefed them on the latest developments in the negotiations in the past six months and his country’s stance, which calls for resolving disputes through serious dialogue. Sudanese officials are also expected to tour some regional countries to garner support for their position. The British Ambassador, Irfan Siddiq, vowed to help the three countries involved – Sudan, Ethiopia and Egypt - reach a satisfactory agreement. Khartoum has hinted it would resort to alternative options since talks for nearly a decade over the operation and filling of the mega-dam have faltered. Meanwhile, Sudan’s High Committee to follow up on the GERD met Monday to discuss the threats posed by the dam’s second filling and its impact on the safety and operation of the nearby Roseires dam and other water facilities. Headed by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, the committee stressed that it will not accept the de facto policy, which threatens its citizens and water installations on the Blue Nile. Ethiopia is determined to fill the reservoir with 13.5 million cubic meters of water in July, whether an agreement is reached or not. It had first filled the reservoir in 2020. Sudanese officials have expressed their disappointment with the African Union mediation in the dispute, which has made little progress since taking over the file in July 2020. They highlighted the difficulties faced by the AU in persuading Cairo and Addis Ababa to respond to Khartoum’s request to expand the role of experts to bridge divides between the countries. The three Nile Valley countries agree on the importance of reaching an agreement on the GERD, but there are some obstacles that hinder achieving this goal, an official source told Asharq Al-Awsat. He cited the upcoming elections in Ethiopia as one such obstacle. The official further explained that Sudan’s alternative options are mainly its latest diplomatic moves and contacts with Addis Ababa and Cairo. These moves will lead to positive pressure that will help overcome the disputes, he stressed, adding that his country does not oppose any proposal on expanding the role of African experts chosen by the AU.

News article:
NAIROBI (Reuters) - Ethiopia warned Sudan on Tuesday it was running out of patience with its neighbour’s continued military build-up in a disputed border area despite attempts to diffuse tensions with diplomacy. The decades-old dispute over al-Fashqa, land within Sudan’s international boundaries that has long been settled by Ethiopian farmers, erupted into weeks of clashes between forces from both sides late last year. “The Sudanese side seems to be pushing in so as to inflame the situation on the ground,” Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesman Dina Mufti told reporters. “Is Ethiopia going to start a war? Well, we are saying let’s work on diplomacy.” “How long will Ethiopia continue to resolve the issue using diplomacy? Well, there is nothing that has no limit. Everything has a limit,” he told a briefing in Addis Ababa. Sudan’s information minister and government spokesman Feisal Mohamed Saleh said the country did not want war with Ethiopia but its forces would respond to any aggression. “We fear that these comments contain a hostile position towards Sudan. We ask of Ethiopia to stop attacking Sudanese territory and Sudanese farmers,” he told Reuters. Sudan said on Dec. 31 that it had taken control of all of Sudanese territory in the area. Ethiopia says Sudan took advantage of its forces being distracted by the Tigray conflict to occupy Ethiopian land and loot properties. The United Nations said in a report last week on the humanitarian situation in Tigray that there were reports of a military build-up on both sides of the border around the area. The border tensions come at a time when Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt are also trying to resolve a three-way row over Ethiopia’s Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Ethiopia sees the dam as key to plans to become Africa’s largest power exporter. Egypt, which gets more than 90% of its scarce fresh water from the Nile, fears the dam across the Blue Nile could devastate its economy. Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan said on Sunday that they reached a new impasse in the dispute. Egypt and Ethiopia separately blamed Sudanese objections to the framework for the talks. On Tuesday, Ethiopia’s Dina criticised both Egypt and Sudan for delaying the negotiations. “Are the two speaking the same language? More or less. The two are speaking the same language when it comes to stalling it.”

News article:
Cairo - Mohammed Abdo Hassanein Egypt has continued its international diplomatic efforts to move forward the stalled talks on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), hoping to pressure Ethiopia to reach a legally binding agreement on regulating the dam’s filling and operation. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi received on Tuesday his Congolese counterpart Felix Tshisekedi, the next president of the African Union (AU), which has been sponsoring talks between Cairo, Khartoum and Addis Ababa since July 2020. According to presidential spokesperson Bassam Rady, they discussed the latest regional developments, especially the GERD issue, and agreed to bolster coordination and joint consultation. Sisi highlighted Egypt’s position that “the Nile River is a source of cooperation and development and a lifeline that links peoples of the Nile Basin countries.” Leaders held individual discussions followed by expanded discussions between both countries’ delegations, the presidential statement noted. The statement quoted Tshisekedi as expressing appreciation for the distinguished historic relations with Egypt and the sincere and firm Egyptian political support for Congo. He stressed his country’s keenness to develop these relations in various fields, especially trade and economic cooperation. Meanwhile, the Egyptian embassy in Washington held on Monday an expanded virtual session with Congress aides from the House and Senate. During the session, Ambassador Motaz Zahran reviewed the GERD’s “negative impact” on Egypt and Sudan’s water security. Cairo is not opposed to Ethiopia's right to development, provided that its aspirations do not affect Egyptian interests and water security, Zahran stressed. The meeting aims to provide an accurate explanation to Congress members on Egypt’s stance on the negotiations. Cairo and Khartoum stress the need to reach a binding and comprehensive agreement that guarantees the rights and interests of the three countries, and include a mechanism for settling disputes filling and operation of the dam. They fear the potential negative impact of GERD on the flow of their annual share of the Nile’s 55.5 billion cubic meters of water. The GERD dispute has taken two courses of so far faltered negotiations. The first was mediated by the US, the World Bank and European Union observers in early 2020 and the second by the AU.

News article:
Sudan has recently started to state clearly that a legally binding solution is the only way out of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) crisis and Khartoum will not accept a second filling of the dam in the absence of an agreement, noted a diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity. He added that “Addis Ababa has always found a reason for procrastination and will use its current internal problems in the Tigray region together with mounting tension with Sudan” to continue along the same path, despite Khartoum’s position growing closer to Cairo’s. That Sudan had now joined Egypt in stating unequivocally that a legally binding agreement is the only way out of the dam impasse is unlikely to shift Addis Ababa’s position, says Abbas Sharaki, professor of geology and water resources at Cairo University. For that to happen, he argues, Egypt and Sudan need to unify their stand across the dam file. Egypt also reiterated its position on the dam this week when President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi repeated Cairo’s longstanding position that a legally-binding agreement is needed to resolve the crisis during a meeting in Cairo with the chairperson of the African Union (AU) Commission Moussa Faki. Faki was in Egypt to exchange views with Cairo on a range of African issues, including the upcoming AU Summit scheduled for 6 and 7 February, and the commission’s leadership elections which will be held on the periphery of the summit. Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri held a separate meeting with Faki during which he stressed Egypt’s continued willingness to engage in serious negotiations in order to reach a legally binding agreement, provided it is matched by a similar commitment on the Ethiopian side. Speaking to the newly-elected House of Representatives last week about the latest developments over GERD, Shoukri underlined that Egypt will not allow anyone to impose de facto policies or control the Nile. He told MPs that Cairo had managed to involve the international community in the dam file, one result of which was the unprecedented UN Security Council session in June 2020 addressing the dispute. Last week, Sudan’s acting Foreign Minister Omar Qamareddin told the media that “a binding agreement that regulates the filling and operating of the dam is a must,” a position that Khartoum is increasingly keen to explain to the world. Last week, it held a series of meetings with foreign ambassadors in Khartoum, including representatives of UN Security Council permanent member states. Continuing the diplomatic push, this week Sudan’s Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Yasser Abbas met the German and Spanish ambassadors to Khartoum. Late last month, Abbas and Qamareddin visited the Congolese capital Kinshasa where they met with Felix Antoine Cheskidy, president of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The DRC will take over the chairmanship of the AU from South Africa during this weekend’s AU summit. During their meeting, the Sudanese officials said Khartoum was ready to continue with the AU-mediated tripartite negotiations. Cheskidy, in turn, said he would discuss the issue with Egypt and Ethiopia in an attempt to close the gap between the three parties. Political analysts question whether the Congo can succeed in pushing forward a deal on the dam, something South Africa failed to do during last year’s AU-mediated talks. Sharaki is far from optimistic, not least because “the AU lacks a strong mechanism to impose its resolutions its member states.” Hani Raslan, an expert on African affairs at Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, argues that however differently Congo manages the file it is unlikely to lead to an agreement. “Ethiopia has already rejected the mediation of the World Bank and the US. What we now need is concerted international pressure, from the US and influential European states, especially those involved in the building of the dam, like Italy and the UK. If the international will is there, Addis Ababa will have to respond,” says Raslan. Sudan withdrew twice from the AU-mediated talks called by South Africa, demanding a greater role for AU experts in mediating the dispute, and claiming the current negotiating approach had rendered the talks redundant. Although both Egypt and Sudan have said repeatedly they cannot accept a second filling before an agreement is reached, Addis Ababa insists it will go ahead and fill the reservoir this summer regardless of whether an agreement is in place. Ethiopia’s Irrigation Minister Selshi Bekele tweeted this week that “construction progresses as scheduled. Support of Ethiopians for GERD at home and abroad is at its climax. We shall deliver this clean energy for the prosperity of Ethiopia and Africa.” The first filling of the dam’s reservoir took place last summer despite the absence of a binding agreement, a move that angered Cairo and Khartoum, both of whom saw it as a violation of the Declaration of Principles (DoP) signed in Sudan in March 2015. The DoP states that the three countries must first agree on guidelines and rules for the operating processes of the dam before filling the reservoir. The dam, 15km from the Ethiopian border with Sudan, has been a source of contention between the three countries since construction began in 2011. *A version of this article appears in print in the 4 February , 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
(Adds details, background) By Khalid Abdelaziz KHARTOUM, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Any unilateral step by Ethiopia to fill its hydropower project, called the Renaissance Dam, in July would directly threaten Sudan's national security, Sudanese Irrigation and Water Resources Minister Yasser Abbas said on Saturday. Sudan is also proposing a mediation role for the United States, European Union, United Nations and African Union as a way of breaking the deadlock in talks about the dam between Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia, Abbas told Reuters in an interview. His comments come at a time of increased tension between Sudan and Ethiopia over disputed farmland near their shared border. This is on top of tension over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which Ethiopia is building on the Blue Nile, close to the border with Sudan. Ethiopia began filling the reservoir behind the dam after the summer rains last year despite demands from Egypt and Sudan that it should first reach a binding agreement on the dam's operation. Egypt views the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam as a major threat to its fresh water supplies, more than 90% of which come from the Nile. The Blue Nile flows north into Sudan then Egypt and is the Nile's main tributary. Ethiopia says the dam is crucial to its economic development. "The filling of the Renaissance Dam by one side next July represents a direct threat to Sudan's national security," said Abbas. He said unilateral filling of the reservoir threatened electricity generation from Sudan's Merowe Dam and Roseires Dam, as well as the safety of the Roseires Dam and of 20 million Sudanese living downstream of the GERD. Sudanese drinking water stations could also be put at risk, he added. The African Union has convened recent negotiations over the GERD between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt but talks have repeatedly stalled. Talks hosted by the United States last year also failed to secure a deal. "Sudan is now leading a diplomatic and political campaign to clarify its position and reach a legal and binding solution," Abbas said. "We are optimistic that if there is political will, a mutually agreed solution can be reached."

News article:
Any unilateral step by Ethiopia to fill its Dam in July would directly threaten Sudan's national security, Sudanese Irrigation and Water Resources Minister Yasser Abbas said Sudan warned Ethiopia Saturday against going ahead with the second phase of filling its mega dam on the Blue Nile, saying it would pose a "direct threat to Sudanese national security". "If Ethiopia goes ahead with filling the renaissance dam next July, this will be a direct threat to our national security," Sudan's Water Minister Yasser Abbas told AFP in an interview in the capital Khartoum. "It will also threaten the lives of half the population in central Sudan, as well as irrigation water for agricultural projects and power generation from (Sudan's) Roseires Dam." Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia have been locked in inconclusive talks for nearly a decade over the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, after Addis Ababa broke ground on the project in 2011. Ethiopia, which says it has already reached its first-year target for filling the dam's reservoir, has recently signalled it would proceed with the filling regardless of whether a deal was struck. Khartoum hopes the dam will regulate annual flooding, but fears that its own dams, including the Roseires and Merowe, would be harmed if no agreement is reached. "It will be impossible to operate the Roseires Dam without a binding agreement and daily exchange of information on the amount of water flowing from the renaissance dam," Abbas said. Without a deal, the minister added, the "Merowe Dam will also lose 30 percent of the electric energy it generates and drinking water stations will be affected". Sudan has suggested mediation by the United Nations, the African Union, the European Union and the United States to help break the impasse. The latest three-way talks were held last month in the presence of observers from the African Union and European Union, but failed to make headway. Relations between Addis Ababa and Khartoum have been sour in recent weeks following tensions over the Al-Fashaqa border region, where Ethiopian farmers cultivate fertile land claimed by Sudan. The Nile, the world's longest river, is a lifeline supplying both water and electricity to the 10 countries it traverses. Its main tributaries, the White and Blue Nile, converge in Khartoum before flowing north through Egypt to drain into the Mediterranean Sea. Search Keywords: Short link:

Source: Xinhua| 2021-02-07 03:58:43|Editor: huaxia Video Player Close CAIRO, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi expressed confidence on Saturday in the African Union's (AU) efforts aimed at reaching an agreement on the disputed Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). Sisi made the remarks during the two-day virtual 34th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the AU, which kicked off on Saturday, Egyptian Presidential Spokesman Bassam Rady said in a statement.

Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam is seen as it undergoes construction work on the Nile River in Guba Woreda, Benishangul Gumuz Region, Ethiopia, Sept. 26, 2019. (Reuters) Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat Ethiopia is rapidly advancing in building the Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile, in clear defiance of Egypt’s warnings that require a binding agreement on the rules of filling and operating the dam to avoid an expected shortfall in its water share. The construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) has reached 78.3 percent, a jump from 74 percent in June 2020, according to Ethiopia’s Ministry of Water, Energy and Irrigation. In a press briefing on Sunday, Minister of Water, Irrigation, and Energy Sileshi Bekele said the performance attained during the past six months is the fastest since the commencement of construction in 2011. Authorities started filling the reservoir on July 21, 2020. However, the completion of the first filling phase prior to reaching an agreement with Egypt and Sudan irked both countries. The dam is expected to hold 13.5 billion cubic meters of water in the upcoming rainy season, said Bekele, adding that of the total 13 power generating turbines, two will also start production during the same period. Cairo and Khartoum stress the need to reach a binding and comprehensive agreement that guarantees the rights and interests of the three countries, and includes a mechanism for settling disputes on filling and operation of the dam. They fear the potential negative impact of GERD on the flow of their annual share of the Nile’s 55.5 billion cubic meters of water. In television statements on Saturday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi stressed that his country is “fighting in the negotiations to protect the Egyptian people’s rights.” “Patience will bring the desired results,” he added. The African Union (AU) has been sponsoring the so far faltered talks between Cairo, Addis Ababa and Khartoum since July 2020, despite the intervention of international actors such as the United States and the European Union with observers. Egypt hopes the new AU leadership would push forward the stalled talks. Sisi stressed his country’s keenness to resolve the issue through “serious negotiations to enhance regional security, stability and development.” Saturday marked the official beginning of the year-long AU chairmanship of Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, who is replacing Cyril Ramaphosa. Last week, Tshisekedi visited Cairo, pledged to resume the GERD negotiations under the AU’s umbrella immediately, and expressed confidence that peaceful talks would lead to consensual “outcomes”.

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam as it appears in a satellite image taken on July 20, 2020 (AFP) Cairo - Mohammed Abdo Hassanein Ethiopia stressed on Thursday its keenness to solve differences with Egypt over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), weeks after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on the operation and filling of the mega-dam. Ethiopian Ambassador to Cairo Markos Tekle held talks Thursday with Egypt’s Assistant Foreign Minister for African Affairs, Sherif Issa. He explained Ethiopia’s longstanding position on the GERD negotiations and said the country was willing to resolve the remaining differences among the parties “through talks.” Issa expressed Egypt’s commitment to hold talks on GERD, according to the Ethiopian Embassy in Cairo. The meeting has also deliberated on bilateral relations, and the two sides exchanged views on the implementation of initiatives aimed at strengthening the historic relationship between Cairo and Addis Ababa. Last month, the African Union-sponsored talks to reach a fair and balanced agreement between Cairo, Addis Ababa and Khartoum over the operation and filling of the mega-dam faltered. Egypt has called GERD an existential threat and worries that it will reduce the country’s share of Nile waters. Ethiopia says the 145-meter tall dam will be an engine of development and is vital to meet the power needs of its population. Sudan, in the middle, worries about the effects on its own dams, although it stands to benefit from access to cheap electricity. The Blue Nile, which meets the White Nile in the Sudanese capital, provides the great majority of the combined Nile’s flow through northern Sudan and Egypt to the Mediterranean.

Cairo- Mohammed Abdu Hassanein Egypt has warned Ethiopia against filling the Renaissance Dam it is building on the Blue Nile before reaching a binding and legal agreement on the filling and operation process. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said Sunday that his country is ready to launch a new serious negotiation process that takes into account the interests of Cairo, Khartoum, and Addis Ababa. Ethiopia has been building the dam on the main tributary of the Nile since 2011, and its Ministry of Water, Irrigation, and Energy announced the completion of about 78 percent of the construction so far. Last week, it announced the dam is expected to hold 13.5 billion cubic meters of water in the upcoming rainy season. Authorities started filling the reservoir on July 21, 2020. However, the completion of the first filling phase prior to reaching an agreement with Egypt and Sudan irked both countries. Cairo has been seeking through intense diplomatic efforts to receive international support for its position against Addis Ababa’s. On Sunday, Shoukry received a phone call from Finnish Foreign Affairs Minister Pekka Haavisto, during which he affirmed that his country “had hoped for the success of the African Union (AU) efforts in resolving the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam’s (GERD) issue.” The AU-sponsored talks between Cairo, Addis Ababa, and Khartoum over the operation and filling of the mega-dam have faltered and were stalled in January, despite the intervention of international actors such as the United States and the European Union with observers. Shoukry expressed his country’s aspirations to resume talks under the AU's new chairmanship of Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi. “The Egyptian state has expressed its political determination to reach a fair and balanced agreement that achieves Ethiopia’s development goals while preserving Egypt’s rights and protecting the two downstream countries from the dam’s potential dangers,” a foreign ministry statement read. Addis Ababa refuses to legalize any agreement reached, which binds it to specific measures to alleviate the drought.

A view of Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam as it undergoes construction work on the river Nile in Guba Woreda, Benishangul Gumuz Region, Ethiopia. (Reuters) Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt said Wednesday it has endorsed a Sudanese proposal to internationalize arbitration in a years-long dispute with Ethiopia over a massive dam Addis Ababa is building on the Blue Nile. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said Cairo backs the formation of an “international quartet” including the US, the European Union, and the UN, along with the African Union to facilitate reaching a deal on the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopia Renaissance Dam. The dispute centers on how much water Ethiopia will release downstream if a multi-year drought occurs and how the three countries would settle any future disputes. Egypt and Sudan also call for a legally binding agreement on the dam’s filling and operation, while Ethiopia insists on guidelines. Shoukry said Egypt wants to develop the negotiating mechanism to reach a “legally binding agreement” at the earliest possible opportunity.” He announced Egypt’s position during a meeting Wednesday in Cairo with Alphonse Ntumba Luaba, the coordination of Democratic Republic of the Congo’s current leadership of the African Union. There were no immediate comments from Washington, Brussels, or the UN. Sudan has announced its proposal earlier this year after AU-led talks failed to achieve progress. Since then, Khartoum has become vocal against Ethiopia’s plans to start the second filling during the next rainy season. Prime Minister Abddalla Hamdok said earlier this month that the dam threatens at least 20 million Sudanese, roughly half the country’s population. Sudan wants Ethiopia to coordinate and share data on dam’s operation to avoid flooding and protect its own power-generating dams on the Blue Nile, the main tributary of the Nile River. The Blue Nile meets with the White Nile in central Sudan from where the Nile winds northward through Egypt and flows into the Mediterranean Sea. There was no comment from Ethiopia that had left a US-led attempt to mediate the dispute, alleging bias. The administration of former President Donald Trump last year sanctioned Ethiopia over the dam’s first filling before reaching a deal with Egypt and Sudan. On Friday, President Joe Biden's administration said it has de-linked the sanctions from the dam dispute. About 85 percent of the Nile's flow originates from Ethiopia. Officials hope the dam, now more than three-quarters complete, will reach full power-generating capacity in 2023, helping pull millions of its people out of poverty. Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous country with over 100 million people, called the dam an existential threat and worries that it would reduce its share of Nile waters. The country relies almost entirely on the Nile to supply water for agriculture and its people.

Cairo- Asharq Al-Awsat The United States Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, confirmed that the US is looking forward to deepening the economic partnership with Egypt, in a way that contributes to increasing US investments in the country that enjoys attractive climate and strong infrastructure. Mnuchin added, Wednesday, that they look forward to strengthening joint bilateral cooperation in combating money laundering operations that threaten world economies. This came during a meeting between Egyptian Finance Minister Mohamed Maait with Mnuchin and his accompanying delegation. Mnuchin praised the success of the economic reform program, which contributed to strengthening the structure of the Egyptian economy and containing the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Egyptian Ministry of Finance statement. Mnuchin emphasized that it is an important and unique experience that has given the Egyptian economy strength and rigidity in the face of internal and external crises and challenges, welcoming the Minister of Finance's keenness to transfer its expertise in the field of economic reform to neighboring countries. “We expect the global economic conditions to gradually improve, and the strong performance of the Egyptian economy will return after the provision of the coronavirus vaccine at the international level during the coming period,” he said. Mnuchin welcomed the flourishing bilateral trade and investment relations between the US and Egypt, noting that he looked forward to their recovering to pre-pandemic levels in the near future. He added that his country looks forward to strengthening economic cooperation between the two countries and attracting more American companies and investments to expand their economic activities in Egyptian markets, especially after the success of the economic reform program in improving the investment climate. For his part, Maait expressed the Egyptian government’s aspiration to maximize the investment activities of US companies in the country. He added that this would ensure a greater role for the US business sector in Egypt’s major development projects implemented in various parts of the country. Maait said: “We are ready to remove any obstacles to increase the investments of American companies in Egypt, especially that Egypt is qualified to be a regional center for the expansion of companies in the Middle East and Africa."

Cairo- Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt’s Nasr Automotive Manufacturing Company, of the Ministry of Public Enterprise, signed two agreements with China's Dongfeng Motor Corporation to reconstruct its factory to produce the first electric car in Egypt. Egypt’s Public Enterprise Minister Hisham Tawfik and the Chinese Ambassador to Cairo Liao Liqiang attended the online ceremony, which also included top officials from Nasr and Dongfeng. Speaking at the ceremony, Tawfiq stressed that the agreements mark the launch of Nasr towards the project of localizing the electric car industry in Egypt. Earlier, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi issued directives to relevant authorities on localizing and using national capabilities to manufacture electric vehicles. Tawfik explained that the project aims to preserve the environment by reducing dependence on fossil fuels and thermal emissions that have negative impacts on people and the economy. He explained that the agreements included a framework agreement for the production of the electric car in Nasr factories in cooperation with Dongfeng. Dongfeng is one of the four largest car manufacturers in China that produces about 3.5 million cars annually with its main partners in the auto industry worldwide, he mentioned. The two companies also signed an agreement to renew the Nasr factory with the latest technologies and production methods. The project comes within the framework of the automobile manufacturing strategy adopted by the political leadership, which takes into account all the associated factors, according to the Minister. Tawfik indicated that all relevant authorities and ministries are cooperating to ensure the success of this strategic project. They will deploy fast chargers in the streets and parking lots all over the country and prepare electricity networks to accommodate the expected increase in consumption. The authorities will also launch the necessary support policies which help encourage consumers to shift to new methods of transportation. He pointed out that the ministry relied on technical and commercial studies which led to choosing China’s Dongfeng, as well as the “E70” model. E70 electric vehicles will be used to reduce emissions and ensure successful sustainability while keeping pace with the increasing global trend of electric transport. In light of the President’s directives, Nasr Company will start its production of electric cars at a localization rate of 50 percent. At a later stage, the plan will include a research and development center, with the participation of national cadres and specialized Egyptian companies. An agreement is currently underway to establish a research and development center with Dongfeng and Egyptآ's Brightskies Technologies company. The Minister also reported that the project aims to produce 25,000 cars annually in one shift, and according to market studies, the volume of demand is expected to increase with the anticipated governmental support and incentives to double this amount.

Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt’s Minister of Trade and Industry Nevine Gamea affirmed Egypt’s full economic support to Sudan during its transitional period. During her visit to Khartoum on Thursday, the minister said that Egypt’s business community welcomes the setting up of partnerships with their Sudanese counterpart. This would come in accordance with the industrial and infrastructure projects that Sudan is targeting during the coming period. The session was held on the sidelines of Gamea’s visit to Sudan to represent Egypt in the 38th round of the Khartoum International Expo. Egypt is planning to establish an industrial zone in Sudan to facilitate the set-up of joint projects. The strategy will be implemented by the private sector to boost the economic integration between the two sides. Gamea announced during an extended discussion in Khartoum with Minister of Trade and Industry Abbas Madany and Minister of State for Infrastructure and Transport Hashim Ibnauf. The Egyptian minister called on Sudan to hold the joint trade committee in Cairo to discuss the technical aspects regarding the trade flow between the two countries, noting that trade between Egypt and Sudan recorded $862 million in 2020. She added that Egypt’s exports to Sudan amounted to $496 million, while Egypt’s imports from Sudan recorded $366 billion in 2020. Chemicals, processed products, machines, foodstuffs, textiles, transport means, livestock, and agricultural products are the main traded goods, according to Gamea. The two sides discussed ways for the Sudanese side to renew the necessary licenses for an Egyptian commercial center. The project will contribute to providing the Sudanese market’s needs at prices lower than those imported, reducing both cost and time. The minister pointed out the possibility of boosting industrial cooperation in pharmaceutical industries and increasing Egyptian pharmaceutical exports to Sudan. For his part, Madany said that Sudan is eager to enhance economic cooperation prospects with Egypt, especially in the industrial sector, as Sudan targets producing high value-added products by establishing private sector partnerships between the two countries. Also, Gamea discussed with Ibnauf the possibility of participating in the Sudanese capital triangle zone improvement project that includes establishing bridges, renewing sanitation networks and rerouting roads through partnering with Egypt’s private sector.

El-Sisi also opened projects for dairy and livestock products in Fayoum and Nubaria and projects for producing marble and granite in South Sinai’s Ras Sedr city and Ain Sokhna city in Suez Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi inaugurated on Saturday the El-Fayrouz fish farming project in the northeastern Port Said city among other development projects nationwide. The Port Said project is founded over 15,886 feddans and includes two fishing lakes on an area of 9,762 feddans, Mostafa Amin Ali, the general director of the National Service Projects Authority said. The new fish farming project has 5,908 tanks with an annual production capacity estimated at 13,000 tons. The project includes a fish processing factory, an ice production factory, a laboratory for tests and research, a number of water plants and a network of canals and drains. According to Presidential Spokesman Bassam Radi, the project aims at reducing the gap between production and consumption, achieving self-sufficiency, and limiting fish imports. The project is also meant to increase fish exports to Arab and European countries, Radi said, adding that it will contribute to securing foreign currency and supporting the national economy. It is also set to provide 10,000 direct and indirect job opportunities, he noted. In his speech during the inauguration ceremony, El-Sisi said the project was implemented at a high cost, having met comprehensive industrial standards. He said that many national mega-projects were implemented, including in the fields of agriculture, land reclamation and fish farming, noting that the state is developing Lake Manzala near Port Said. “In order for the Lake (Manzala), that is founded on 250,000 feddans, to produce 70,000 or 80,000 tons of fish or more, what we have done should be followed by full control on procedures in the lake,” the president said. El-Sisi also opened a fish farming project at Deeba Triangle in west Port Said via video-conference. According to the head of the National Company for Fish Resources Hamdy Badeen, the Deeba Triangle project is implemented on a total area of 204 feddans. It consists of 72 tanks with an annual production capacity estimated at 250 tons. Ongoing projects The ceremony witnessed the inauguration of other projects via video-conference, including projects for dairy and livestock products in Fayoum and Nubaria and projects for producing marble and granite in South Sinai’s Ras Sedr city and Ain Sokhna city in Suez. El-Sisi said overpopulation was hampering development efforts. “I want to improve the living conditions of all citizens… but population growth is not giving us the chance,” the president added. He referred to a project to develop 1,500 villages, stating that it will provide sanitation services and road networks, drinking water systems, governmental institutions, and other services. He noted that the project will contribute to securing job opportunities for local contractors. The project will significantly develop the countryside within three years, the president added. Railways Egypt is upgrading 10,000 kilometres of railway lines across the country, El-Sisi said, adding that by the end of the year, all old locomotives and railcars will have been replaced. The president revealed plans to establish a new railway line between the northern 6 October city in Giza to Upper Egypt’s Aswan in the south, saying that passengers will be able to travel between the two cities in four hours. He noted that the state rejected foreign bids to implement a 450-kilometre railway line between Ain Sokhna and Alamein valued at $19.5 billion and $10 billion, saying that a 2,000-kilometre railway line is being implemented with a total cost of EGP 350 billion (about $22 billion). “The railway lines we are implementing are a big goal… We are working for our people in Egypt,” El-Sisi said. The president reiterated that overpopulation remains an obstacle to the state’s development efforts, because population grows faster than the state’s resources. Development efforts Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly reviewed a number of state projects being implemented as part of Egypt’s 2030 strategy. The premier said the state has been implementing 31,000 projects to improve people's lives in rural and urban areas. The projects have been implemented with investments valued at over EGP 5.8 trillion, Madbouly said, noting that many of these projects were already implemented and the rest will be finished within three years. Madbouly said the state has been constructing 30 new cities with a total investment of EGP 700 billion. The cities are expected to accommodate around 30 million people, he noted, adding that construction is planned to finish in four years. Madbouly said Egypt has a large number of dry ports, adding that the total investment in these ports amounts to EGP 50 billion. “The goal of developing ports is for Egypt to become a hub for international trade,” Madbouly said. In electricity, the premier said Egypt has invested over EGP 500 billion, adding that the country now has a surplus in power and is capable of exporting it to neighbouring countries. The state has been working to implement 25 governmental, private and non-profit private universities, valued at EGP 150 billion, Madbouly said. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
New efforts are being made to boost economic and trade relations between Egypt and Sudan Egyptian Minister of Trade and Industry Nevine Gamea met with her Sudanese counterparts to mull over increasing bilateral trade cooperation when she attended the Khartoum International Fair from 21 to 28 January in the Sudanese capital. Egypt was the guest of honour at the fair, and Gamea’s meetings were part of Egypt’s determination to open a new page in its trade relations with Sudan. Topping the agenda at the meetings was renewing the licence for the Egyptian Trade Centre in Sudan, this helping to make Egyptian goods available to Sudanese consumers at a lower cost and in a shorter time. Gamea met with Madani Abbas Madani, Sudan’s minister of industry and trade, and Hashim Mohamed bin Auf, minister of infrastructure and transport, to discuss opportunities for economic cooperation and developments in the commercial, industrial, and transport sectors. One of the main challenges facing Egyptian exporters and hindering the flow of trade was the sometimes poor quality of the road network in Sudan, a member of the Egyptian-Sudanese Business Council told Al-Ahram Weekly. He said that the Egyptian government’s intention to establish an integrated transportation company to establish regular transport lines with Sudan would boost bilateral trade, since Egyptian exporters have great potential in Sudanese markets if they can overcome transport problems. According to Gamea, trade between Egypt and Sudan last year reached $862 million, $496 million of which were Egyptian exports to Sudan and $366 million were imports. The most important items traded between the two countries are chemicals, manufactured products, machinery and equipment, food products, textiles, transportation materials, livestock, and agricultural products. Trade with Sudan is already on the rise. In 2019, trade exchanges between Egypt and Sudan recorded around $675 million, up from around $611 million in 2018, an increase of 10.4 per cent. Egyptian exports to Sudan made up 1.5 per cent of total Egyptian exports in 2019, while imports from Sudan were 5.1 per cent of total Sudanese exports. Plastic products were prominent on Egypt’s export list to Sudan in 2019. Exports worth around $81 million were recorded in 2019, up from around $77 million in 2018. Egypt’s exports to Sudan represent about four per cent of its total plastic exports. Iron and steel come second on the list of Egypt’s exports to Sudan, with fertilisers occupying third place followed by glass, utensils, and pharmaceutical products. Constituting almost 98 per cent of Sudan’s exports to Egypt in 2019 were seeds and fruit, livestock, cotton, and meat. In August 2020, Egyptian Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouli travelled to Sudan to discuss with Sudanese counterpart Abdalla Hamdok the transport challenges facing Egyptian exporters to Sudan. They agreed on the need to restructure the Nile Valley Authority for Riverine Navigation (NVARN) to increase its efficiency and upgrade its fleet. NVARN is an Egyptian-Sudanese organisation that transports passengers as well as goods. It was established in 1975 as the only international transporter working on Lake Nasser. Egypt and Sudan have also discussed a project to link the railways of the two countries to increase economic and trade cooperation, develop maritime navigation, and update the cooperation agreement on land transport between Cairo and Khartoum. Madbouli’s visit to Sudan resulted in an agreement to remove obstacles hindering the flow of trade, especially concerning roads leading to land ports. Putting this deal into effect will be a crucial step in achieving economic integration between Egypt and Sudan. Some 21 Egyptian companies participated in this month’s Khartoum International Fair, regarding it as an opportunity to increase their exports to Sudan. The companies specialised in the commercial and service sectors as well as in engineering, food, construction, chemicals, crops, and leather. Ahmed Gaber, a member of the Egyptian-Sudanese Business Council, said that despite the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA) agreements to which Egypt and Sudan are signatories, there are still 54 Egyptian products on which customs are imposed when entering Sudan, constituting a hindrance to Egyptian exports. Regulations related to the Covid-19 currently prevent vehicle traffic across the Egyptian-Sudanese border. Exporters offload their cargoes on the border, from where they are transported by the other country’s vehicles. A problem facing Sudanese importers is a shortage of foreign currency, which affects their ability to import Egyptian products, Gaber said. Were the Egyptian and Sudanese central banks to reach an agreement on credit arrangements, Egyptian exports could win the lion’s share of Sudan’s imports, estimated at $7 billion annually. The establishment of an Egyptian industrial zone in Sudan was another topic of discussion at the meetings between Gamea and her Sudanese counterparts. A feasibility study of the zone has been completed and is awaiting input from the Sudanese side, she said. The industrial zone is expected to attract Egyptian investments into Sudan, Gamea said. According to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), Sudan’s investments in Egypt were $1.9 million in 2018-19, up from $300,000 in 2017-18, an increase of 53.3 per cent. These investments are in the fields of industry, finance, services, agriculture, construction, tourism, and communications. Egypt established 229 projects in Sudan between 2000 and 2013, representing a total investment of $10.8 billion. The projects focused on the industrial, agricultural, and service sectors. The moves to boost prospects for bilateral cooperation with Sudan are part of Egypt’s desire to bolster cooperation with the African countries in the infrastructure, electricity, agricultural, industrial, and irrigation sectors. Sudan is Egypt’s southern gateway to Africa, making it even more necessary for the two countries to cooperate fully in boosting their respective roles on the African continent. *A version of this article appears in print in the 28 January, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly.

New efforts are being made to boost economic and trade relations between Egypt and Sudan Egyptian Minister of Trade and Industry Nevine Gamea met with her Sudanese counterparts to mull over increasing bilateral trade cooperation when she attended the Khartoum International Fair from 21 to 28 January in the Sudanese capital. Egypt was the guest of honour at the fair, and Gamea’s meetings were part of Egypt’s determination to open a new page in its trade relations with Sudan. Topping the agenda at the meetings was renewing the licence for the Egyptian Trade Centre in Sudan, this helping to make Egyptian goods available to Sudanese consumers at a lower cost and in a shorter time. Gamea met with Madani Abbas Madani, Sudan’s minister of industry and trade, and Hashim Mohamed bin Auf, minister of infrastructure and transport, to discuss opportunities for economic cooperation and developments in the commercial, industrial, and transport sectors. One of the main challenges facing Egyptian exporters and hindering the flow of trade was the sometimes poor quality of the road network in Sudan, a member of the Egyptian-Sudanese Business Council told Al-Ahram Weekly. He said that the Egyptian government’s intention to establish an integrated transportation company to establish regular transport lines with Sudan would boost bilateral trade, since Egyptian exporters have great potential in Sudanese markets if they can overcome transport problems. According to Gamea, trade between Egypt and Sudan last year reached $862 million, $496 million of which were Egyptian exports to Sudan and $366 million were imports. The most important items traded between the two countries are chemicals, manufactured products, machinery and equipment, food products, textiles, transportation materials, livestock, and agricultural products. Trade with Sudan is already on the rise. In 2019, trade exchanges between Egypt and Sudan recorded around $675 million, up from around $611 million in 2018, an increase of 10.4 per cent. Egyptian exports to Sudan made up 1.5 per cent of total Egyptian exports in 2019, while imports from Sudan were 5.1 per cent of total Sudanese exports. Plastic products were prominent on Egypt’s export list to Sudan in 2019. Exports worth around $81 million were recorded in 2019, up from around $77 million in 2018. Egypt’s exports to Sudan represent about four per cent of its total plastic exports. Iron and steel come second on the list of Egypt’s exports to Sudan, with fertilisers occupying third place followed by glass, utensils, and pharmaceutical products. Constituting almost 98 per cent of Sudan’s exports to Egypt in 2019 were seeds and fruit, livestock, cotton, and meat. In August 2020, Egyptian Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouli travelled to Sudan to discuss with Sudanese counterpart Abdalla Hamdok the transport challenges facing Egyptian exporters to Sudan. They agreed on the need to restructure the Nile Valley Authority for Riverine Navigation (NVARN) to increase its efficiency and upgrade its fleet. NVARN is an Egyptian-Sudanese organisation that transports passengers as well as goods. It was established in 1975 as the only international transporter working on Lake Nasser. Egypt and Sudan have also discussed a project to link the railways of the two countries to increase economic and trade cooperation, develop maritime navigation, and update the cooperation agreement on land transport between Cairo and Khartoum. Madbouli’s visit to Sudan resulted in an agreement to remove obstacles hindering the flow of trade, especially concerning roads leading to land ports. Putting this deal into effect will be a crucial step in achieving economic integration between Egypt and Sudan. Some 21 Egyptian companies participated in this month’s Khartoum International Fair, regarding it as an opportunity to increase their exports to Sudan. The companies specialised in the commercial and service sectors as well as in engineering, food, construction, chemicals, crops, and leather. Ahmed Gaber, a member of the Egyptian-Sudanese Business Council, said that despite the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA) agreements to which Egypt and Sudan are signatories, there are still 54 Egyptian products on which customs are imposed when entering Sudan, constituting a hindrance to Egyptian exports. Regulations related to the Covid-19 currently prevent vehicle traffic across the Egyptian-Sudanese border. Exporters offload their cargoes on the border, from where they are transported by the other country’s vehicles. A problem facing Sudanese importers is a shortage of foreign currency, which affects their ability to import Egyptian products, Gaber said. Were the Egyptian and Sudanese central banks to reach an agreement on credit arrangements, Egyptian exports could win the lion’s share of Sudan’s imports, estimated at $7 billion annually. The establishment of an Egyptian industrial zone in Sudan was another topic of discussion at the meetings between Gamea and her Sudanese counterparts. A feasibility study of the zone has been completed and is awaiting input from the Sudanese side, she said. The industrial zone is expected to attract Egyptian investments into Sudan, Gamea said. According to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), Sudan’s investments in Egypt were $1.9 million in 2018-19, up from $300,000 in 2017-18, an increase of 53.3 per cent. These investments are in the fields of industry, finance, services, agriculture, construction, tourism, and communications. Egypt established 229 projects in Sudan between 2000 and 2013, representing a total investment of $10.8 billion. The projects focused on the industrial, agricultural, and service sectors. The moves to boost prospects for bilateral cooperation with Sudan are part of Egypt’s desire to bolster cooperation with the African countries in the infrastructure, electricity, agricultural, industrial, and irrigation sectors. Sudan is Egypt’s southern gateway to Africa, making it even more necessary for the two countries to cooperate fully in boosting their respective roles on the African continent. *A version of this article appears in print in the 28 January, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly.

Egypt’s government has launched the second phase of initiative supporting export companies, announcing that the registration will open as of 7 February through until the end of the month. Minister of Finance, Mohamed Maait said on Sunday that the initiative came in implementation of President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi's directives to back the sector, adding that it aims at disbursing the export companies' arrears from the Export Development Fund (EDF) before the end of the current FY2020/2021 (ending in June). The initiative’s second phase will be executed with the same conditions of the first phase, according to Maait. He added that this initiative contributes in providing cash liquidity that enables export companies to meet their financial obligations, keep their labour force and boost the competitiveness of Egyptian products in international markets, especially with the severe impacts that hit the sector due to the COVID-19 crisis. In September, Egypt’s government launched the first phase of the initiative that targeted instant and cash repayment of the entirety of export companies’ arrears from the EDF before the end of 2020 at a repay acceleration discount of 15 percent. 1069 export companies benefitted from the first phase, with total disbursements of EGP 13.5 billion, according to the minister. The initiative is implemented in collaboration with the banking system, as the finance ministry deposits a guarantee at the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) to allow for the payment of the arrears for the companies that are willing to pay their entire dues, according to minister. This will be allowed for the companies that will subscribe to the initiative before the end of February, end of April and the end of June, said Maait. He added that the finance ministry will repay these sums and their proceeds to the banks that contributed to the initiative over three years. The minister revealed that the government disbursed EGP 21 billion over a year in order to support the exports sector through six initiatives. 2500 export companies benefitted from the other five initiatives with a total of EGP 5.6 billion disbursed for the exports during FY2019/2020 as well as EGP 2.4 billion disbursed from July to November 2020. The cabinet has approved five initiatives since October 2019 that aimed to settle the exporters’ arrears through June 2019. The initiatives included the repayment of small investors with a maximum of EGP 5 million, the repayment of 30 percent of the whole arrears to the exporters, holding a set-off between the exporters’ arrears and the payable tax and custom obligations on them, the repayment of the total arrear sums over four to five years while expanding their investments in return, in addition to the land allocation initiative.

Egypt is seeking to strengthen cooperation ties with Iraq via supporting development efforts in the country as part of an oil-for-reconstruction agreement reached between Cairo and Baghdad, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly told Iraq’s Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein during their meeting in the Egyptian capital on Monday. “There are clear and continuous mandates by President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi to the government to strengthen cooperation ties with brotherly Iraq, and to do whatever it takes to support development efforts on Iraq’s land, especially after an agreement was reached on activating the oil-for-reconstruction mechanism,” Madbouly stressed to the Hussein, according to a cabinet statement. The Egyptian PM and Iraqi foreign minister met yesterday on the sideline of the emergency meeting of Arab foreign ministers at the Arab League (AL) in Cairo, which discussed the Palestinian cause and other regional issues. Madbouly said he is following up on the implementation of the cooperation deals agreed upon between the two countries during the latest meetings of the Egyptian-Iraqi High committee, as well as the tripartite meetings between Egypt, Iraq, and Jordan. During a meeting of the Egyptian-Iraqi High Committee in Baghdad in October, Cairo and Baghdad reached an initial agreement to establish an oil-for-reconstruction mechanism, under which Egyptian companies are to implement construction projects in Iraq in return for Iraq providing Egypt with certain quantities of oil. With the aim of boosting bilateral cooperation, both countries also signed 15 agreements and memoranda of understanding in various fields, including oil, transport, roads, housing, construction, trade, industry, and others. Meanwhile, Egypt, Iraq, and Jordan are targeting cementing cooperation ties in different fields, foremost of which are the oil pipeline power linkages ventures, as agreed during the latest tripartite summits between the three countries, the latest of which was held in Cairo in December. Hussein expressed to Madbouly his country’s hope “to build on the outcomes of the High Committee meetings hosted in Baghdad, and to maximise the benefit from the oil-for-reconstruction mechanism.” The Iraqi foreign minister said he is following up with his counterparts in Egypt and Jordan on other trilateral cooperation files. Earlier on Monday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry met with Hussein and their Jordanian counterpart in a tripartite meeting also on the sidelines of the emergency meeting to coordinate positions on issues of mutual concern and the Palestinian cause.

News article:
The agenda can mobilise up to €30 billion in private and public investments in the region over the next decade The European Commission and the high representative announced the adoption of a new agenda for the Mediterranean region, including Egypt, the European delegation in Egypt said on Wednesday. The European Union (EU) in Brussels said the agenda is meant to boost the strategic partnership between the EU and the Mediterranean, according to the EU statement. “The new agenda is based on the conviction that by working together and in a spirit of partnership, common challenges can be turned into opportunities, in the mutual interest of the EU and its Southern Neighbours,” said the EU. The agenda includes an economic and investment plan that targets boosting the long-term socio-economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in the southern neighbourhood, read the statement. Under the new EU's Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), up to €7 billion for the period 2021 to 2027 will be allocated to its implementation, which can mobilise around €30 billion in private and public investments in the region over the next decade. “This communication sends a crucial message about the importance we attach to our Southern Neighbourhood. A strengthened Mediterranean partnership remains a strategic imperative for the European Union. 25 years after the Barcelona Declaration and 10 years after the Arab Spring, challenges in the Mediterranean – many of which resulting from global trends – remain daunting,”, said EU High Representative and Vice-President Josep Borrell. “To address these challenges, we need to renew our mutual efforts and act closely together as partners, in the interest of all of us. This is what this new agenda is all about. We are determined to work together with our Southern Partners on a new agenda that will focus on people, especially women and youth, and help them meet their hopes for the future, enjoy their rights and build a peaceful, secure, more democratic, greener, prosperous and inclusive Southern Neighbourhood,” Borrell explained. The Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Olivér Várhelyi said that the renewed partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood presents a new beginning in EU’s relations with its southern partners. “Based on common interests and common challenges, developed together with our neighbours... Europe wants to contribute directly to a long-term vision of prosperity and stability of the region, especially in the social and economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. In close dialogue with our partners, we have identified a number of priority sectors, from creating growth and jobs, investing in human capital, and good governance. We consider migration to be a common challenge, where we are ready to work to fight irregular migration and smugglers together with our partners as it is a risk for all of us. We will work together to bring real change on the ground for the benefit of both our neighbours and Europe,” according to Várhelyi. The EU said that the new agenda focuses on five policy areas, including human development, good governance and the rule of law, resilience, prosperity, and digital transition. It also includes providing support to countries to address security challenges and find solutions to ongoing conflicts, in addition to addressing the challenges of forced displacement and irregular migration, and facilitating safe and legal pathways for migration and mobility. The agenda concentrates on green transition as well as introducing an economic investment plan for the Southern Neighbours to ensure the quality of life for people in the region improves and economic recovery is realised. The plan includes preliminary flagship initiatives to strengthen resilience, build prosperity and increase trade and investment to support competitiveness and inclusive growth. The EU provided support to Egypt mainly through the European Neighbourhood Instrument with €756 million in the period from 2014 to 2020. Since 2008, Egypt has been a beneficiary of the Neighbourhood Investment Platform which leveraged €7 billion in concessional loans from European Financial Institutions combined with public and private sector financing for projects in the sector of renewable energy, energy efficiency, irrigation, water and wastewater management, transport, financial inclusion, support to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and education, according to the EU. Moreover, projects under the North of Africa window of the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF Africa) in Egypt amount to €89 million, stated the EU. In addition, Egypt benefits from EU thematic programmes and instruments, including the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, the Civil Society Organisations and Local Authorities programme under the Development Cooperation Instrument, the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA) and Horizon 2020.

The two officials discussed bilateral cooperation in the fields of energy and combating terrorism and extremist ideology Cairo is looking forward to increasing the ongoing coordination with Jordan at the bilateral level, and within the framework of the two countries’ trilateral cooperation mechanism with Iraq, President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi told Jordanian Prime Minister Bisher Al-Khasawneh on Thursday. El-Sisi received PM Al-Khasawneh, who is on an official visit to the Egyptian capital. Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly and head of Egypt's General Intelligence Service Abbas Kamel attended the meeting, according to a statement by presidential spokesperson Bassam Rady. During the meeting, El-Sisi described Egypt-Jordan relations as historical and close, the statement added. The Jordanian prime minister expressed his country's keenness to continue to coordinate with Egypt on different fronts as well as promote bilateral cooperation in a way that contributes to confronting the joint challenges facing the Arab world. He added that Egypt is playing a "pivotal" role in the region, the statement added. The meeting dealt with bilateral cooperation in the fields of energy, combating terrorism and extremist ideology, bolstering economic ties and enhancing trade. The mechanisms of implementing the ventures agreed upon within the framework of the trilateral cooperation between Egypt, Jordan and Iraq were also tackled during the meeting, which followed a meeting between El-Sisi and Iraq's Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein in Cairo a day prior. Egypt, Jordan and Iraq have been pushing for fostering trilateral cooperation in terms of the economy, trade, energy and investment to establish strategic integration between Egypt, Jordan and Iraq. The three leaders held three trilateral summits to push forward their efforts, the latest of which was held in the Jordanian capital Amman in August 2020. A fourth summit is set to be held soon to follow up on the previous steps. The meeting also touched upon the latest developments in the regional situations as both countries' officials agreed to maintain coordination to affirm the principle of a comprehensive political settlement for various disputes and issues in the region. They also discussed the developments of the peace process in the Middle East in light of the results of the last ministerial meeting of the Arab League on Monday. The statement added that the officials agreed to work on intensifying international efforts to settle the Palestinian crisis based on international legitimacy resolutions to resume peace negotiations. Cairo has been in talks with several Western parties to push forward the frozen Israeli-Palestinian peace process. In February 2020, Egypt, along with Jordan, France, and Germany, formed the quartet committee to revive the halted negotiations. The committee has so far held four meetings, the latest of which was hosted by Cairo earlier this month, where the foreign ministers of the four countries forged 11 provisions detailed in a joint statement outlining the endeavours to revive the peace process.

The three-day visit will include detailed consultations with Egyptian counterpart officials and with leading Egyptian businessmen and members of the Pakistani community. The visit is expected to further strengthen and diversify Pakistan’s bilateral ties with Egypt, noted the statement. The statement added that Egypt plays a key role in the Middle East, while its deep linkages with the African continent make it a gateway to Africa. Pakistan values its partnership with Egypt, which is in line with its desire to forge stronger ties with the Islamic world, as well as its initiative dubbed ‘Engage Africa’, the Pakistani foreign ministry’s statement pointed out. The two countries have similar perceptions on a range of regional and global issues, with more than 40 agreements signed between both sides in diverse fields, providing a firm basis for enhanced cooperation. Bilateral cooperation is advanced through strong institutional mechanisms, including the Joint Ministerial Commission, Annual Bilateral Consultations, and Joint Business Council, the statement added.

Qureshi conveyed to Sisi a message from the Pakistani president that includes an official invitation to visit Islamabad Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi said on Wednesday that Cairo welcomes the development of bilateral cooperation with Pakistan, and is keen to enhance coordination on various regional issues so as to develop bilateral cooperation and exchange expertise in various fields. This came, according to a presidential statement, during El-Sisi's meeting with Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in the presence of his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry. El-Sisi also said that Egypt "is keen on strengthening coordination and consultation with Pakistan" on various regional issues and issues of common interest, at the top of which is combating terrorism and extremist ideology, which is one of the most important challenges facing the two countries. Similar to Pakistan's war against terrorism in the Kashmir region, Egypt has been fighting an Islamist insurgency led by the Islamic State’s branch in North Sinai, formerly known as Ansar Beit El-Maqdis, since 2013. Earlier in the same day, during his press conference with Shoukry, Qureshi stressed that Egypt and Pakistan are able to establish a network to eradicate terrorism and intolerance. El-Sisi and Qureshi reviewed the latest developments in the Middle East and the Islamic world. They both emphasised the importance of continuing intensive coordination and pushing forward joint efforts to maintain regional and international peace and security and combat terrorism, the statement said. They also agreed to intensify efforts to correct religious discourse and spread the true religion of Islam. "Egypt considers Pakistan with great regard and appreciation as one of the largest Islamic countries," El-Sisi said. Official invitation to visit Pakistan Qureshi conveyed to El-Sisi a message from the Pakistani president that included an official invitation to visit Pakistan, the Egyptian presidency said. The Pakistani minister said that this comes within the framework of the depth of relations between the two friendly countries and peoples, with the aspiration to explore new horizons for bilateral cooperation between Egypt and Pakistan. Qureshi also emphasised that "Egypt's stability is a pillar of stability in the Middle East and the Islamic world as a whole." The Pakistani minister also conveyed the greetings of Pakistan's prime minister, who lauded the inspiring Egyptian experience, represented by the huge achievements Egypt has witnessed during the past years in various fields with the wise leadership and insightful vision of El-Sisi. Such achievements start with combating terrorism and achieving security and stability, and the efforts to achieve comprehensive development through deep economic reform as well as establishing mega national projects, Qureshi said. Pakistan looks upon the development experience of Egypt with admiration in light of the similarities of the situations in both countries and the common challenges facing them, Qureshi said. El-Sisi asked Qureshi to convey his greetings to Pakistan's President Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Imran Khan, while hailing the historical relations between the two countries. Egypt and Pakistan have had official diplomatic relations since 1948. Egypt was one of the first countries in the Middle East to open an embassy in Pakistan after its independence. Boosting economic relations Presidential spokesperson Bassam Rady said that El-Sisi's meeting with Qureshi also tackled strengthening the frameworks for bilateral cooperation between the two countries in a number of fields in a manner that is consistent with the status and potential of the two countries and that meets the aspirations of their peoples. According to a Monday statement by the Pakistani foreign ministry, Qureshi's visit would include detailed consultations with Egyptian officials and with leading Egyptian businessmen and members of the Pakistani community. The visit is also expected to further strengthen and diversify Pakistan’s bilateral ties with Egypt, the statement said. While in his meeting with Shoukry earlier on Wednesday, Qureshi said that various agreements would be signed between the two countries during his visit. Rady said that among the discussed fields of cooperation are security and economic cooperation, in addition to trade and investment exchange, including exploring horizons for economic cooperation between Pakistan's Gwadar Port and Egypt's Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCEZ) to establish integrated industrial projects within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative. Given the amount of traffic expected to hit the Pakistani port and Egypt's SCEZ in the coming years due to being two of the major spots on China’s Belt and Road Initiative, observers believe that the Pakistani minister's visit to Cairo will boost economic relations and enhance the partnership between both countries. In 2018, the Egyptian-Pakistani Forum explored the economic opportunities from the exact approach. The forum at the time was organised by Islamabad's South Asian Strategic Stability Institute in Egypt to mark the 70th anniversary of the beginning of relations between the two countries.

News article:
Egypt plays a key role in the Middle East, while its deep links with the African continent make it a gateway to Africa,” read the statement issued by the Pakistani Foreign Ministry ahead of Pakistani Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi’s three-day visit to Egypt. Qureshi arrived in Cairo on Tuesday night, Doaa El-Bey reports. Pakistan and Egypt enjoy close relations, share a common faith, culture and values, and face similar challenges when it comes to coronavirus and terrorism, noted Ali Al-Hefni, former deputy to Egypt’s Foreign Minister. “It is therefore important to hold periodic bilateral meetings to discuss issues of common interest,” he said, adding that “the two countries have similar views on a range of regional and international issues.” Egypt is in a position to open doors for Pakistan in Africa. “During its chairmanship of the African Union in 2019, Egypt noticeably improved its relations with African states and can help Pakistan enhance its presence in Africa. And in the light of the ongoing rivalry between India and Pakistan, it is only to be expected that Pakistan will seek to open up its relations across the African continent, not least in response to the India-Africa Forum, an official platform for African-Indian relations that holds regular summits,” Al-Hefni added. During the three-day visit, Islamabad also hoped to benefit from Egypt’s expertise in social housing. Pakistan is currently considering expanding its densely populated cities. The crises in Libya and Syria were also high on the agenda. Qureshi’s visit included consultations with Egyptian officials and businessmen, as well as members of the Pakistani community in Egypt. They discussed ways to strengthen bilateral trade and develop scientific and cultural cooperation. The visit also tackled the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic and ways of combating terrorism. Qureshi’s visit followed an invitation from his Egyptian counterpart, Sameh Shoukri, and came on the back of meetings between Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi and Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan. The two leaders met on the sidelines of the summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Mecca in 2019 and at the 74th session of the UN General Assembly in New York the same year. During the meetings the two leaders agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation and enhance high-level exchanges. Last year, Khan discussed his Global Initiative on Debt Relief in a telephone conversation with Al-Sisi. The initiative aims to provide debt relief for developing countries and free up funds to fight the coronavirus pandemic. In the most recent call between Shoukri and Qureshi in December the two ministers expressed a desire for continuous coordination. Cairo and Islamabad have jointly signed more than 40 agreements and work together closely in the multilateral arena, in particular the United Nations, OIC and the Non-Aligned Movement. *A version of this article appears in print in the 18 February, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

Egypt plays a key role in the Middle East, while its deep links with the African continent make it a gateway to Africa,” read the statement issued by the Pakistani Foreign Ministry ahead of Pakistani Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi’s three-day visit to Egypt. Qureshi arrived in Cairo on Tuesday night, Doaa El-Bey reports. Pakistan and Egypt enjoy close relations, share a common faith, culture and values, and face similar challenges when it comes to coronavirus and terrorism, noted Ali Al-Hefni, former deputy to Egypt’s Foreign Minister. “It is therefore important to hold periodic bilateral meetings to discuss issues of common interest,” he said, adding that “the two countries have similar views on a range of regional and international issues.” Egypt is in a position to open doors for Pakistan in Africa. “During its chairmanship of the African Union in 2019, Egypt noticeably improved its relations with African states and can help Pakistan enhance its presence in Africa. And in the light of the ongoing rivalry between India and Pakistan, it is only to be expected that Pakistan will seek to open up its relations across the African continent, not least in response to the India-Africa Forum, an official platform for African-Indian relations that holds regular summits,” Al-Hefni added. During the three-day visit, Islamabad also hoped to benefit from Egypt’s expertise in social housing. Pakistan is currently considering expanding its densely populated cities. The crises in Libya and Syria were also high on the agenda. Qureshi’s visit included consultations with Egyptian officials and businessmen, as well as members of the Pakistani community in Egypt. They discussed ways to strengthen bilateral trade and develop scientific and cultural cooperation.

The President's statement came during a virtual preparatory meeting ahead of the fifth high-level African Constitutional Conference set to be hosted in Cairo this year Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi told the heads of African constitutional and supreme courts and constitutional councils that constitutions should always be reviewed and updated to keep up with challenges affecting the fast-changing world. In a speech Saturday during the virtual preparatory meeting Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC) hosted ahead of the fifth high-level African Constitutional Conference, El-Sisi asked participating parties to discuss the challenges that face the continent and to work collectively to set joint constitutional rules to support visions. He said the meeting is meant to bring African judicial bodies under one umbrella. El-Sisi added that the status quo forces African countries to deal with the repercussions of the pandemic, adding that the digital transformation requires regulating the legal framework to manage cybersecurity and social media platforms. “The status quo requires us to think collectively in dealing with emerging challenges from the pandemic from a legal and constitutional perspective, and other traditional challenges, led by cooperation for combating terrorism as an obstacle for development and stability,” he said. Combating terrorism, therefore, requires contributions through constitutional law mechanisms to eliminate imminent threats, especially amid efforts to make Africa a unified and harmonious continent, he said. El-Sisi said that the unprecedented and accelerated shift towards digital transformation in societies, the rehabilitation of healthcare systems, and the transition towards a green economy were among emerging challenges arising from the pandemic. He said these changes require “the availability of the [needed] modern constitutional infrastructure capable of dealing with the challenges.” El-Sisi stressed the necessity of regulating the legal framework dealing with cybersecurity, legal governance for social media platforms and its content, and others related to large databases and personal information of citizens. El-Sisi highlighted Egypt’s efforts in the past few years to undertake effective steps towards providing the needed infrastructure to achieve the digital transformation of governmental services. Such steps have emerged as crucial amid the pandemic outbreak, he said. The president invited the participants to benefit from the digital judicial platform launched in previous meetings for the benefit of Africa. The fifth high-level African Constitutional Conference is scheduled to be held later this year in Cairo, according to a SCC statement on Friday. Saturday’s meeting, held under the auspices of President El-Sisi, was chaired by the head of the SCC, Chancellor Said Marei, and attended by senior African judges and international experts, the statement added. The meeting tackled the agenda that will be discussed during the conference, including the "E-justice in Africa since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic," according to Adel Omar Sherif, the vice-chairperson of the SCC.

News article:
Cohen revealed that the US has invested over $80 billion in Egypt over the last 43 years. The US is optimistic about Egypt’s economy and is aware of the many opportunities that can be tapped in the market by American businesspersons and companies, according to the US Ambassador to Egypt, Jonathan Cohen. Ambassador Cohen made his statements to the monthly webinar held on Tuesday virtually by the American Chamber of Commerce in Cairo. Building partnerships, creating platforms of collaboration, and tapping the opportunities the Egyptian market has were the key areas that Cohen touched upon. Cohen asserted the robust partnership between the US and Egypt that has lasted for decades in the areas of military, diplomacy, and economy. He highlighted cooperation between the two countries in several issues, including the COVID-19 crisis, the Libyan issue, and the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, as well as continuing to support the peace process in the region. “The United States has provided longstanding assistance to Egypt’s military, economy, and cultural institutions, helping make the country more resilient through our security partnership, educational and cultural exchanges, and development work,” said Cohen. Moreover, Cohen revealed that the US has invested over $80 billion in Egypt over the last 43 years. He also lauded Egypt’s economic reform programme, which was implemented between 2016 through 2019, saying that it helped Egypt accumulate the buffers that helped the country navigate the ongoing crisis. These reforms have led Egypt to witness a positive growth in 2020, the only country in the region to do so, according to the International Monetary Fund’s estimations. Moreover, Cohen highlighted Egypt’s position as the first destination for foreign direct investments in Africa. Global credit institutions have also praised Egypt’s economy and its resilience in the face of the pandemic, according to Cohen. Cohen pinpointed the opportunities that the Egyptian economy has, especially in education, information and communication technology (ICT), entrepreneurship, transportation, fintech, e-commerce, health tech, power, and oil and gas sectors, urging American companies to tap such opportunities. Regarding ICT, Cohen said that it represents the fastest growing sector in the Egyptian economy, growing by 35 percent in 2020. He asserted the significant opportunities that the sector has, especially with the pandemic’s implications and how they have proven the major role the sector can play in times of crises. In terms of transportation, the ambassador said that Egypt’s minister of transport has announced 31 transport projects, which are open to investment, calling interested American investors to take advantage of such opportunities. “Egypt is investing in its economic future by launching new transportation and infrastructure projects linking Egyptian cities and ports with global markets,” said Cohen. Concerning entrepreneurship, Cohen emphasised the private sector’s importance in driving Egypt’s growth and in creating job opportunities, especially with the fast growing population of the country. In this regard, Cohen pointed to the American-Egyptian Entrepreneurship Fund that dedicates $300 million for supporting entrepreneurs and SMEs in Egypt, adding that 700 entrepreneurs have benefitted from the fund so far. Regarding healthcare, Cohen said that the medical city that Egypt is establishing in the new Administrative Capital also has significant investment opportunities for American business owners, particularly in supplying it with the required medical devices and in exchanging experiences. In terms of the energy sector, Cohen stressed the US’ support to Egypt for its aspiration to be an energy hub, calling American investors to benefit from the investment opportunities the sector provides at the present time. He also noted that agri-business in Egypt has critical opportunities for American investors, especially in know-how technologies, unveiling that US agricultural exports to Egypt grew by 23 percent in 2020, despite the pandemic, while Egypt’s agricultural exports to the US increased by 22 percent in the same year. Cohen invited American companies to expand their current business in Egypt and to tap current investment opportunities, illustrating that the US embassy is ready to provide to them with market insights, data on Egypt’s economic condition, as well as linking them with decision makers.

The private sector should direct its investments to state projects, Madbouly said Egypt counts on the private sector to raise growth levels through its investments in the government's projects and initiatives, said Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly at a webinar organised by the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Egypt on Thursday. Madbouly added that the government has allocated EGP 500 billion for the Decent Life initiative and its affiliated projects despite the coronavirus crisis and the subsequent pressure on the state budget. The projects of the initiative are meant to upgrade the infrastructure of Egyptian villages, improve the quality of life of their people, create job opportunities, reduce the harsh repercussions of the pandemic on the vulnerable, and enable them to access basic needs and services, Madbouly said. The private sector should play a pivotal role in this regard through investing in the initiative’s projects. “We will not continue to spend more and more from the state budget in such projects. The private sector should be at the fore, directing its investments to state projects.” Madbouly urged American investors to tap the opportunities that Egypt have, asserting Egypt’s desire for more involvement in the Egyptian economy by the US private sector. He noted that US investments in Egypt stood at about $23 billion in 2020. The prime minister stated that COVID-19 has caused the harshest impact on the economy in seven decades. He highlighted the precautionary and pre-emptive measures that Egypt adopted during the first wave of the pandemic that contributed to, together with the successful economic reform programme, making Egypt the only country in the region to see positive growth in 2020 and to navigate the crisis with minimum losses. He noted that the government managed to set the balance between preserving public health and managing the economy without resorting to a total lockdown. The measures included allocating EGP 100 billion to mitigate the repercussions of the pandemic, appropriating a total of EGP 13 billion to support the export sector, applying a comprehensive system of detecting and tracking infected cases, launching the Universal Health Insurance system, and securing the basic food and medical supplies the market needs. On the support Egypt’s banking sector extended, Madbouly explained that it has allocated EGP 50 billion to back real-estate for low and middle-income classes and EGP 20 billion to support the stock market. Egypt has also launched launching other initiatives that target boosting the private sector, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and retail loans. “Egypt is focused now on regaining its macroeconomic pre-pandemic levels. For this purpose, we are working on upgrading the country’s road networks, ports, and implementing projects that secure a sustainable and resilient economy, including establishing sustainable cities, such as the New Administrative Capital,” Madbouly said. He underscored Egypt’s strategic target to be a regional energy hub, noting that the private sector has a critical role to play in this regard and has the chance to tap the significant opportunities that the sector provides. Madbouly added that Egypt targets securing 20 percent of its energy needs from renewable resources by 2022. He said the country has started the vaccination process already, adding that Egypt has contracted with the COVAX Coalition to receive vaccine shipments in a bid to secure the country’s needs. Coronavirus infections in Egypt are now under control, however, he added. Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of the International Affairs Division at the US Chamber of Commerce in Washington, said that the US business community is focusing on investing in healthcare, fintech, digitisation, agri-business, and energy in Egypt. Brilliant added that the US business community is committed to strengthening bilateral economic relations and investing in Egypt’s growth, stressing that the US businesspersons in Washington and Egypt are paying great attention to investing in Egypt and to bring new investors to the domestic market as well. He lauded Egypt’s economic and structural reforms that enabled the country to navigate the crisis with resilience and strength. Search Keywords: Short link:

Last November, Sudanese air force units and Egyptian commando teams conducted a joint Egyptian-Sudanese air drill, Nile Eagles1, the first of its kind. During a visit by Farid to Khartoum in November, Egyptian and Sudanese military leaders agreed to accelerate joint security and military cooperation. They also agreed to carry out more drills for all armed forces branches, and step up cooperation in training, border security and combating terrorism, as well as technical insurance and military industries.

During a visit by Farid to Khartoum in November, Egyptian and Sudanese military leaders agreed to accelerate joint security and military cooperation. They also agreed to carry out more drills for all armed forces branches, and step up cooperation in training, border security and combating terrorism, as well as technical insurance and military industries.

Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly gave a speech via video conference in an African Union (AU) meeting on behalf of the president Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi stressed on Wednesday the importance of intensifying international cooperation to eradicate the coronavirus pandemic and its implications in Africa through efforts including fair vaccine distribution among countries. Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly delivered El-Sisi's statement in a speech via video conference in an African Union (AU) meeting. French President Emmanuel Macron, Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi, who is the current chair of the AU, and African leaders participated in the meeting. In the speech, El-Sisi urged continuing coordination between the African Union and international partners to support the health systems in Africa. He also affirmed the importance of cooperation to enable the African continent to produce coronavirus vaccine doses amid challenges related to the production capacities and fair distribution of medicines and vaccines. In this regard, El-Sisi expressed appreciation for his French counterpart’s efforts to continuously coordinate with AU member states in order to support the health and medical systems in Africa against the pandemic and enable African countries to have fair access to vaccine doses in the appropriate time and with acceptable prices. The president also hailed Macron’s representation of the African voice at the latest Group of Seven Summit, saying that this representation contributed positively to the G7 Leaders statement released after the summit. According to the 19 February statement, the G7 Leaders committed over $4 billion to the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator ACT-A and the Gavi-led global initiative aimed at equitable access to coronavirus vaccines, known as COVAX. This raised the collective G7 support to $7.5 billion. In an interview with the Financial Times in February, Macron proposed that rich Western countries give 3 to 5 percent of their current coronavirus vaccine stock to Africa. “I would like to emphasise that our African peoples deserve a lot from us in order to advance our health system,” El-Sisi’s statement said. He added that advancing the African health system requires “continuing our relentless efforts to develop our continental work and international solidarity in order to overcome the negative challenges the coronavirus pandemic has posed.” “Let us always bear in mind the aspirations and hopes of our African peoples, who rely on us in securing the vaccine. This invites us to speak with one voice in all regional and international forums, to ensure the advancement of the African health system,” the president added. Search Keywords: Short link:

The second edition of the Aswan Forum shed light on challenges facing the African continent. Covid-19 topped the list Policymakers and experts are expected to develop context-specific and action-oriented recommendations as to how Africa can recover from the coronavirus pandemic after the Aswan II Forum ends on 5 March. Through the so-called “Aswan Conclusions”, African, national, regional and continental stakeholders, together with global partners, are expected to join forces to ensure that the ramifications of the pandemic do not impede the achievement of the African Union’s 2063 Agenda “The Africa We Want”. The Aswan Forum II was held this week under the theme “Shaping Africa’s New Normal: Recovering Stronger, Rebuilding Better”. The forum’s second edition was held virtually starting 1 March. The first was held in December 2019 in Aswan. In the keynote speech that he delivered in the opening session, Egypt’s Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri highlighted the importance of joint African action and “diligent work” to achieve peace and development in the continent. More importantly, he stressed the importance of finding ways to deal with the impact of Covid-19 on various fields and trying to find the required solutions to the unprecedented challenge in a way that realises the targets of the AU’s 2063 Agenda and the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. “The pandemic contributed to exacerbating the traditional challenges that Africa faces in the fields of peace and security. Thus, it is important to bolster African countries’ capabilities to face the present security challenges, topped by combating terrorism and foreign terrorists,” Shoukri said in his address to the inaugural session. In his speech, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi highlighted that Egypt was keen to hold the second edition of the forum to use the momentum generated by the first edition and its successes. “Driven by its faith, Egypt believes that the present time is optimum to discuss together the daunting challenges facing our continent to seek the best ways and mechanisms to shore up our common efforts to get over the pandemic and to rebuild better to take our continent to safety,” he said. Al-Sisi described the activation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) earlier this year as a “good example of the success of our collective work”. He said that besides the challenge of Covid-19, the continent was still suffering from the danger of armed conflicts and civil wars, as well as organized crime, the spread of weapons, illegal emigration and forced displacement. “All these challenges require joint efforts to support the mechanism that stops and settles conflicts and enhances the continent’s abilities to face these challenges.” Thus, he said, African and international solidarity is an urgent matter for humanity to overcome these challenges as well as that of the coronavirus. “The current stage has brought new challenges, foremost of which is providing the necessary vaccine for our peoples. I would like to emphasise the necessity of providing such a vaccine in a more equitable and just manner in response to the demands of the peoples of our continent,” he said. Al-Sisi’s speech was followed by addresses from several other African presidents, including those of Rwanda, Burundi, Tunisia, and South Sudan who agreed that the continent is passing through exceptional circumstances and that solidarity and joint work is the only way to deal with the challenge. UN Secretary-General António Guterres and Chairperson of the African Union Commission Musa Faki participated in the forum. Guterres called for a global vaccination plan that makes the coronavirus vaccines available and equally distributed. He also urged the international community to support the world’s most vulnerable people and countries by taking various measures, from strengthening health systems to providing debt relief. “Pandemic recovery is also an opportunity to address the fragilities and inequalities that have been exposed by the pandemic, and to pursue a more inclusive and sustainable path that advances gender equality and safeguards the global environment,” he said in his address to the opening session. Guterres concluded by praising the Africans’ efforts to advance the well-being of the continent’s people. “The United Nations will continue to support Africa’s efforts across this agenda, including silencing the guns,” Guterres said. Faki said that the pandemic revealed the dire need for African countries to build more resilient economies to face crises. He highlighted the need to work on establishing a new healthcare system and building health capacities to ensure proper healthcare to all Africans. The first day’s sessions of the forum were devoted to discussing the impact of the pandemic, ways to recover from it, how to strengthen sustainable peace and development, and the need for an integrated response to the growth of terrorism in the shadow of the pandemic. The AU theme for the forum is “Arts, Culture and Heritage: Levers for Building the Africa We Want”. The issue was discussed in detail on the third day. Soft power was said to be likely to bring nations together in a way that helps them address challenges with enlightened thought that fits the culture and civilisation of the African nations. It also tackled other fields, including enhancing intra-African trade after the launch of the AfCFTA in January. The forum, which saw the participation of African leaders, senior officials and heads of governments, will end on Friday with the closing session “Chartering Africa’s Way Forward: Recovering Stronger Rebuilding Better”. The event is organised by the Cairo International Centre for Conflict Resolution, Peacebuilding and Peacekeeping. *A version of this article appears in print in the 4 March, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) is calling on its supporters to urge US senators to seek a broader nuclear agreement with Iran, media reported on Saturday. According to a text message cited by Press TV, AIPAC says that Iran “Israel's and America's greatest threat in the Middle East,” and asks its supporters to convince US lawmakers to sign the Menendez/Graham draft letter that opposes reviving the 2015 agreement in its current form. “Please urge your senators to sign a bipartisan letter to President Biden... expressing the bipartisan consensus that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose a grave threat to US national security interests and our allies and partners,” said the group. While this call is not rejecting the idea of reviving the deal, AIPAC has also launched a campaign against the deal itself.

Forty-three U.S. senators, many of whom opposed the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, appealed to President Joe Biden on Thursday to work toward an international agreement that addresses issues beyond just Tehran's nuclear program. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The letter was released as the Democrat Biden's administration explores ways to restore the nuclear pact that Iran signed with the United States and other world powers, but was abandoned in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump, a Republican who reimposed sanctions. 3 View gallery Iranian President Hassan Rouhani visits one of the country's nuclear sites ( Photo: AFP ) Iran retaliated by breaching the terms of the accord in a step-by-step response. "Democrats and Republicans may have tactical differences, but we are united on preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon and addressing the wide range of Iranian behavior," the senators wrote in a letter to Biden, dated Thursday. The letter was led by Democratic Senator Bob Menendez and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and signed by 41 other Democrats and Republicans. 3 View gallery U.S. President Joe Biden ( Photo: AP ) It notes the "long-held view" from lawmakers and presidents from both parties that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose a grave threat to the natural security interests of the United States and its allies and partners. But it also says Iran poses a threat by exporting arms, supporting militants who target U.S. forces and via its ballistic and cruise missile programs. It also called for the release of political prisoners. The letter echoes an argument made for years by opponents of the nuclear agreement, who contended that any negotiation with Iran should address a wide range of concerns. 3 View gallery Iran's nuclear water reactor in Arak ( Photo: EPA ) Advocates for the nuclear deal said it was more likely to be successful if it focused on reining in Tehran's nuclear ambitions rather than a broader agenda. Menendez, now Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, was among Democrats who broke from then-President Barack Obama's administration to join nearly every congressional Republican in opposing the nuclear agreement, which was also fiercely opposed by Israel.

Forty-three U.S. senators, many of whom opposed the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, appealed to President Joe Biden on Thursday to work toward an international agreement that addresses issues beyond just Tehran's nuclear program.

"Democrats and Republicans may have tactical differences, but we are united on preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon and addressing the wide range of Iranian behavior," the senators wrote in a letter to Biden, dated Thursday. The letter was led by Democratic Senator Bob Menendez and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and signed by 41 other Democrats and Republicans. 3 View gallery U.S. President Joe Biden ( Photo: AP ) It notes the "long-held view" from lawmakers and presidents from both parties that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose a grave threat to the natural security interests of the United States and its allies and partners. But it also says Iran poses a threat by exporting arms, supporting militants who target U.S. forces and via its ballistic and cruise missile programs. It also called for the release of political prisoners. The letter echoes an argument made for years by opponents of the nuclear agreement, who contended that any negotiation with Iran should address a wide range of concerns. 3 View gallery Iran's nuclear water reactor in Arak ( Photo: EPA ) Advocates for the nuclear deal said it was more likely to be successful if it focused on reining in Tehran's nuclear ambitions rather than a broader agenda. Menendez, now Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, was among Democrats who broke from then-President Barack Obama's administration to join nearly every congressional Republican in opposing the nuclear agreement, which was also fiercely opposed by Israel.

News article:
A bipartisan group of more than 40 senators is sounding the alarm on Iran’s nuclear program, urging President Biden to use a mix of “diplomatic and economic tools.” The letter to Biden — led by Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) — comes as Biden seeks to have the U.S. rejoin the Iran nuclear deal that former President Trump withdrew from in 2018, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). “While we may have differing views on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action of 2015 and the overall approach of the Trump Administration’s maximum pressure campaign, we must confront the reality that Iran has accelerated its nuclear activity in alarming ways including increasing its centrifuge research and production and enriching uranium up to 20 percent,” the 41 senators wrote. “Iran should have no doubt about America’s policy. Democrats and Republicans may have tactical differences, but we are united on preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon and addressing the wide range of illicit Iranian behavior,” they continued. The Biden administration has said it does not intend to lift sanctions imposed by the Trump administration that targeted a wide range of Iranian sectors until Tehran returns to compliance with the JCPOA — in particular, limiting the country’s uranium enrichment to 3.67 percent under the terms of the deal. Iran has rejected those terms, calling for the Biden administration and international community to lift sanctions imposed by the Trump administration before it will agree to return to compliance with the deal. Tehran also has threatened to ban visits by international nuclear inspectors that are required by the terms of the deal if concessions are not reached. Most Democratic lawmakers have thrown their support behind Biden’s efforts to rejoin the JCPOA. But Republicans have outright rejected rejoining the agreement even as the Biden administration says it would use it as a starting point to negotiate a “longer and stronger” deal that addresses Iran’s other behavior. This includes confronting Iran over its ballistic missile program; funding for terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East; human rights abuses against its own citizens; and politically motivated arrests of American citizens. The bipartisan letter sent Thursday acknowledged such differences between Democrats and Republicans. “Looking ahead, we strongly believe that you should use the full force of our diplomatic and economic tools in concert with our allies on the United Nations Security Council and in the region to reach an agreement that prevents Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons and meaningfully constrains its destabilizing activity throughout the Middle East and its ballistic missile program,” the senators wrote. They also raised concerns about ongoing attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq by Iranian-backed militias and called for the administration to prioritize the release of American citizens held in Iran: Baquer Namazi, Siamak Namazi, Morad Tahbaz and Emad Shargi. The lawmakers further called it “critical” for the administration to consult with key Middle East allies — Israel and Gulf nations – on a “path forward with Iran.” The bipartisan letter from senators follows an initiative by Democratic and Republican lawmakers in the House. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of 140 House lawmakers called on the Biden administration to take a “comprehensive” approach to threats posed by Iran beyond engagement on the nuclear deal.

News article:
One of the unidentified individuals informed the outlet that the proposal is “more than anything about trying to get the conversation started” between the two countries, which have been at odds for decades and saw tensions hit a new boiling point under the Trump administration. A looming expiration to an agreement between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is also serving as a push to establish renewed talks. The deal between the pair allows the UN watchdog to continue inspections of its nuclear facilities, but is due to expire in June and take with it the agency’s access to Iranian facilities. Shahrokh Nazemi, the head of press at Iran’s mission to the United Nations, responded to the Politico revelation by indicating that “the [deal] needs no specific proposal,” and that the US just needs to follow implementation of the 2015 agreement. The Biden camp did not offer details of the ongoing diplomatic talks. In 2018, the Trump administration walked away from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which in turn re-imposed sanctions on Iran, and initiated even stricter financial hurdles as Trump sought a “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran. As a result, Tehran has taken several steps against denuclearization and argues that since the US abandoned the deal first, they should take the first step in renegotiating and ultimately removing sanctions. Biden stated on the campaign trail that he wanted to reverse his predecessor’s actions against Iran. However, he has been working under the assumption that he will either remake or at least update the 2015 deal. Most recently, the Biden White House has stated that sanctions will not be lifted unless Iran returns to compliance with the original deal. Reports have indicated that the US is willing to make the first move in returning to negotiations. Biden is facing increased tension in competition as Iran continues its attempt at nuclear growth including signing a $400 billion deal with China, which includes investment into the renewable energy and nuclear energy infrastructure. — Permanent Mission of China in Vienna (@ChinaMissionVie) March 29, 2021 ​European officials have also attempted to salvage the agreement, setting up talks between Iran and the US, an effort subsequently rejected by both parties. — Saeed Khatibzadeh (@SKhatibzadeh) February 28, 2021 ​Europe faces its own challenge of encountering US sanctions of their own if they attempt to do business with Iran.

News article:
By desperately seeking Iran's return to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear accord, the Biden administration is squandering the vast economic leverage bequeathed to it by the Trump administration. President Joe Biden is encouraging Iran to play hardball in negotiations pertaining to its return to compliance with the nuclear deal. It has just been announced that the United States will participate in a meeting in Vienna on Tuesday with Iran. Also included will be the other signatory members of the nuclear accord — Britain, China, France, Germany, and Russia. But while the U.S. is expected to play a passive role in these discussions, the Iranians evidently believe that they now hold the strategic initiative. Iran's Fars News state media outlet reported one Iranian official's comment on Friday that no negotiations were necessary. This is because, the official said, "The United States can return to the agreement and end lawbreaking just in the way that it pulled out of it and imposed illegal sanctions against Iran." This is not the rhetoric of a regime desperate for sanctions relief. This is the rallying cry of a regime that senses appeasement has returned to American foreign policy. Biden is making a huge mistake. The appropriate way to deal with Iran is for Biden to hold true to what he pledged to do in early February — to keep all U.S. sanctions in place until Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suspends his enrichment of uranium beyond purity caps imposed under the 2015 accord. That strategy would ensure that Iran's leaders are the ones begging for a deal, rather than the other way around. It would also recognize the basic reality that Iran's economic collapse, precipitated in large part by the Trump administration's sanctions, has greatly damaged the patronage relationships upon which Tehran's hard-liner elite root their power. These sanctions have also restrained the regime's ability to export the revolution. Unfortunately, the Biden administration now appears willing to sacrifice this leverage. On Friday, an administration official told the New York Times that "the United States would not seek to retain some sanctions for leverage ... arguing that the previous 'maximum pressure' campaign waged against Iran by the Trump administration had failed." This is absurd. The Biden administration has the very same access to U.S. intelligence reporting on Iran as the Trump administration did. In turn, Biden and his senior officials should be confident that were they willing to maintain sanctions pressure, Iran would be forced into a desperate negotiating stance. Absent that desperate negotiating, the regime's very survival would come under question. Recent years have seen escalating street protests and a fundamental collapse of the Revolutionary Guard Corps finance structures. How much more of that strain can Khamenei's regime handle? It's a question he most certainly does not want to answer. Intelligence on this reality is surely why Biden was willing to play hardball back in February. It's not clear why Biden abandoned his previously prudent strategy. But the shift in Biden's position is obvious. Washington is even now begging the Chinese to persuade the Iranians to give some ground. The Chinese have, of course, loved this show of desperation from Washington and delivered nothing in return. On the contrary, Beijing has just given Iran the economic gift of a 25-year strategic partnership. Iran is now sitting pretty. Expect Biden to suspend major U.S. sanctions in return for Iran's reduction of some enrichment activities. Iran will get its payday and the fundamental flaws of the 2015 accord, such as Iran's ballistic missile research, will remain in place.

EXCLUSIVE: More than 300 Iranian-American activists on Wednesday wrote to President Biden urging him to support a democratic and secular Iran, and not to ease sanctions until the regime in Tehran ends human rights abuses -- as negotiations on reviving the Iran deal begin. "Your administration’s impactful actions must be directed towards blocking the Iranian regime’s violation of human rights, and their export of terrorism in the region and beyond," the letter from more than 300 American-Iranians, including physicians, engineers and professors, says. "As you craft your policy, defending human rights and democracy in Iran should be the central and enduring element of your policy on Iran." US, IRAN DUE TO BEGIN INDIRECT NUCLEAR TALKS IN VIENNA The letter is part of a continued effort from pro-democracy Iranian dissidents and groups, who call for a democratic, secular and non-nuclear Iran, to urge the Biden administration to keep up the pressure on the regime, which was dialed up during the Trump administration. The Trump-era White House adopted a "maximum pressure" strategy against the regime, reimposing sanctions and withdrawing the U.S. from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- known as the Iran nuclear deal. POMPEO SAYS BIDEN MOVES ON IRAN, HOUTHIS PRECURSORS TO RE-ENTERING 'CRAZY, CRAPPY' NUCLEAR DEAL Biden has indicated he wishes to re-enter the U.S. into the agreement, and his administration has abandoned a push at the United Nations to "snapback" U.N. sanctions -- including an expired arms embargo -- on the country. However, Biden has also indicated that sanctions relief will not happen until Iran is also back in the nuclear agreement -- seemingly ruling out sanctions relief as a precursor to negotiations. The signers of the letter say they are "encouraged" by that pledge, but warn of what they say is a "fable" that there is a moderate faction inside the regime that can be given power. "After trying to years to find such an elusive faction, the world has realized that the Iranian regime in its totality is an unchangeable dictatorship that cannot give birth to a less repressive government," it says. The letter calls on Biden to develop a roadmap and policies that "side with the Iranian people and their legitimate desire for a free, secular and democratic Iran, and will end the Iranian regime’s malign and dangerous expansion of its terrorism in the world, and funneling Iranian people’s resources to fund extremists in the region, as Iranians chant ‘leave Syria alone, think about us.'" "Furthermore, no sanctions relief or concessions should be provided to the Iranian regime, unless that regime verifiably ends its human rights abuses in iran and terrorism abroad, and abandons its destructive support for proxies in the region," it says. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The letter comes after envoys from Russia, China, Germany, France, Britain and Iran met in Vienna, and as the U.S. was due to start its own indirect talks with Iran -- as part of a global effort to bring both Iran and the U.S. back to the Iran deal. Professor Kazem Kazerounian, one of the lead organizers of the letter, noted that the talks in Iran are going on in Vienna, where a potential terrorist plot against the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) in Paris was planned. He said that many of the co-signers of the letter were also targets of the 2018 plot. "The signatories know the terrorism of the Iranian regime firsthand," he said. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

News article:
Biden’s new Iran Deal must rein in Tehran’s proxies Dr. Azeem Ibrahim Joe Biden will lift sanctions on Iran that are inconsistent with the Iran deal. (Getty Images) Short Url https://arab.news/zcqy6 President Joe Biden has announced that he is preparing to lift sanctions on Iran inconsistent with the Iran deal. There is no doubt the Obama administration’s Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), colloquially called the “Iran Deal,” was a great achievement of diplomacy; decades after the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979, Washington, London, Tehran and others managed to come together and agree to an international treaty. Nevertheless, the JCPOA was critically flawed, in a way that made it unsustainable from the outset: It may have successfully contained Iran’s nuclear capacity, but left Tehran free rein to attack other US interests and allies in the Middle East through its long-established, extensive network of proxies dedicated to that goal. Iran funds, arms, trains, and helps direct many factions, such as the Assad government in Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Palestinian occupied territories, the Houthis in Yemen, and in recent years even the Afghan Taliban. On top of that, Iran has sustained a number of smaller terrorist groups and cells that have carried out attacks against US diplomatic and military assets for decades. Read the full report on Arab News Research & Studies here. A Democrat-led Washington could wear those excesses and fight that fight in isolation of the JCPOA. But any Iran hawk could later come in and use the activities of those proxies against American interests in the region as a pretext to sink the JCPOA and set the US on the path of direct military confrontation with Tehran. And Washington certainly has no shortage of figures keen to do just that. So yes, it is imperative that Biden resurrects the “Iran Deal” to make sure Tehran does not acquire nuclear weapons. The only other way to potentially stop it from achieving that goal is war, which, in the aftermath of Iraq, should obviously be avoided. Iran is a much bigger and more powerful country than Iraq was, and among the people of Iran, even those who loathe the government would hate Western intervention even more, and would rally against invading forces. That is to say nothing of the fact that Iran has close economic and strategic ties to both Russia and China, who would aid Tehran’s efforts to defend itself. Conflict is not only a morally wrong course of action: It would be ruinous for America’s interests. Washington may not lose the war, but they would likely lose the peace. But if war is to be avoided during this and subsequent administrations, treaties between the US and Iran to guarantee peace need to be politically sustainable. Future US presidents must not have easy pretexts to rescind the agreements and re-initiate hostilities. That primarily means Tehran must be constrained from continuing its proxy war against the US in the Middle East. Iran funds, arms, trains, and helps direct many factions, such as the Assad government in Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Palestinian occupied territories, the Houthis in Yemen, and in recent years even the Afghan Taliban. Dr. Azeem Ibrahim Of course, this works both ways. Tehran is also replete with anti-American hawks, and their own nationalist conservatives have strong political incentives to undermine any détente with the US and instigate direct confrontation. For this reason, Washington must also make concessions. Above all, it must publicly acknowledge that it was former President Donald Trump who reneged on the JCPOA first, that Tehran complied with the agreement itself despite its malign activities in the region, and that the people of Iran perhaps deserve some compensation for the economic hardship following the reimposition of sanctions by Trump. Read the full report on Arab News Research & Studies here. All those things are true, and recognising them as such must be the foundation of any good faith effort to rebuild the nuclear agreement. But in exchange for that good faith, it should be demanded of Iran that it respond with equal good faith and stop funding every proxy and terrorist group opposed to the US in the region. An agreement must be reached, because failure is almost certain to lead to a war with no winners: Both sides will lose status, money, power and the lives of their soldiers, and millions of innocent people caught in the middle will suffer and die needlessly. That is a scenario no one can afford. Dr. Azeem Ibrahim is a director at the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy in Washington DC.

News article:
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei strongly criticized efforts of President Joe Biden's administration and European leaders to return the Persian Gulf nation to its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal, slamming the "false words" of the United States. The 2015 agreement—officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—is a treaty that promises Iran sanctions relief and international investment in exchange for the nation curbing its nuclear program. Former President Barack Obama's administration pushed through the accord alongside leaders from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the European Union, Russia and China, but former President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimplemented harsh sanctions against Iran. Biden's administration is now working to restore the international pact and bring Iran back into compliance. But Khamenei signaled Wednesday that Iran was not willing to compromise its position. "The US is not after accepting the truth through #negotiations. Rather, it seeks to impose its false words. The Europeans have also confessed in some private meetings with our officials that #Iran is in the right, & they acknowledge our policy that sanctions must be removed first," Khamenei wrote in a series of Twitter posts. The US is not after accepting the truth through #negotiations. Rather, it seeks to impose its false words. The Europeans have also confessed in some private meetings with our officials that #Iran is in the right, & they acknowledge our policy that sanctions must be removed first. — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) April 14, 2021 Taking aim at Europe and the U.S., he said the "suggestions they make are often arrogant and degrading, thus they aren't even worth looking at." Khamenei called the U.S. an "aggressor" and said Europeans "follow the U.S. because they don't have any true independence." Nevertheless, when it comes to making decisions, the same Europeans follow the U.S. Because they don’t have any true independence and the U.S. is an aggressor too. The suggestions they make are often arrogant and degrading, thus they aren’t even worth looking at. — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) April 14, 2021 At the same time, Khamenei suggested Iran would be willing to return to the agreement if its demands are met. He expressed a desire for Iran's negotiators to "enjoy divine success." "We have already declared #Iran's policy. #Sanctions must be removed first. Once we are certain that has been done, we will carry out our commitments. This is because they have broken their promises tens of times, and it is the same now," the Iranian leader wrote. We have already declared #Iran's policy. #Sanctions must be removed first. Once we are certain that has been done, we will carry out our commitments. This is because they have broken their promises tens of times, and it is the same now. — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) April 14, 2021 A State Department spokesperson told Newsweek in an email that Iran and the U.S. share "a common objective" to restore the JCPOA. "The United States and Iran have stated a common objective of returning to mutual compliance with the JCPOA. We have been engaged constructively in a diplomatic process to achieve that goal," the spokesperson said. "In Vienna last week, we explored concrete approaches concerning the steps both Iran and the U.S. would need to take to return to compliance. The U.S. delegation is in Vienna this week for the resumption of talks and the working groups in order to discuss a possible mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA." After Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reimplemented harsh sanctions, Iranian leaders repeatedly negotiated with European leaders, as well as Russia and China, to preserve the JCPOA. A year after the Trump administration walked away from U.S. commitments, Iran announced that it would begin enriching uranium and stop abiding by its commitments under the international agreement. Meanwhile, European leaders, Russia and China repeatedly expressed their displeasure with the Trump administration's policy toward Iran. During his campaign, Biden—who served as vice president when Obama signed the agreement—said he would work on returning to the international accord and indirect talks have moved forward with European leaders. Although Iranian officials have shown a willingness to talk, one of the negotiators said this week that Iran would begin enriching uranium up to 60 percent purity, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday. The country had already been enriching uranium up to 20 percent. Updated 10:57 AM ET, with comment from the State Department.

The U.S. delegation is in Vienna this week for the resumption of talks and the working groups in order to discuss a possible mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA." After Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reimplemented harsh sanctions, Iranian leaders repeatedly negotiated with European leaders, as well as Russia and China, to preserve the JCPOA. A year after the Trump administration walked away from U.S. commitments, Iran announced that it would begin enriching uranium and stop abiding by its commitments under the international agreement. Meanwhile, European leaders, Russia and China repeatedly expressed their displeasure with the Trump administration's policy toward Iran. During his campaign, Biden—who served as vice president when Obama signed the agreement—said he would work on returning to the international accord and indirect talks have moved forward with European leaders. Although Iranian officials have shown a willingness to talk, one of the negotiators said this week that Iran would begin enriching uranium up to 60 percent purity, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday. The country had already been enriching uranium up to 20 percent. Updated 10:57 AM ET, with comment from the State Department.

News article:
Two lawmakers have written to President Biden urging him to place human rights, and holding human rights abusers accountable, at the center of his Iran policy -- just as a resolution backing a secular and democratic Iran has picked up majority support in the House. The resolution, introduced by Reps. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., and Brad Sherman, D-Calif., backs "the Iranian people’s desire for a democratic, secular, and nonnuclear Republic of Iran" and condemns "violations of human rights and state-sponsored terrorism by the Iranian Government." BIPARTISAN HOUSE RESOLUTION BACKS PUSH FOR A DEMOCRATIC IRAN, CONDEMNS REGIME'S TERROR PLOTS It is similar to a resolution introduced last year which also picked up majority support in the House. Introduced in February, it now has more than 220 co-sponsors across the political spectrum, meaning it has majority support. Sherman and McClintock wrote to Biden, touting the resolution and urging him to keep human rights a central part of the policy toward Tehran. "We believe this resolution deserves the attention of your administration because it emphasizes three important pillars, all of which should play a central role in your administration’s policy towards Iran: democracy, human rights, and holding human rights abusers accountable," the lawmakers write. Both the resolution and the letter note "egregious" human rights violations by the theocratic regime currently in control in Tehran -- including the deaths of more than 1,000 protesters in anti-government protests. The resolution is backed by Iranian dissident groups, such as the Organization of America-Iranian Communities and the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) -- whose leader’s 10 point plan is explicitly backed in the resolution. NCRI President-elect Maryam Rajavi backed the resolution and warned against making concessions to the regime. "Experience has shown that no amount of political and economic concessions will change the behavior of the regime," she said. "On the contrary, it will only embolden the mullahs to continue suppressing the Iranian people, terrorism and warmongering, and pursuing nuclear weapons." IRAN'S LONG HISTORY OF TERROR AND AGGRESSION In response to the letter, a senior administration official told Fox News that the Biden administration will "continue to call out and stand up to Iran’s human rights abuses, which include large-scale arbitrary or unlawful detention of individuals, some of whom have faced torture and execution after unfair trials." IRAN’S FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS JOHN KERRY TOLD HIM ABOUT ISRAELI COVERT OPERATIONS IN SYRIA The official also said the administration will continue to maintain sanctions on Iranian entities perpetuating human rights abuses and use "all appropriate tools" to promote accountability for those engaging in human rights abuses, and to hold Iran accountable. The resolution comes as talks are underway in Vienna to bring the U.S. and Iran back into the Iranian nuclear deal -- from which the Trump administration withdrew in 2018, in favor of a "maximum pressure" campaign that reimposed waves of sanctions on Iran. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Biden administration has looked to re-enter the accord, while ending a push to reimpose U.N. sanctions on Tehran -- which has drawn criticism from former Trump administration officials. Meanwhile, former Secretary of State John Kerry, who is now serving as a climate envoy in the administration, is facing criticism over allegations he shared information about Israeli operations in Syria with the Iranian foreign minister -- allegations that Kerry has described as "unequivocally false."

News article:
Conservative hardliner Ebrahim Raisi has registered as a candidate in Iran's presidential elections which he is favored to win, potentially complicating talks between President Joe Biden and the Islamic Republic over its nuclear program. Biden wants to restore the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) struck between Tehran and Washington, DC in 2015 which promised Tehran economic incentives for curbing its nuclear program. Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump scuppered the deal, reimposing heavy sanctions to try to strongarm Tehran into new talks. Ongoing talks in Vienna between Tehran and the P4 + 1 group of countries has revived hopes of both a new nuclear deal as well as a rapprochement between Iran and the United States. However, Raisi, who currently heads the judiciary, had previously taken aim at the terms of the nuclear deal struck by incumbent Hassan Rouhani, who is constitutionally barred from running for president again. During the 2017 presidential campaign he lost, Raisi criticized Rouhani's "weak efforts" in negotiating the JCPOA, according to the Arab Weekly. The publication also reported that Raisi has the support of a wide range of conservatives and hardliners, who want to expand Iran's nuclear program. Meanwhile, Raisi's background as a hardline judge has raised concerns among reformists and rights groups. In the 1980s, he was among judges who imposed death penalties on thousands of political prisoners, Reuters reported. Raisi is a former attorney general and custodian of the Astan Quds Razavi which manages the Imam Reza shrine and was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2019 for human rights violations. Moves to broker an agreement on Iran's nuclear program comes amid a more positive attitude towards the U.S. in Iran since Biden took office. A survey by IranPoll in conjunction with the University of Maryland CISSM in February found a majority (51 percent) of Iranians approved of the JCPOA, compared with only 44 percent in October 2020. However, a clear majority (69 percent) said that Iran should not get involved in nuclear talks until the U.S. returns to the JCPOA and fulfills its obligations. Only 28 percent agreed that Tehran should immediately pursue a new nuclear agreement in talks with the United States. Raisi promoted his domestic policy credentials in his statement on Saturday, saying that focus of his candidacy would be to "fight poverty, corruption, humiliation and discrimination." "I have come as an independent to the stage to make changes in the executive management of the country," he added, according to Reuters. On Saturday, Ali Larijani, a former adviser to the supreme leader also signed up for the election on June 18 in which over 59 million people are eligible to vote. But there is expected to be a low turnout due to economic problems, international isolation, and a lack of basic freedoms, the Atlantic Council said this month. Analysis for the think tank by Shahin Milani said that it was uncertain whether the president would even have a "material impact" on Iran's domestic of foreign policy. "The presidency of the Islamic Republic is not as important or politically relevant as foreign observers might believe it to be," the piece said.

News article:
London, Tehran - Asharq Al-Awsat Reformists in Iran are at a critical crossroads of either backing the country’s First-Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri or former Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani in upcoming presidential elections. Larijani had distanced himself from conservatives after supporting the cleric-led country’s nuclear deal with world powers. On Monday, Iran’s Guardian Council, which is charged with interpreting the constitution and supervising elections, kicked off intensified meetings to review the applications of those willing to run in the presidential race slated for June 18. Guardian Council Spokesman Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei said that the Council would examine 40 out of about 600 applications submitted to the Iranian Interior Ministry in the last five days. A few hours after the candidates’ requests were studied, Islah-Press reported on Telegram that the Council refused to approve Expediency Council secretary and ex-commander of Revolutionary Guards General Mohsen Rezai. According to Islah-Press, another presidential hopeful refused by the Council was Gen. Saeed Muhammad, who is the executive director and second brigadier general in the Revolutionary Guard and commander of its economic branch, “Khatam-al Anbiya Construction.” Kadkhodaei rushed to deny the rumors in a statement published on the Council’s official website. In the statement, Kadkhodaei urged Iranians to ignore unverified news circulated by the media and hinted that those leaking information about candidacies before their official approval would be pursued by the judiciary. Iranian reformist Mohammed Ali Abtahi told the Iranian Labor News Agency (ILNA) that the “tsunami” of filed presidential bids last Saturday confused all equations, especially conservatives backing Ebrahim Raisi before Saeed Jalili entered the election scene. It is worth noting that Jalili is an advisor to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Abtahi called for “upholding the constitution” in approving the candidacy of presidential runners from both political currents. “Participation is at risk,” Abtahi warned, explaining that voter turnout affects both reformists and conservatives.

News article:
Iran on Tuesday approved seven hopefuls to run in next month's presidential poll, a list dominated by ultraconservatives and deemed "indefensible" by one senior official. The election-vetting Guardian Council disqualified moderate conservative Ali Larijani, in a surprise move that could clear the way for a strong run by ultraconservative judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi in the June 18 election. The announcement comes with Iran engaged in talks with world powers aimed at reviving a nuclear deal that has been on life support since former US president Donald Trump's unilateral withdrawal from it in 2018. Raisi won 38 percent of the vote in the 2017 presidential election but was defeated by Hassan Rouhani, a moderate who is constitutionally barred from holding office for three consecutive terms. "I have never found the council's decisions to be so indefensible, whether in approvals or disqualifications," said Ayatollah Sadegh Amoli Larijani, a former judiciary chief, current member of the 12-man body and brother to Ali. The cleric took to Twitter to accuse "security bodies" of increasingly influencing the vetting body through "false reports". The remarks by Amoli Larijani, also a member of the Assembly of Experts and the head of the powerful Expediency Council, who was replaced by Raisi at the helm of the judiciary in 2019, amount to rare criticism from a high-ranking establishment figure. The Guardian Council also barred firebrand former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, as it did when he registered to be a candidate in 2017. Ahmadinejad has yet to comment on his disqualification. He had said before that if not approved, he would "not participate" in the election, either by backing a candidate or voting. The list announced by the interior ministry sparked criticism from reformists and even conservatives. "I have never seen the Guardian Council criticised and blasted so much from the far right to the far left," said reformist journalist Mostafa Faghihi on Twitter. The press had widely predicted a showdown between Raisi and Larijani, who is currently an adviser to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Reformists had pinned their hopes on Eshaq Jahangiri, first-vice president to incumbent Rouhani, but he was also barred. Jahangiri said the disqualifications posed "a serious threat to public participation and fair competition," especially for reformists. Kian Abdollahi, editor-in-chief of ultraconservative Tasnim news agency, said the council's decision was not "justifiable to the public" and that "a major part" of conservatives opposed it. A record 57 percent of Iranians stayed away from legislative elections in February last year in which thousands of candidates, many of them moderates and reformists, were disqualified. Turnout is still a concern this year, with officials including the supreme leader urging Iranians to vote. The Guardian Council's decision was criticised by members of the public. The move turned the election into a mere formality, said an engineer in Tehran who only identified himself as Majid. "It used to be disguised, but it's not even disguised anymore," he told AFP. "For me, it doesn't really matter who's going to be (president), because whoever it is, nothing will change," said fitness instructor Farnoosh. The government deflected reports that Rouhani had called on Khamenei to intervene by bringing some candidates back in. "I don't have the latest information," its spokesman said. The leader had in 2005 reversed the council's decision to bar two reformist figures, Mostafa Moein and Mohsen Mehralizadeh, with the latter an approved candidate this year. The final list announcement comes as global powers meet in Vienna in efforts to bring Washington back into a deal over Iran's nuclear programme, which the US left in 2018. The withdrawal under Trump and re-imposition of US sanctions led to Iran stepping up its nuclear activities. Larijani, who was a key domestic backer of the 2015 deal, conceded his disqualification on Tuesday. "Dear nation of Iran; now that the election was decided to be so, I have fulfilled my duty," he wrote on Twitter. "I am content with God's will," he wrote. Many political figures and analysts said there was hardly a competition any more, as the disqualification of Raisi's main rivals should allow him an easy victory. They include ex-Revolutionary Guards chief Major General Mohsen Rezai, ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, and ultraconservative MPs Alireza Zakani and Amirhossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi. The list also includes reformist ex-vice president Mehralizadeh, and central bank governor Abdolnasser Hemmati, deemed close to the left.

News article:
The Guardian Council has barred establishment candidate Ali Larijani from the presidential race. That says a lot about Iran's political culture. During a virtual session with Iranian MPs on Thursday, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei defended the Guardian Council decision to exclude a spate of moderates — including Ali Larijani — from the presidential election on June 18. The Guardian Council has the prerogative to vet all candidates based on their ideological stance and loyalty to Iran's political order. Council members not only excluded former parliamentary speaker Larijani, but also acting Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri. The decision sparked fierce criticism, especially on social media. Ali Larijani has been squeezed out of the presidential race Image: picture-alliance/AP Photo/V. Salemi In a letter to Khamenei, President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday urged a rethink on the mater. According to news agency AFP, Rouhani stressed that "at its heart, elections are about competition; if you take that away, they are like a corpse." Sadiq Larijani defends brother The radical move was also condemned by Ali Larijani's brother Sadiq Larijani, who has served on the Guardian Council since 2001, and headed Iran's judicial system between 2009 and 2019. Ali Larijani was the moderate candidate thought to have the best chances of succeeding President Rouhani. Sadiq Larijani took to Twitter to complain that his brother had been disqualified "based on false information from the secret service." Indeed, rumors have circulated that Ali Larijani's daughter Fatemeh has emigrated to the US. Apparently she does not, however, possess US citizenship, which would have disqualified her father from the presidential race. Sadiq Larijani, meanwhile, asserts "falsehoods" had been deliberately spread among the Guardian Council to discredit his brother. Reformists squeezed out of race Iran's Guardian Council is comprised of twelve members. Six members ― all Islamic clerics ― are appointed by supreme leader Ali Khamenei. The remaining six are lawyers, suggested by the head of Iran's judiciary and approved by parliament. Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei can appoint and dismiss six members of the powerful Guardian Council Image: Irna One of the candidates running for the presidency is Iran's judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi. With Larijani gone, his chances have risen substantially. "Larijani's surprising disqualification will have far-reaching consequences," Iran analysist Ali Afshari told DW's Farsi service. Afshari, who lives in US exile, was a supporter of Iran's more reform-oriented forces. He was arrested on several occasions and sentenced to jailtime, most recently in 2005, when he called for an election boycott after the Guardian Council disqualified moderates from running. Afshari said Larijani's disqualification dashes all hope that elections will help reform Iran's political system. It showed, he told DW, that "the heart of Iran's political system, overseen by its religious leader, expects complete loyalty and does not tolerate criticism." Too outspoken? Ali Larijani's rejection illustrates just how intolerant the Guardian Council is of dissenting views. It's all the more surprising in light of Larijani's background. His father is late Grand Ayatollah Haj Mirza Hashem Amoli, after all. Moreover, Larijani is married to the daughter of influential Shia scholar Ayatollah Morteza Motahhari. He is also an aide to Khamenei, albeit not a member of his close circle. "This is primarily because he never spoke out against opposition figures Mehdi Karroubi and Mir Hossein Mousavi, who were placed under house arrest in 2010," Afshari told DW. Larijani also "openly criticized Ebrahim Raisi and members of the Revolutionary Guard." Iran: Theocracy vs. democracy To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Sham election Larijani is considered a close ally of moderate President Rouhani. And he supports reviving the Iran nuclear deal. Ali Fathollah-Nedschad, a political scientist and Iran expert, told DW that by excluding moderate candidates like Larijani, Iran is headed for a sham election that is even less believable than previous polls. With a hardline president in office, he said, Iran's hardline Revolutionary Guards would gain yet more influence in the country. This, by extension, would also enhance their impact on the economy. Iran's hardliners are looking to take over all power in Iran — regardless of how disappointed the electorate is, or how low voter turnout will be, for that matter. One survey shows that it could stand at a mere 30%. This article has been adapted from German.

News article:
Embed from Getty Images The decision by Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, not to interfere with the “Guardian Council” decision and to keep the list of the presidential candidates intact, guarantees the election of a conservative candidate for president of Iran. Hassan Rouhani’s presidency seems to have sharpened the understanding of how well a president who is familiar with Iran’s political system – especially one supported by Rouhani such as Ali Larigny – can be a “bone in the throat” that could impede significant moves the leader is seeking to promote, especially preparing the ground for selecting his successor. The role of president in Iran is not symbolic or negligible in Iranian politics. Although it is Iran’s leader who makes the vast majority of strategic decisions in the country, the president who heads the government, thus allowing the supreme leader to address the more significant issues (in his view) and especially the spiritual guidance of his Shi’ite loyalists. Sometimes the fact that the president did not come from classical conservative circles (such as Khatami, Ahmadinejad, and certainly Rouhani) enabled Khamenei to roll the blame on the president regarding Iran’s problems. However, the upcoming Iranian presidential elections to be held on June 18th are unusual. Although Iran’s supreme leader could overturn the decisions of the Guardian Council (which aims to “screen” disloyal candidates ), he preferred not to intervene in this decision. Thus, the fact that there are only conservative candidate will significantly increase the alienation between the Iranian regime and the population. In addition, the Iranian leader will find it difficult to find a non-conservative “scapegoat” to pin the blame on the state of the Iranian economy, for example. However, Khamenei seems willing to take the risk because of the fact that these elections are crucial for the question of Khamenei’s successor. Khamenei is 81, has been suffering from cancer for years and talk of possible candidates to replace him has begun to proliferate in recent years. Khamenei assume that In order to ensure an inheritance process in which his candidate is elected, he must place conservative candidates at the main decision points in Iran. Thus, it seems that in the upcoming presidential elections, Ibrahim Raisi, head of Iran’s judiciary, who is supposed to be the next leader or at the very least promote the candidacy of Khamenei’s candidacy (his son MUjtaba, or another conservative candidate) will probably win. One main reason behind the regime’s decision to prevent a “moderate conservative” candidate from being presented is related to the concerns that another loss by Raisi (like in the 2017 elections) would cause him to lose all public legitimacy to replace Khamenei, severely undermining the legitimacy of the conservatives and even Khamenei himself, who did not hide his support for him. Advertisement In addition, Khamenei may be concerned that as he gets older, his abilities to withstand the surge of attempts by Rouhani and his men to get closer to the West are weakening, so he must make sure that, in the long term, the Islamic revolution will not change its nature. As for Israel, this is supposedly excellent news, Raisi’s election prevents any thoughts in the West about a possible change taking place in Iran, determines the regime’s dogmatic view, and strengthens those who oppose any contact with Tehran. In addition, it is important to note that Khamenei’s conduct increases dissatisfaction among the population in Iran, and along with the dire economic situation, the chances of renewed demonstrations in the country increase. On the other hand, it is important to note that Raisi’s expected election and the expected weakening of the moderate camp ensures that Iran will continue its dogmatic policy vis-à-vis Israel, And even escalating its actions in a way that could lead the two countries into an inevitable confrontation.the fact that there will be no one in the Iranian leadership who can stand against the IRGC deeply troubling and could lead Iran to make more “courageous” decisions. Bottom line, Khamenei’s desire to dominate Iran’s political system before the twilight of his rule has pushed him not to interfere in the Guardian Council’s decision, and to leave the presidential elections to conservative candidates only. This decision will help Israel in its massaging campaign against Iran, but without proper Checks and balances in the Iranian leadership, the chances of direct confrontation between Israel and Iran are increasing.

News article:
Iran regime doing all it can to ensure Raisi becomes president Dr. Majid Rafizadeh Iranian Presidential candidate Ebrahim Raisi speaks during a campaign meeting at the Mosalla mosque in Tehran, Iran, May 16, 2017. (Reuters) Short Url https://arab.news/mvdsr In spite of the Iranian regime’s claims that it holds democratic presidential elections, the system is fundamentally an authoritarian one disguised as a democracy. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in February boasted about the regime’s political system and the people’s important role in influencing and shaping the political establishment. He said: “The Islamic revolution transformed the rule of a country from a despotic monarchy into a popular, democratic republic run by the people. Today, the nation of Iran rules over its own destiny. It is the people who choose. They may make a right choice or a wrong choice, but it is they who choose. This is very important.” But the reality is that ordinary people do not run the system in Iran and they have little to no influence in choosing who runs the country. To make it clear, the supreme leader is not an elected individual. How can a country be democratic, as Khamenei claims, when people cannot choose the overall leader, who enjoys the final say over the nation’s domestic and foreign policy issues and who is the chief of Iran’s military institutions, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), its elite branch the Quds Force, and the paramilitary group the Basij? Since the unelected supreme leader appoints the IRGC’s senior generals and the head of the judiciary, the regime’s military and judicial apparatuses also have a distinctly undemocratic character. What remains to be examined in the system are the positions of the president and the parliamentarians. Article 6 of Iran’s constitution stipulates: “In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the country’s affairs must be administered by reliance on the public vote, and through elections. These will include the election of the president, the deputies of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the members of the councils, and other such institutions, or through a referendum in such instances as are determined in other articles of this document.” But the Iranian regime has a solution to circumvent this: By presenting a facade of democratic elections while effectively eliminating people’s influence in choosing their president and members of the parliament. This is carried out by the regime’s clerical body, the Guardian Council. The Guardian Council is an unelected body of 12 officials, six of whom are appointed directly by the supreme leader and six indirectly. The latter six are nominated by the head of the judiciary, who is himself appointed by the supreme leader. The Guardian Council has a history of arbitrarily disqualifying reform-minded candidates, women and those who are perceived as disloyal to the principles of the state and the Islamic revolution from running for office. The authority to do so is granted by the constitution, which states: “The qualifications of the candidates for presidency, with respect to the conditions set forth by the constitution, must be confirmed by the Guardian Council prior to the general elections and approved by the leader for the first term.” As a result, people only get to choose between a few individuals selected by the regime. Despite this, Khamenei last month insisted that Iran’s elections are flawless, saying: “All elections held by the Islamic Republic have been totally flawless. There might have been certain issues and offenses, but none of them had a significant impact on the result of elections. Those who raise fraud claims do so because of being defeated.” Of course, it should not come as a surprise that, from the perspective of Iran’s supreme leader, the elections are flawless, as he can pick the candidates he wants to be president. Anyone who might have had a chance of defeating Khamenei’s pick for president has been disqualified. Dr. Majid Rafizadeh For this year’s presidential election, which will take place on June 18, the regime has disqualified anyone who might have had a chance of defeating Ebrahim Raisi, who is Khamenei’s pick for president. The Guardian Council has even disqualified top regime insiders such as Ali Larijani, not because it questions their loyalty to the supreme leader and the revolutionary ideals of the Islamic Republic, but simply because Khamenei seems to want someone else to be president of Iran this time. The regime is cognizant of the fact that Raisi is extremely unpopular in Iran — he lost the previous election to the so-called moderate Hassan Rouhani by a landslide. Rouhani received about 23.5 million of the 41 million votes cast, while Raisi received 15.7 million. This time around, the regime does not want to risk Raisi suffering another defeat. For one thing, Khamenei is 82 years old and it is believed that he sees Raisi as the perfect cleric to succeed him. In addition, at these critical times, when people’s frustration toward the regime has reached its peak, the hard-liners not only want to control the judicial and legislative branches, but also the presidential office. Khamenei and the senior cadre of the IRGC believe they can suppress opposition more effectively and end the growing power struggle between the moderates and the hard-liners by having control of all branches of the Islamic Republic. In a nutshell, the Iranian regime is paving the way for Khamenei’s pick, Raisi, to become the next president. Dr. Majid Rafizadeh is a Harvard-educated Iranian-American political scientist.

News article:
This handout photo provided by the office of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Friday shows him addressing the nation during a live TV speech on the occasion of the 32nd death anniversary of late supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (AFP photo) TEHRAN — Iran's supreme leader on Friday urged voters to turn out for this month's presidential election, warning that staying away would mean doing the work of the "enemies of Islam". Iranians are set to elect a successor to President Hassan Rouhani on June 18 amid widespread discontent over a deep economic and social crisis. "Some want to give up the duty to participate in the election with absurd reasons," Khamenei said, in a televised speech. "It is the will of the enemies, the enemies of Iran, the enemies of Islam and the enemies of religious democracy." The presidential election campaign kicked off on May 28, without fanfare and in an atmosphere of indifference, as many say the result is a foregone conclusion. Khamenei last week made similar calls urging people not to heed calls to boycott the poll. The opposition based outside Iran is running a campaign on social media networks calling for people to stay away from the polls, using hashtags in Farsi such as #NototheIslamicRepublic. "It has been said that some people are reluctant to go to the ballot box due to the pressures on their livelihoods, which we all know and experience," Khamenei said, adding that such problems are solved "by making the right choice, not by not choosing". He also quoted the Islamic republic's late founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, saying that, under certain circumstances, to abstain from voting is "one of the worst deadly sins". Iran's conservative-dominated Guardian Council approved seven candidates — five ultraconservative and two reformists — to run from a field of about 600 hopefuls. Ultraconservative judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi, who took 38 per cent of the vote in the 2017 presidential election, is widely seen as a favourite. Rouhani, who is constitutionally barred from running for a third consecutive term, has warned of the risk of low turnout. A record 57 per cent of Iranians stayed away from parliamentary elections in February last year in which thousands of candidates, many of them moderates and reformists, were barred from running. The election comes at a critical time amid talks with world powers aimed at reviving a 2015 nuclear deal that offered sanctions relief in return for Iran's agreement to tight controls on its nuclear programme. The accord has been on life support since then-US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018, and reimposed crippling sanctions.

This handout photo provided by the office of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Friday shows him addressing the nation during a live TV speech on the occasion of the 32nd death anniversary of late supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (AFP photo) TEHRAN — Iran's supreme leader on Friday urged voters to turn out for this month's presidential election, warning that staying away would mean doing the work of the "enemies of Islam". Iranians are set to elect a successor to President Hassan Rouhani on June 18 amid widespread discontent over a deep economic and social crisis. "Some want to give up the duty to participate in the election with absurd reasons," Khamenei said, in a televised speech. "It is the will of the enemies, the enemies of Iran, the enemies of Islam and the enemies of religious democracy." The presidential election campaign kicked off on May 28, without fanfare and in an atmosphere of indifference, as many say the result is a foregone conclusion. Khamenei last week made similar calls urging people not to heed calls to boycott the poll. The opposition based outside Iran is running a campaign on social media networks calling for people to stay away from the polls, using hashtags in Farsi such as #NototheIslamicRepublic. "It has been said that some people are reluctant to go to the ballot box due to the pressures on their livelihoods, which we all know and experience," Khamenei said, adding that such problems are solved "by making the right choice, not by not choosing".

News article:
Asharq Al-Awsat Iran held a final presidential debate Saturday that showed the fissures within the country’s politics, as hardliners referred to those seeking ties to the West as “infiltrators” and the race’s two other candidates brought up the unrest that surrounded Tehran’s disputed 2009 election. Analysts and state-linked polling put hardline judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi as the clear front-runner in Friday’s upcoming vote, with the public now largely hostile to the relative moderate President Hassan Rouhani after the collapse of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. But that didn’t stop Rouhani’s former Central Bank chief Abdolnasser Hemmati from harshly criticizing Raisi, at one point getting up from his chair to hand him a list he described as naming individuals who haven’t paid back huge loans from state banks. He again tried to link Raisi to former President Donald Trump, whose decision to unilaterally withdraw America from Iran’s nuclear deal has seen the country crushed by sanctions. “Mr. Raisi, you and your friends have played in Trump’s ground with your extremist policies,” Hemmati said. For his part, Raisi called Hemmati’s move a stunt and said he’d make sure the government returns to the nuclear deal. The deal “would not be executed by you, it needs a powerful government to do this,” Raisi said. The election Friday will see voters pick a candidate to replace Rouhani, who is term limited from running again. The vote comes amid tensions with the West as negotiations continue to try and resuscitate the nuclear deal, which saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The debate took on the pattern of the previous ones, with hardliners focusing their criticism on Hemmati as a stand-in for Rouhani. Hard-liner Alireza Zakani went as far to accuse Hemmati of committing a “huge treason” by sharing financial information to the International Monetary Fund. Hardline former Revolutionary Guard chief Mohsen Rezaei described the Rouhani government as being run by “infiltrators.” Hemmati has raised eyebrows in recent days after telling The Associated Press in an interview he’d be potentially willing to speak with President Joe Biden. He also warned that without deals with the wider world, Iran’s economy would see no growth. “What will happen if the hardliners have power?” Hemmati asked. “I tell you there is going to be more sanctions with global consensus.” It remains unclear if the debates will affect voters’ opinions. The state-linked Iranian Student Polling Agency suggested just 37% of Iranian adults watched the second debate. There also remains the larger concern about turnout in the election. Officials in the past have pointed to turnout as a sign of popular support for Iran’s theocratic government. As of now, ISPA estimates turnout will be around 41% of Iran’s over 59 million eligible voters. That would the lowest percentage since Iran’s 1979 revolution. ISPA polling also puts Raisi as the front-runner with enough of a percentage to avoid a runoff. But unlike the earlier debates, both Hemmati and an inconspicuous reformist candidate named Mohsen Mehralizadeh brought up mass protests that directly challenged the government. Mehralizadeh at one point asked Raisi to intervene with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to pardon people still held after nationwide demonstrations in November 2019 over price rises of state-subsidized gasoline. Those demonstrations ended with one lawmaker suggesting 7,000 people had been arrested. Amnesty International put the death toll from the violence at at least 208, with the rights group saying security forces killed demonstrators. Iran has yet to offer any definitive account of what happened. Responding later to Mehralizadeh, Raisi said most of those arrested “have been pardoned by the supreme leader, except those who had relations with other countries or had other issues.” He offered no figures for those pardoned and those still detained. The 2019 demonstrations were the deadliest since Iran’s 2009 presidential vote that saw hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected amid a disputed result that gave rise to the Green Movement protests. “What happened to our youth during these 12 years that changed their chants from ‘Where is my vote?’” to ‘No way I’m voting?’” Hemmati asked at one point.

News article:
Asharq Al-Awsat Iran's ex-parliament speaker Ali Larijani on Saturday demanded an explanation of why he was barred from running in next week's presidential poll but was promptly rebuffed by the election watchdog. The moderate conservative was disqualified by the powerful Guardian Council in a surprise move that leaves judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi, an ultraconservative, the clear favorite in the June 18 election. Larijani called on Twitter on the Guardian Council to "officially and publicly disclose all the reasons" for his disqualification as reports on him and his family had been "proven to be false". The council's spokesman in response said the law does not mandate the body to explain its reasoning in public. The vetting process is carried out using "adequate and trustable documents", Abbas Ali Kadkhodaee said in a tweet reported by local agencies. "The presidential election law has not specified anything regarding protesting disqualifications and public disclosure of their reasons," he said. The conservative-dominated, unelected council has approved seven candidates, five of them ultraconservatives, to run in the election from a field of about 600 hopefuls. In addition to Larijani, who serves as advisor to supreme leader Ali Khamenei, it also barred first vice-president Eshaq Jahangiri and firebrand former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The disqualifications have unleashed a flood of criticism, including from a member of the 12-man council. Sadegh Amoli Larijani, a former judiciary chief and brother to the ex-speaker, said "security bodies" were influencing the council's decisions through "false reports". President Hassan Rouhani, who is constitutionally barred from running for a third consecutive term, said last month he had sent a letter to Khamenei asking him to intervene and ensure greater "competition" in the election. The supreme leader in a May 27 speech urged voters to ignore boycott calls but turned a deaf ear to criticism of the vetting process. A week later, however, he said some candidates had been treated "unjustly" as "they and their families were accused of false things", without giving names. The Guardian Council said "false reports" had not influenced its decisions.

Asharq Al-Awsat Iran's ex-parliament speaker Ali Larijani on Saturday demanded an explanation of why he was barred from running in next week's presidential poll but was promptly rebuffed by the election watchdog. The moderate conservative was disqualified by the powerful Guardian Council in a surprise move that leaves judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi, an ultraconservative, the clear favorite in the June 18 election. Larijani called on Twitter on the Guardian Council to "officially and publicly disclose all the reasons" for his disqualification as reports on him and his family had been "proven to be false". The council's spokesman in response said the law does not mandate the body to explain its reasoning in public. The vetting process is carried out using "adequate and trustable documents", Abbas Ali Kadkhodaee said in a tweet reported by local agencies. "The presidential election law has not specified anything regarding protesting disqualifications and public disclosure of their reasons," he said. The conservative-dominated, unelected council has approved seven candidates, five of them ultraconservatives, to run in the election from a field of about 600 hopefuls. In addition to Larijani, who serves as advisor to supreme leader Ali Khamenei, it also barred first vice-president Eshaq Jahangiri and firebrand former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The disqualifications have unleashed a flood of criticism, including from a member of the 12-man council.

News article:
On the eve of Iran's presidential election, expected to hand victory to the ultraconservative cleric Ebrahim Raisi, the candidate-vetting Guardian Council insisted Thursday that "the political contest is serious". "The media and the people have testified that this is a good competition," said the head of the 12-member council, Abbas Ali Kadkhodaee, a day before almost 60 million voters are asked to head to the ballots. Three televised debates between the seven candidates, all men, who were approved by the unelected body of jurists and clerics, had shown that "the political competition is serious," Kadkhodaee told a news conference. The vote Friday will choose a successor to Iran's moderate President Hassan Rouhani, who cannot run again now after serving two consecutive four-year terms, and who leaves office in August. Turnout is expected to be low in a country where many have been demoralised by years of painful economic crisis that was brought on by a crippling US sanctions regime and worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic. "I left my main job because I could not pay the rent for my shop, and my (former) employees are now jobless," lamented Tehran resident Nasrollah, who said he had been a car mechanic for 47 years. "I have no money. All families are now facing an economic problem. How can we vote for these people who did this to us? It's not right." The election comes as Tehran holds renewed talks with world powers to revive a battered 2015 nuclear deal, which the United States unilaterally withdrew from three years ago under then president Donald Trump. Ultimate power in Iran lies with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but the president has significant influence on issues from industrial policy to foreign affairs. Many voters were dismayed however when a field of almost 600 hopefuls for the presidency was reduced to just seven candidates by the Guardian Council. Among the prominent figures barred from running were former parliament speaker Ali Larijani, who demanded that the council "officially and publicly disclose all the reasons" for his disqualification. Rouhani later said he had urged greater "competition" in a letter to the supreme leader, who acknowledged that some candidates had been treated "unjustly" as "they and their families were accused of false things", without giving names. The field was further reduced Wednesday when three of the seven candidates dropped out, shortly before the election campaign ended at 7:00 am (0230 GMT) Thursday. The only reformist left in the race against Raisi and two other ultraconservatives is the relatively low-profile central bank chief Abdolnasser Hemmati. Kadkhodaee said Thursday that the candidates were vetted according to "the electoral law" and that "the Guardian Council has no political views". Raisi, Iran's judiciary chief who dresses in a black turban and religious robe, belongs to the ultraconservative camp that most deeply distrusts the United States, labelled the "Great Satan" and the "Global Arrogance" in official rhetoric. He has been mentioned in Iranian media as a possible successor to Khamenei, who turns 82 in July. Khamenei also served as president when he took over in 1989 upon the death of the Islamic republic's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei. In a televised speech on Wednesday, Khamenei urged voters to turn out in droves to elect "a powerful president", warning that "the Satanic power centres of the world" are trying to undermine the ballot. But some disillusioned Iranians said they planned to stay away from the polls. Maryam, an employee, said that "not voting is a form of protest". "If there were a candidate I approved of, I would vote."

News article:
Iranians are heading to the polls to pick the next president of the country. Ebrahim Raisi, Iran’s judiciary chief, is expected to secure a comfortable win, with most political heavyweights barred from running. Polling stations opened across Iran on Friday, with around 60 million people eligible to vote. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was the first to cast a ballot, as he urged everyone to vote. “Each vote counts… come and vote and choose your president… this is important for the future of your country,” Khamenei said. The outgoing president, Hassan Rouhani, called on citizens to “make our friends… all Iranians happy and our enemies disappointed,” by showing a high turnout. The election is not expected to hold much intrigue, with Iran’s judiciary chief and close ally of Khamenei, Ebrahim Raisi, projected to secure a solid win. Hardliner Raisi also ran in 2017, losing by a wide margin of almost 20% to the incumbent president, Rouhani, who is barred from running again due to legal limitations allowing two consecutive four-year terms, which he has already served. Raisi is already the subject of sanctions imposed on Iran by Washington. The high-profile official was targeted by the US after he was appointed as judiciary chief in 2019, with Washington accusing him of involvement in the execution of political prisoners in the 1980s and the suppression of unrest in the late 2000s. While more than 600 people submitted bids to the Guardian Council, a 12-member panel directly under Khamenei, only seven candidates made through it. The panel disqualified political heavyweights such as hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who served as president from 2005 to 2013, as well as former parliamentary speaker, conservative Ali Larijani. Also on rt.com Iran announces 7 approved candidates for upcoming elections, ex-president Ahmadihejad barred from running The decisions of the council against some of the presidential hopefuls were criticized by Khamenei himself. The supreme leader said some of the disqualifications were unjust, urging the panel to reverse some of the decisions. “Some candidates were wronged. They were accused of untrue things that were unfortunately spread throughout the internet too. Protecting people’s honor is one of the most important issues. I call on the responsible bodies to restore their honor,” Khamenei said earlier this month. The Guardian Council, however, said its rulings were final and did not reverse any of the bans.

News article:
With the majority of votes counted, the 60-year-old arch-conservative cleric is set to succeed moderate President Hassan Rouhani. Iran's ultraconservative cleric and judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi has won the presidential election, the country's foreign minister said Saturday. Mohammad Javad Zarif made the announcement a day after Iranians voted in a contest that was marred by boycotts and a low turnout. Raisi won 62% of the vote with about 90% of ballots counted from Friday's election, poll officials said. Victory over 'enemy propaganda' Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hailed the election as a victory for the nation over "enemy propaganda." "The great winner of yesterday's elections is the Iranian nation because it has risen up once again in the face of the propaganda of the enemy's mercenary media," Khameini said. Outgoing moderate President Hassan Rouhani also said in a televised speech on Saturday that his successor had been elected, without naming the winner. "I congratulate the people on their choice," said Rouhani. "My official congratulations will come later, but we know who got enough votes in this election and who is elected today by the people." Other contestants — including two ultraconservative candidates, Mohsen Rezaei and Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, and reformist Abdolnasser Hemmati — explicitly congratulated Raisi. Raisi will succeed Rouhani, who could not run again after serving two consecutive four-year terms. He leaves office in August. Reformists banned from fielding candidates To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Low voter turnout Over 59 million Iranians were eligible to vote at home and abroad in Friday's election. In the run-up, however, Iranian opposition groups abroad and some dissidents at home had called for a boycott of the vote they see as an engineered victory for Raisi. Hundreds of moderates were barred from contesting the election by the nation's Guardian Council. Turnout appeared far lower than in Iran's last presidential election in 2017, when over 70% of eligible voters cast their ballot. Opinion polls suggested the turnout was around 44%. What do we know about Raisi? Raisi, 60, has been the head of the nation's judiciary since 2019 and belongs to the ultraconservative camp that most deeply distrusts the United States. He is notorious for his involvement as a prosecutor in the execution of thousands of political prisoners in the late 1980s. The EU and the US have imposed sanctions on Raisi for his role in the human rights violations that happened in Iran during the nationwide anti-government protests in 2019. Rights group Amnesty International on Saturday renewed a call for Raisi to be investigated for his role in human rights violations in the country. "We continue to call for Ebrahim Raisi to be investigated for his involvement in past and ongoing crimes under international law, including by states that exercise universal jurisdiction," Amnesty Secretary-General Agnes Callamard said in a statement. Raisi's win would also give more power to Iranian hard-liners amid ongoing talks in Vienna to revive the 2015 nuclear deal struck by Iran and world powers. Raisi has harshly criticized President Rouhani since the nuclear deal began to unravel under former US President Donald Trump's administration. During the election campaign, Raisi vowed to keep up the fight on graft, construct 4 million new homes for low-income families, and build "a government of the people for a strong Iran." What could a Raisi presidency mean for Iran? The election came at a critical juncture for Iran. The nation's economy is struggling to cope with the harsh US sanctions imposed by the Trump administration, after Washington left the international nuclear deal. The revival of sanctions plunged the economy into recession, and Rouhani came under fire from ultraconservatives for having trusted the West. The country of 83 million is currently blocked by the US from selling its oil to and trading with much of the world. As president, Raisi would be confronted with the nation's dire economic situation and foreign policy challenges. But even though the president has significant influence to set direction on a wide range of issues, from economic policy to foreign affairs, ultimate power in Iran lies with the supreme leader, Khamenei. Nevertheless, many observers see Raisi as a possible successor to Khamenei, who turns 82 next month, as supreme leader. sri/mm (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)

"We continue to call for Ebrahim Raisi to be investigated for his involvement in past and ongoing crimes under international law, including by states that exercise universal jurisdiction," Amnesty Secretary-General Agnes Callamard said in a statement. Raisi's win would also give more power to Iranian hard-liners amid ongoing talks in Vienna to revive the 2015 nuclear deal struck by Iran and world powers. Raisi has harshly criticized President Rouhani since the nuclear deal began to unravel under former US President Donald Trump's administration. During the election campaign, Raisi vowed to keep up the fight on graft, construct 4 million new homes for low-income families, and build "a government of the people for a strong Iran." What could a Raisi presidency mean for Iran? The election came at a critical juncture for Iran. The nation's economy is struggling to cope with the harsh US sanctions imposed by the Trump administration, after Washington left the international nuclear deal. The revival of sanctions plunged the economy into recession, and Rouhani came under fire from ultraconservatives for having trusted the West. The country of 83 million is currently blocked by the US from selling its oil to and trading with much of the world. As president, Raisi would be confronted with the nation's dire economic situation and foreign policy challenges. But even though the president has significant influence to set direction on a wide range of issues, from economic policy to foreign affairs, ultimate power in Iran lies with the supreme leader, Khamenei. Nevertheless, many observers see Raisi as a possible successor to Khamenei, who turns 82 next month, as supreme leader. sri/mm (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)

News article:
With the majority of votes counted, the 60-year-old arch-conservative cleric is set to succeed moderate President Hassan Rouhani. Iran's ultraconservative cleric and judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi has won the presidential election, the country's foreign minister said Saturday. Mohammad Javad Zarif made the announcement a day after Iranians voted in a contest that was marred by boycotts and a low turnout. Raisi won 62% of the vote with about 90% of ballots counted from Friday's election, poll officials said. Victory over 'enemy propaganda' Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hailed the election as a victory for the nation over "enemy propaganda." "The great winner of yesterday's elections is the Iranian nation because it has risen up once again in the face of the propaganda of the enemy's mercenary media," Khameini said. Outgoing moderate President Hassan Rouhani also said in a televised speech on Saturday that his successor had been elected, without naming the winner. "I congratulate the people on their choice," said Rouhani. "My official congratulations will come later, but we know who got enough votes in this election and who is elected today by the people." Other contestants — including two ultraconservative candidates, Mohsen Rezaei and Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, and reformist Abdolnasser Hemmati — explicitly congratulated Raisi. Raisi will succeed Rouhani, who could not run again after serving two consecutive four-year terms. He leaves office in August. Reformists banned from fielding candidates To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Low voter turnout Over 59 million Iranians were eligible to vote at home and abroad in Friday's election. In the run-up, however, Iranian opposition groups abroad and some dissidents at home had called for a boycott of the vote they see as an engineered victory for Raisi. Hundreds of moderates were barred from contesting the election by the nation's Guardian Council. Turnout appeared far lower than in Iran's last presidential election in 2017, when over 70% of eligible voters cast their ballot. Opinion polls suggested the turnout was around 44%. What do we know about Raisi? Raisi, 60, has been the head of the nation's judiciary since 2019 and belongs to the ultraconservative camp that most deeply distrusts the United States. He is notorious for his involvement as a prosecutor in the execution of thousands of political prisoners in the late 1980s. The EU and the US have imposed sanctions on Raisi for his role in the human rights violations that happened in Iran during the nationwide anti-government protests in 2019. Rights group Amnesty International on Saturday renewed a call for Raisi to be investigated for his role in human rights violations in the country. "We continue to call for Ebrahim Raisi to be investigated for his involvement in past and ongoing crimes under international law, including by states that exercise universal jurisdiction," Amnesty Secretary-General Agnes Callamard said in a statement. Raisi's win would also give more power to Iranian hard-liners amid ongoing talks in Vienna to revive the 2015 nuclear deal struck by Iran and world powers. Raisi has harshly criticized President Rouhani since the nuclear deal began to unravel under former US President Donald Trump's administration.

News article:
A woman holds a poster of Iran’s newly-elected president Ebrahim Raisi, with text in Persian reading ‘Government of the people, strong Iran’, as supporters celebrate his victory in Imam Hussein square in the capital Tehran, on Saturday (AFP photo) TEHRAN — Iran’s ultraconservatives on Sunday hailed the election victory of their candidate Ebrahim Raisi, after Washington charged the vote was unfair and Tehran’s arch-foe Israel labelled him the “most extremist” president yet. Raisi, 60, won Friday’s election in which more than half the voters stayed away after many political heavyweights had been barred from running and as an economic crisis driven by US sanctions has battered the country. An austere figure from the Shiite Muslim clerical establishment, Raisi takes over from the moderate incumbent Hassan Rouhani, who must leave office in August after eight years in power. Raisi, whose black turban signifies direct descent from Islam’s Prophet Mohammad, is seen as close to the 81-year-old supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate political power in Iran. “The Dawn of a New Era,” read the jubilant front-page headline of the conservative Resalat daily, welcoming the 62 percent win by Raisi, the head of Iran’s judiciary. Raisi was congratulated by Russia, Turkey and several Gulf states, and by Iran’s regional allies including Syrian President Bashar Assad, Lebanon’s Hizbollah and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Raisi’s victory had been widely anticipated after the Guardian Council, made up of 12 clerics and jurists, had approved just seven candidates, all men, out of a field of almost 600 hopefuls. Three of those vetted candidates dropped out two days before the vote. Iran’s moderate Jomhouri-e Eslami daily highlighted that conservatives had now cemented their hold on power, from parliament and the Guardian Council to the court system and armed forces. Using a touch of irony, its editorial said that “we, the people of Iran, owed the conservative faction a homogeneous government” and “the people have delivered”. ‘Epic’ turnout Turnout reached 48.8 per cent, a record low for a presidential poll since Iran’s 1979 revolution ousted the US-backed monarchy. The ultraconservative Kayhan daily argued that voter participation was “epic” considering the economic crisis, COVID pandemic and the “enemy’s propaganda”, referring to boycott calls from Iranian opposition groups abroad. The Resalat daily welcomed the change from the Rouhani administration which it said has been dogged by political infighting and occupied with “fruitless domestic and foreign challenges”. Rouhani’s landmark achievement was the 2015 deal with world powers under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. That deal has however been hanging by a thread since then-US president Donald Trump withdrew from it in 2018 and launched a “maximum pressure” campaign to diplomatically and economically isolate Tehran. While Iran has always denied seeking a nuclear weapon, Trump charged it was still planning to build the bomb and was destabilising the Middle East through armed proxy groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Since Trump’s successor Joe Biden took office this year, talks involving Iran and the remaining parties to the accord — Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia — have resumed in Vienna, with the US taking part indirectly. ‘Anti-Western views’ Iran’s ultraconservatives — who deeply distrust the United States, labelled the “Great Satan” in the Islamic republic — bitterly attacked Rouhani over the failing deal and for having trusted the West. But Raisi has nonetheless said Iran should keep negotiating with the aim of ending the punishing sanctions that have largely cut the country of 83 million off from global markets and financial systems. The US State Department said after Raisi’s election win that Washington would continue talks over Iran’s nuclear programme, working with its allies and partners. A spokesperson charged however that “Iranians were denied their right to choose their own leaders in a free and fair electoral process”. In Israel, which has engaged in a shadow conflict with Iran for years, foreign ministry spokesman Lior Haiat said the Islamic republic had “elected its most extremist president to date”. Raisi was “committed to Iran’s rapidly advancing military nuclear programme”, Haiat wrote on Twitter. “His election makes clear Iran’s true malign intentions, and should prompt grave concern among the international community.” Israel’s new Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said that Raisi’s election is “the last chance for the world powers to wake up before returning to the nuclear agreement and to understand who they are doing business with”. Analysts for think thank the Eurasia Group said Raisi’s election win would likely not derail the ongoing Vienna talks to salvage the nuclear deal. But they warned that “his hardline, anti-Western views are a sharp break from the more moderate stances of Rouhani and will have a significant impact on Tehran’s relationship with the outside world”. EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell, speaking about the Vienna talks, said: “We are very close... So I hope that the result of the election is not going to be the last obstacle that will ruin the negotiation process. “As far as I know... this is not going to be the case. It is not a matter of this president or another, it is the understanding of what is at stake.”

Iran Sends a Message to Biden The new president shows who really runs the Islamic Republic. https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-sends-a-message-to-biden-11624130662?mod=opinion_lead_pos1 The Islamic Republic of Iran isn’t a real democracy. But the result of Friday’s presidential election still reveals important truths about the government that the U.S. and Europe are trying to appease on nuclear weapons. Ebrahim Raisi, the country’s chief justice, won the presidency with about 62% of the vote, according to preliminary results published Saturday. Sometimes discussed as a potential successor to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei —who wields the real power in Iran, particularly over foreign affairs—Mr. Raisi had the race wrapped up before the polls opened. The Guardian Council, Iran’s election watchdog, has long barred candidates not to the Supreme Leader’s liking. But past races have been competitive and even unpredictable, giving Iranians a small voice in deciding their future. Approved candidates are always loyal to the Islamic Republic and its revolutionary ideology. But some, like lame-duck President Hassan Rouhani, spoke the language of moderation and reform even as they followed the Khamenei line. Iranians understand they live in a dictatorship but have often voted in high numbers to choose their least bad option. Initial results suggest this year’s race had turnout around 50%—down from more than 70% four years ago and the lowest of any vote since 1979. Millions decided to boycott this year’s election as the country’s already small spectrum of permissible views grew even smaller. Last month the Guardian Council culled dozens of candidates, including many ostensible centrists or reformers. Of the seven candidates approved to run, three dropped out shortly before the contest—paving the way for Mr. Raisi, who is typically described as a hard-liner or ultraconservative cleric. In 1988 Mr. Raisi facilitated the extrajudicial execution of thousands of dissidents. He later called the killings “one of the proud achievements of the system.” In 2009, during the Green Revolution after a stolen election, he served as deputy chief justice when peaceful protestors were prosecuted and sometimes given death sentences. In 2019 the Trump Administration imposed sanctions on Mr. Raisi over the myriad human-rights violations committed during his rise through the Iranian legal system. Will the Biden Administration, which has been negotiating a return to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, lift sanctions on the president-elect? Defenders of the nuclear accord argue that by leaving the deal Donald Trump weakened reformers and empowered men like Mr. Raisi. But conservative clerics have had ultimate power in Iran since the 1979 revolution. Mr. Khamenei supported the accord because it is favorable to the regime. It offers tens of billions of dollars in financial aid and trade revenue while merely delaying the day it can build a bomb. “We will be committed to the JCPOA as an agreement that was approved by the Supreme Leader,” Mr. Raisi said this month, referring to the nuclear deal’s official name. The folly of the Obama and now Biden administrations is believing that the leaders in Tehran want Iran to be a normal country. They don’t. They run a government that wants to spread its religious revolution to the rest of the world by whatever means possible. Mr. Raisi’s ascension shouts that reality from the minaret, not that the Biden Administration wants to hear it. Comments are closed.

The Health Ministry announced Wednesday that starting next week, it will begin vaccinating children aged 12-16 against coronavirus. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The move followed several weeks of consultations with experts after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted emergency authorization to give the relevant age group the Pfizer vaccine used in Israel. 4 View gallery A teenager being vaccinated against coronavirus at a clinic in Tel Aviv Though an official date has not yet been given, Maccabi and Clalit HMOs announced they will begin inoculations on Sunday, with people able to book an appointment starting Thursday. The ministry said that in light of the country's low infection rates, children in that age group who are at risk from the virus will be the first advised to get the shots, along with those living with family members who are likewise at risk of serious illness. Families who are planning to travel abroad will also be included in the first round of vaccinations, alongside anyone else who wants to vaccinate their children. The ministry said that vaccination would not be compulsory for the age group and parents will be able to decide if they want their children to get the shots. 4 View gallery A coronavirus testing facility at Ben-Gurion Airport ( Photo: Reuters ) Earlier Wednesday it was announced that Home Front Command has ceased operating coronavirus testing centers due to the low infection rate in the country. The ministry said that from now on, COVID tests would only be performed at HMO clinics and only for symptomatic patients or those who had come into contact with verified carriers. On Tuesday, a Health Ministry study found a small number of heart inflammation cases in males under the age of 30 after the second Pfizer vaccine shot. 4 View gallery A healthcare worker holding a vial of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine ( Photo: AFP ) In Israel, 275 cases of myocarditis were reported between December 2020 and May 2021 among more than 5 million vaccinated people, the ministry said in disclosing the findings of a study it commissioned to examine the matter. Most patients who experienced heart inflammation spent no more than four days in hospital and 95% of the cases were classified as mild, according to the study, which the ministry said was conducted by three teams of experts. The study found "there is a probable link between receiving the second dose (of Pfizer) vaccine and the appearance of myocarditis among men aged 16 to 30," it said in a statement. Pfizer has said it has not observed a higher rate of the condition than would normally be expected in the general population. 4 View gallery Israelis without face masks enjoy the spring sunshine in Tel Aviv ( Photo: EPA ) Israel has been a world leader in its vaccination rollout.

Some 600,000 Israelis aged 12-15 are eligible to receive a vaccine against the coronavirus from Sunday. Thousands have already booked appointments through the country’s health maintenance organizations (HMOs), according to Saturday reports. The move comes six months after Israel began its vaccination drive for adults, and after the US Food and Drug Administration okayed the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the age group. Some HMOs have already vaccinated children under 16 in at-risk groups and have seen no significant side effects from the shot. According to the plan, children in that age group who are at greater risk of suffering severe symptoms from coronavirus infection will be the first advised to get the shots, along with those living with family members who are likewise at risk of serious illness. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Families that are expecting to travel abroad will also be included in the first round of vaccinations, the ministry said. The ministry stressed to The Times of Israel that vaccination will not be compulsory for adolescents, only advised, and parents will be able to decide if they want their children to get the shots. On Tuesday it was reported that a member of the Health Ministry panel that has been advising on COVID-19 vaccinations received death threats during the process of approval for the inoculation of children. Advertisement Prof. Galia Rahav of Sheba Medical Center received threatening messages from anti-vaxxers online, including images of tombstones with her name and a “pulsa dinura,” a Jewish death curse that literally translates as “lashes of fire,” Kan news reported. The hospital said it was coordinating with police over the threats and will provide Rahav with security at all times. Israel’s mass vaccination drive, which has already given both shots to over half the population, along with lockdown measures, brought down the number of new daily cases (based on a weekly average), from 8,600 at the peak of the health crisis to just 19 on Sunday. On Tuesday, the last of a series of restrictions in place for over a year lapsed as case numbers continued to fall. The only major restrictions remaining are the mandate requiring masks to be worn indoors, expected to be lifted soon as well, and quarantine requirements for those entering the country. At the height of the pandemic, there were 88,000 active cases in the country and 1,228 serious cases; as of Friday, there were 199 active infections and 39 people in serious condition. Since the beginning of the outbreak early last year, 839,539 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in Israel and there have been 6,417 deaths from the disease.

By Yisrael Price YERUSHALAYIM — The Israeli health ministry said on Sunday that not a single new native case of covid was detected over the past twenty four hours, the first time that could be said since the outbreak over a year ago. The ministry noted that four cases were recorded over Shabbos, but all of those originated abroad. Health minister Yuli Edelstein said on Sunday, that providing the situation remains stable, all mask-wearing regulations can be cancelled in nine days, on June 15. As of now, masks are still required in indoor public places. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Edelstein attended an appreciation ceremony at the Jerusalem Theater for health system personnel and partner agencies for their contribution to the fight against the coronavirus. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla addressed the gathering by videoconference. Netanyahu said that “Israel’s victory was achieved thanks to two basic elements: The millions of vaccines that we brought to the country and their rapid distribution to the citizens of Israel. This morning we also began vaccinating young people aged 12-16. This is huge news; it promises us herd immunity.” Kurz said: “I would like to thank you, Bibi, for our good cooperation in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. It was you who first alerted me about the massive danger of the coronavirus at the beginning of last year. Following your warnings, we took hard measures very early in Austria last year, which helped us to get through the first wave quite effectively… “With a view to the future waves, I would like to enhance the cooperation on research and development and vaccine production with Israel and Denmark.” Pfizer’s Bourla similarly commended the Israeli effort and Netanyahu in particular. “As many life science companies in the world, Pfizer has collaborated with many governments around the world to fight this pandemic, but nowhere has this collaboration been more effective than in Israel. “Israel has done the most amazing job in mobilizing their healthcare system and delivering the most successful vaccination campaign in the world. “During my discussions with the Israeli government, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convinced me that Israel would be the ideal place to demonstrate to the world what a fast vaccination campaign can achieve. “But what Israel was able to eventually achieve exceeded all my expectations. To date, 57% of the Israeli population has been fully vaccinated. And recently published real-world data from Israel suggests that in its first 120 days, the country’s vaccination program with our vaccine prevented approximately 159,000 infections, 25,000 hospitalizations and 5,500 deaths,” Bourla said.

Police are reportedly probing whether coronavirus infections among 11 kids at a school in Modiin in central Israel were caused by a man who violated quarantine after returning from overseas. The Health Ministry filed a complaint with police against the man after the infections were detected among the 6th graders, Channel 12 news reports. The network quotes an investigation by the Health Ministry district branch as saying the suspect “did not fulfill the quarantine requirement in full upon his return from overseas and did not perform a [coronavirus] test on the ninth day, allowing him to shorten the quarantine from 14 days.” After the outbreak was detected, the rest of the students were sent to quarantine and the IDF’s Home Front Command was testing children in all grades for other potential infections.

Israel is set to unify all of its coronavirus vaccine certificates under one "unified pass" as the first jabs given to Israelis reache the six-month mark. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The country began its exceptionally high-paced vaccination campaign back in December that allowed Israel to become one of the first states in the world to fully reopen following the COVID-19 pandemic. 2 View gallery Teens getting vaccinated in Tel Aviv ( Photo: AFP ) The Health Ministry said the so-called unified pass will be available to Israelis in two weeks' time on June 30 and will be valid until the end of 2021. The certificate will consolidate the Green Pass issued to those who'd been given both vaccine shots and those who have recovered from the virus. "The ministry is working to create a unified pass that will replace the vaccine and recovery certificates. The launch of the unified certificate is expected in the near future, and currently it is expected to be valid until the end of 2021," said the Health Ministry in a statement. The ministry added that some of the passes for recovered COVID sufferers will expire soon, depending on when the person first contracted the virus. 2 View gallery People arrive at Ben Gurion Airport ( Photo: Amit Shaal ) Some of those who were infected with the disease early on will have their passes expire as soon as the end of June.

Israel is set to unify all of its coronavirus vaccine certificates under one "unified pass" as the first jabs given to Israelis reache the six-month mark. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The country began its exceptionally high-paced vaccination campaign back in December that allowed Israel to become one of the first states in the world to fully reopen following the COVID-19 pandemic. 2 View gallery Teens getting vaccinated in Tel Aviv ( Photo: AFP ) The Health Ministry said the so-called unified pass will be available to Israelis in two weeks' time on June 30 and will be valid until the end of 2021. The certificate will consolidate the Green Pass issued to those who'd been given both vaccine shots and those who have recovered from the virus. "The ministry is working to create a unified pass that will replace the vaccine and recovery certificates. The launch of the unified certificate is expected in the near future, and currently it is expected to be valid until the end of 2021," said the Health Ministry in a statement. The ministry added that some of the passes for recovered COVID sufferers will expire soon, depending on when the person first contracted the virus. 2 View gallery People arrive at Ben Gurion Airport ( Photo: Amit Shaal ) Some of those who were infected with the disease early on will have their passes expire as soon as the end of June.

Former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu deserves overall credit for Israel's triumph over the coronavirus pandemic. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter After leading Israel's trailblazing vaccination campaign, which flattened the infection curve and essentially wiped out the pathogen within the country, he finishes his tenure on the same week health authorities scrap the last major restriction on Israeli citizens — the indoor mask mandate. 5 View gallery Then-prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu receives a coronavirus vaccine at Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan, December 19, 2020 ( Photo: Reuters ) However, up until that victorious moment, Netanyahu had managed the crisis through personal political interests while repeatedly ignoring health officials' advice. A prime example of this would be his much-belated call to bar flights to and from the United States. While incoming flights from China were banned since January 30, hundreds of flights from the U.S. kept arriving unabated and while cases kept skyrocketing in the U.S., countless travelers entered Israel freely without quarantine. This all stemmed from Netanyahu's fear such a ban would harm U.S.-Israeli ties. It took him until March 9 to enjoin all arrivals to self-isolate. Israel paid a heavy toll for those several weeks of inaction. 5 View gallery Passengers wearing masks push trolleys at the departures terminal at Ben Gurion Airport ( Photo: Reuters ) A Health Ministry report from mid-April stated that 40% of Israelis who returned from abroad carrying the virus came from the United States. The report showed that 569 confirmed patients in Israel at the time had contracted the virus in the U.S., four times more than any other nation. This spike in cases mainly affected the ultra-Orthodox community whose COVID-19 infection and death rates significantly exceeded that of any other group. While Netanyahu should be credited for informing the public on any change in policy, many times his decisions were either made at the last minute or changed on a whim. The tone and tenor of Netanyahu's public announcements also rollercoastered from one to the other. 5 View gallery A coronavirus testing facility in central Israel ( Photo: AFP ) The beginning of the crisis was characterized by grimdark predictions, which thankfully did not come to fruition. In March, Netanyahu said that Israel could see tens of thousands of daily cases within a week, but as the first wave of infections ebbed away by the end of May, he failed to predict the next spike in infections and called on Israelis to go out and "have a good time." Another example of Netanyahu's shortcomings in handling the pandemic was him outright ignoring ultra-Orthodox educational institutions that remained open while non-Haredi students across the country were forced to go into distant learning. This unequal treatment stemmed first and foremost from pressure applied on him by his ultra-Orthodox government allies who demanded their communities' schools remain open despite soaring cases. 5 View gallery Netanyahu and then-health minister Yaakov Litzman ( Photo: EPA ) The fact Netanyahu did not do more to combat this phenomenon led to frequent tackles with health officials, chief among them was the country's first pandemic czar, Prof. Ronni Gamzu. In addition, the former prime minister's decision to hold a Passover dinner with his son Avner while young people across the country were forced to stay away from their families was particularly egregious, especially since he was supposed to be in quarantine at the time. Although his management of the pandemic was marred with lapses of judgment and errors, there was one decision Netanyahu had made that flipped everything on its head. At the end of the day, the one thing that managed to beat the virus quickly was not lockdowns or restrictions, but vaccines. 5 View gallery A healthcare worker speaks to an Arab Israeli woman before giving her coronavirus vaccine ( Photo: AFP ) Netanyahu, alongside Health Ministry officials, was able to secure agreements with major pharmaceutical companies that were developing the vaccines at a very early stage.

News article:
A senior health expert said on Monday that the coronavirus in Israel is under better control than in other countries despite the increased spread of the Delta variant that was observed in recent days. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Professor Ran Balicer, who heads a panel of medical professionals advising the Health Ministry said that the fact that most Israelis were already vaccinated against COVID-19 protected the country from a rise in morbidity. "There is no cause for panic," he said. 3 View gallery School children in Modi'in face masks after a coronavirus outbreak was detected there last week ( Photo: Yariv Katz ) Balicer said in an interview on Ynet, that the situation at the Ben Gurion International Airport, where a growing number of passengers were arriving from countries with high rates of contagion and over-crowding was hampering coronavirus testing efforts, was unfortunate. "We must understand that this is a complicated time because of the Delta variant of the virus," he said. The U.K. is the country most appropriate to compare Israel to because of their successful vaccine drive, but they have only vaccinated 60% of the adult population thus far compared to 85% in Israel," he said. "We may also see community spread here as was demonstrated in Britain, but our vaccinated population might prove to provide a better protection and any outbreaks detected, and we should be able to contain such outbreaks," Balicer said. "We may not be able to know how successful we can be, in advance," he said adding that great efforts were needed in the coming weeks, to prevent more cases from entering the country. Ynet has leaned that at close to 5,000 people arrived at Ben Gurion Airport from Russia in the past month and at least 31 of them had COVID-19, representing 0.63%, of passengers, the highest rate of cases recorded in Israel. 3 View gallery Israelis line up to be tested at the Ben Gurion International Airport in April But the Delta variant was already in the country, Balicer said and the airport was not the only source of its spread. "Vaccinated adults were for the most part protected by vaccines, but some could still be infected with 5%-10% of those exposed to the so-called UK variant susceptible and 10%-20% of those exposed to the Delta variant could be infected. 95% of those who received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine were protected enough to prevent serious illness or hospitalization," he said. Balicer said the Health Ministry was still evaluating data before making its final recommendation to vaccinate young teens age 12 to 15. "This is a complex matter," he said. "We are reviewing all the data accumulated by the ministry. We found that girls were less likely to suffer from unwanted side effects than boys," Balicer said. 3 View gallery A 14-year old girl receives her coronavirus vaccine in Tel Aviv earlier this month ( Photo: AFP ) "I would certainly recommend vaccinating the children in areas where an outbreak was detected. But since there is a higher risk for boys from a passing inflammation of the hear muscle, a side effect of the vaccine, I think the decision should be made in consultation between parents and their doctors until there is a final ministerial recommendation," he said. "I would certainly recommend all kids to receive their vaccines before overseas travel," Balizer said. The senior health official said the renewal of a mask mandate for indoor settings should not be imposed but a recommendation to use masks was warranted. "Ultimately it a matter of personal responsibility to protect our health," he said but added that that too would be part of the conversation inside the Health Ministry.

News article:
Amid a surge of new virus cases in Israel, there were 125 patients diagnosed on Monday, a figure more than twice the number detected the day before and the highest daily caseload since April 20. There were just 49 cases detected on Sunday. Health officials, blaming arrivals from abroad who did not adhere to quarantine rules as the prime cause of the outbreak, said Tuesday that increased fines will likely be introduced to punish violators. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, Transportation Minister Merav Michaeli, Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, and Public Security Minister Omer Barlev were to visit Ben Gurion Airport later in the day to review procedures for processing arrivals. “We will not hesitate to do what needs to be done,” said Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz earlier as he toured the Abarbanel Mental Health Center in Bat Yam. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Horowitz said that police will assist in enforcing quarantine rules and those who break them will face fines of up to NIS 5,000 ($1,530), the Walla news site reported. “We decided to increase enforcement. This loophole will be closed,” Horowitz said of Ben Gurion, where on Friday many incoming travelers were allowed to leave the airport without having been tested, due to long lines. In addition, national coronavirus czar Nachman Ash told the Kan public broadcaster that fines of around NIS 5,000 are expected to be introduced for those who travel to six prohibited countries where there are significant virus outbreaks. Advertisement “I have no doubt it will be a deterrent,” he said. The six countries currently on the Health Ministry blacklist are Russia, India, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and South Africa. Health Ministry director-general Chezy Levy said that officials are also planning to issue an order that masks be worn in schools in areas that have seen increased infection rate and where there is a virus spread in the local education system. The order will also apply to health centers. “The order will include wearing masks in all places where there is contact between a therapist and a patient, and certainly in places where there is a high risk,” he said “In crowded places, including crowded public transportation, it would be wise to wear a mask,” Levy said. “But this is not an order, this is an ongoing recommendation.” He also stressed that there are currently no plans to reapply recently lifted restrictions that had been used to bring down infection rates. Advertisement Testing has indicated that the Delta variant, which was first detected in India, is driving the outbreak, Levy said. Health Ministry figures released Tuesday showed that there are now 434 active virus patients in Israel. Of those diagnosed, at least 78 were children, according to Hebrew media reports, with virus cases detected in schools in Ramat Hashaon, Kfar Saba, Kochav Yair and Herzliya, among other places. The IDF said that two female soldiers and a civilian contractor have been diagnosed with COVID-19, despite all three of them having been vaccinated. The infected people were put into isolation in accordance with Health Ministry guidelines and testing will be done of other service personnel in relevant units, the army said. There are 89 active patients in the town of Binyamina, identified as a focal point of the recent resurgence of the virus, the highest number for any town in the country. The city of Modiin was next with 49 patients, followed by Jerusalem with 34. A panel of experts tasked with advising on the virus outbreak will convene on Wednesday to discuss the latest developments. Officials have expressed concern at the potential for the Delta variant to cause a relapse of the pandemic. Children are considered particularly vulnerable, as most are not vaccinated. Israel has begun offering vaccines to 12- to 15-year-olds, who previously were not included in the national vaccination plan, and in recent days health officials have increasingly advised that parents have their children inoculated. Bennett announced late Sunday that Israel would step up COVID-19 testing and restrictions at Ben Gurion Airport, as well as enforcement of quarantine for those arrivals required to self-isolate. Since the start of the outbreak last year 840,032 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in Israel, and there have been 6,428 deaths due to the virus.

Amid a surge of new virus cases in Israel, there were 125 patients diagnosed on Monday, a figure more than twice the number detected the day before and the highest daily caseload since April 20. There were just 49 cases detected on Sunday. Health officials, blaming arrivals from abroad who did not adhere to quarantine rules as the prime cause of the outbreak, said Tuesday that increased fines will likely be introduced to punish violators. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, Transportation Minister Merav Michaeli, Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, and Public Security Minister Omer Barlev were to visit Ben Gurion Airport later in the day to review procedures for processing arrivals. “We will not hesitate to do what needs to be done,” said Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz earlier as he toured the Abarbanel Mental Health Center in Bat Yam.

News article:
Ten days after returning to the country, some 3,000 Israelis still have not received results for the coronavirus tests administered to them at Ben Gurion Airport, Israeli television reported Monday. The Health Ministry told Channel 12 it was aware of the problem and that only people who tested negative for COVID-19 have not received the results. Many other incoming travelers were reportedly not getting the results until two days after they were tested. The network noted that the delays came several weeks after a new company took over the testing apparatus at the airport. Unlike Check2Fly, the previous firm that managed the tests, the new company — Femi Premium — does not process the swab samples at the airport itself, but sends them to laboratories it does not operate itself. Additionally, these labs do not update arriving travelers about the results, but tell the Health Ministry. The ministry then informs health maintenance organizations, which update those insured by them. Check2Fly informed travelers directly. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “There is no person whose test was positive and did not receive a response within 48 hours,” the Health Ministry said. The report came amid concerns over the entry of the more contagious Delta variant into the country and that infected travelers from overseas were helping fuel a renewed rise in coronavirus cases. Israelis who are vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 are exempt from quarantine upon returning to the country, unless returning from COVID-19 hotspots to which travel is barred. The countries that Israelis are currently banned from visiting are Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, India, Mexico, and Russia. Advertisement But according to Channel 12 news, travelers coming from those countries are arriving in Israel on private planes and entering without inspection. The report said that others coming from those countries on commercial flights are returning home from the airport using public transportation, posing a potential risk to those around them. Outgoing Health Ministry Director General Chezy Levy told the network that the situation at the airport “seems absurd,” admitting that results should ideally be given within 24 hours. The government on Sunday approved the issuing of a tender to set up a new coronavirus testing facility at Ben Gurion Airport, as part of efforts to increase testing capacity there. The network also aired a recording of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett imploring municipal leaders to encourage vaccination before some doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech shots that Israel acquired expire at the end of July. Bennett earlier Monday appealed to teenagers to get vaccinated by July 9. “To do the second shot by July 30, you need the first shot to be by July 9,” Bennett can be heard saying, referring to the 21-day period between doses. “It’s possible to also continue vaccinating after July 9, but then we’ll only get one shot, which is far less effective concerning the Delta variant.” He added: “It’s simply a crime not to get vaccinated in this window.” Advertisement Levy said Israel is looking to swap the doses set to expire next month for shots from other countries that have later expiration dates. He did not specify which countries. A separate report from the Kan public broadcaster said the ministry will destroy 800,000 vaccines worth hundreds of millions of dollars if no country agrees to purchase them in the next two weeks. Earlier this month, the Palestinian Authority agreed to, and then rejected, a deal for Israel to hand over the soon-to-expire vaccines in exchange for the PA’s shipment of fresh Pfizer shots, which are scheduled to arrive later in 2021. Health Ministry figures showed daily cases further rising, with 213 infections confirmed on Monday since midnight, up from the 145 recorded throughout the previous day. The number of active infection climbed to 1,425, though serious cases have continued to drop and were down to just 21. Another fatality — the second in two weeks — took the death toll to 6,430. There have been 841,184 infections since the pandemic began. Of the over 40,000 tests so far performed on Monday, 0.5% come back positive, up slightly from the 0.4% rate recorded over the past several days. To combat the rising infections, the Health Ministry reimposed the indoor mask mandate on Friday and the government has moved to tighten rules on travel, given concerns that the Delta variant was contributing to the recent surge. Meeting Sunday evening for the first time since the new government was sworn in, the coronavirus cabinet discussed increased testing and enforcement on Israel’s borders and a boosted effort to vaccinate teens — but did not add any major new restrictions.

News article:
The number of adolescent getting vaccinated against the coronavirus has risen sharply in recent days, raising hopes that a large portion of the country’s minors eligible for shots will be protected against COVID-19 in coming weeks. As of Tuesday morning, nearly 32 percent of Israelis in the 10-19 age bracket had received at least one dose of the vaccine, up from around 23% a week earlier, Health Ministry data showed. Authorities launched a renewed drive to vaccinate teens aged 12 to 15 last week, responding to mounting numbers of new cases, many of them attributed to the fast-spreading Delta variant of the virus. Since then, the number of shots distributed daily has climbed to back over 10,000 for the first time since early April. That’s when Israel’s world-leading vaccination drive stalled after distributing the vaccine to nearly 5 million people, the majority of its eligible population. On Monday, over 14,314 people received the first dose of the vaccine, up from 13,513 people who received the first dose a day earlier, according to Health Ministry data. Over 11,000 first doses were distributed by noon Tuesday. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The vast majority of those getting the shot in recent days fall into the 10-19 age category, according to official figures, which only go to Saturday. On June 24, 9,866 people in the age bracket received a first dose of the vaccine, representing over 83% of everyone getting the first shot that day. Similar percentages have been seen on other days as well. Among those getting vaccinated on Tuesday was Michal Bennett, the 14-year-old daughter of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. The premier tweeted a picture of his daughter and called on others to go get vaccinated. גם מיכל שלי התחסנה עכשיו. גאה בך מיכלי❤️ Advertisement ומה איתכם? קרדיט צילום: נמרוד גליקמן – דוברות כללית, מחוז שרון שומרון pic.twitter.com/io1SYXKLw5 — Naftali Bennett בנט (@naftalibennett) June 29, 2021 “The Delta disease can harm those who are not vaccinated, and that is the children,” Bennett said Tuesday while touring a youth vaccination center in Holon. He set a goal of 30,000 vaccines a day for the next 10 days. According to reports, Israel has 1.4 million doses set to expire at the end of next month and Bennett is hoping to use as many of them as possible by getting 300,000 children vaccinated by July 9, leaving enough time for a second dose from the expiring batch as well. Advertisement Three of Israel’s four major health funds say that around 50 percent of their members aged 12 to 15 will be protected from the virus by next month, adding together those who have been vaccinated, those who have scheduled vaccinations, and those who have recovered from the disease, Channel 12 news reported Tuesday. Israel okayed the vaccine for 12-to-15-year-olds in early June, but authorities only began encouraging vaccinations for the age group last week in response to rising case numbers. Israel in recent days has seen daily caseload levels climb to levels not seen since April. Nearly 300 cases were confirmed on Monday and another 287 were reported by Tuesday evening. The hospitalization rate has remained low, however, with only 22 people hospitalized in serious condition as of Tuesday, the ministry said. Many experts consider hospitalizations to be better than total case numbers for measuring an area’s health. “So long as there’s no serious morbidity, we can continue to live our lives as normally as possible,” Dr. Arnon Afek, head of Sheba-Tel Hashomer Medical Center near Tel Aviv told Army Radio Tuesday. Nonetheless, some officials have reportedly expressed fears that the number of seriously ill will rise, with Israel unprepared to deal with the influx. “The staff are tired, frustrated and still haven’t had a chance to recover. They simply won’t be able to handle it. It will be a catastrophe,” an unnamed health official was quoted telling the Ynet news website. The Delta variant of the virus, first identified in India, is more contagious than other variants and may be better able to bypass vaccines, but apparently does not cause serious infection. The transmissibility of the Delta variant over the original strain is around 40%, according to the United Kingdom’s Public Health agency. The effectiveness of two vaccine doses for protection from hospitalization is at 96%, according to the agency. Advertisement With case numbers rising, Israel has thus far reimposed an indoor mask mandate and cracked down on travelers arriving from countries with high infection rates or breaking quarantine, but has sought to avoid a return to the restrictions it has largely emerged from over the last two months. “We can beat the current coronavirus wave without restrictions,” Bennett said Tuesday. “Vaccinations instead of lockdowns, masks instead of restrictions.”

The number of adolescent getting vaccinated against the coronavirus has risen sharply in recent days, raising hopes that a large portion of the country’s minors eligible for shots will be protected against COVID-19 in coming weeks. As of Tuesday morning, nearly 32 percent of Israelis in the 10-19 age bracket had received at least one dose of the vaccine, up from around 23% a week earlier, Health Ministry data showed. Authorities launched a renewed drive to vaccinate teens aged 12 to 15 last week, responding to mounting numbers of new cases, many of them attributed to the fast-spreading Delta variant of the virus. Since then, the number of shots distributed daily has climbed to back over 10,000 for the first time since early April. That’s when Israel’s world-leading vaccination drive stalled after distributing the vaccine to nearly 5 million people, the majority of its eligible population. On Monday, over 14,314 people received the first dose of the vaccine, up from 13,513 people who received the first dose a day earlier, according to Health Ministry data. Over 11,000 first doses were distributed by noon Tuesday. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The vast majority of those getting the shot in recent days fall into the 10-19 age category, according to official figures, which only go to Saturday. On June 24, 9,866 people in the age bracket received a first dose of the vaccine, representing over 83% of everyone getting the first shot that day. Similar percentages have been seen on other days as well. Among those getting vaccinated on Tuesday was Michal Bennett, the 14-year-old daughter of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. The premier tweeted a picture of his daughter and called on others to go get vaccinated. גם מיכל שלי התחסנה עכשיו. גאה בך מיכלי❤️ Advertisement ומה איתכם? קרדיט צילום: נמרוד גליקמן – דוברות כללית, מחוז שרון שומרון pic.twitter.com/io1SYXKLw5 — Naftali Bennett בנט (@naftalibennett) June 29, 2021 “The Delta disease can harm those who are not vaccinated, and that is the children,” Bennett said Tuesday while touring a youth vaccination center in Holon. He set a goal of 30,000 vaccines a day for the next 10 days. According to reports, Israel has 1.4 million doses set to expire at the end of next month and Bennett is hoping to use as many of them as possible by getting 300,000 children vaccinated by July 9, leaving enough time for a second dose from the expiring batch as well. Advertisement Three of Israel’s four major health funds say that around 50 percent of their members aged 12 to 15 will be protected from the virus by next month, adding together those who have been vaccinated, those who have scheduled vaccinations, and those who have recovered from the disease, Channel 12 news reported Tuesday. Israel okayed the vaccine for 12-to-15-year-olds in early June, but authorities only began encouraging vaccinations for the age group last week in response to rising case numbers. Israel in recent days has seen daily caseload levels climb to levels not seen since April. Nearly 300 cases were confirmed on Monday and another 287 were reported by Tuesday evening. The hospitalization rate has remained low, however, with only 22 people hospitalized in serious condition as of Tuesday, the ministry said. Many experts consider hospitalizations to be better than total case numbers for measuring an area’s health. “So long as there’s no serious morbidity, we can continue to live our lives as normally as possible,” Dr. Arnon Afek, head of Sheba-Tel Hashomer Medical Center near Tel Aviv told Army Radio Tuesday. Nonetheless, some officials have reportedly expressed fears that the number of seriously ill will rise, with Israel unprepared to deal with the influx. “The staff are tired, frustrated and still haven’t had a chance to recover. They simply won’t be able to handle it. It will be a catastrophe,” an unnamed health official was quoted telling the Ynet news website. The Delta variant of the virus, first identified in India, is more contagious than other variants and may be better able to bypass vaccines, but apparently does not cause serious infection. The transmissibility of the Delta variant over the original strain is around 40%, according to the United Kingdom’s Public Health agency. The effectiveness of two vaccine doses for protection from hospitalization is at 96%, according to the agency.

Israel is holding negotiations with the United Kingdom to broker a COVID-19 vaccine swap deal, according to an Israeli television report Wednesday. Under the exchange, Israel, which currently has an excess of doses, would ship around 1 million of its Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that are due to expire on July 30 to the UK, Channel 12 news reported. In exchange, the Health Ministry would receive an equivalent number of vaccines that the UK is slated to receive from Pfizer in September. The network described the talks on the proposed deal as “advanced” and said the shipments could begin as soon as next week. Israel is said to have around 1.4 million doses set to expire at the end of next month. Israel is also reportedly seeking answers from Pfizer on whether it can use the vaccines it already has past their declared expiration date. But without a clear answer, the network said Israel was warning it will not offer the first COVID shot to Israelis after July 9, since there will not be unexpired vaccines for their second dose three weeks later. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Government officials have been encouraging Israelis — adolescents in particular — to get a first shot before the July 9 deadline so they can get their second dose before the expiration date. On Monday, Kan news reported that the Health Ministry would destroy at least 800,000 expiring coronavirus vaccine doses if no buyers are found for them in the next two weeks. The vaccine doses are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the broadcaster. Earlier this month, Israel attempted a similar vaccine deal with the Palestinian Authority, but it fell through after the PA backtracked from receiving soon-to-be-expired doses, claiming they were not up to snuff. The PA later said it would seek to renegotiate the deal. Advertisement Israel said the vaccines were fine and that it was using them itself as part of its drive to vaccinate children aged 12 to 15. The push to get young Israelis vaccinated comes as Israel deals with a renewed rise in coronavirus cases, with much of the jump linked to schools and the spread of the more contagious Delta variant from abroad. As of Wednesday evening, Health Ministry figures showed 5,587,320 people out of Israel’s population of some 9.3 million have gotten their first vaccine shot. Of those, 5,167,674 received their second dose. The ministry also reported 224 new cases since midnight, bringing the number of active infections to 1,882. The positivity rate on the close to 41,000 tests performed Wednesday was 0.5 percent, similar to the past few days. The number of serious cases, which have remained stable since daily cases began increasing again, ticked up slightly to 26. The death toll remained at 6,429, with only one fatality in over two weeks, indicating the success of Israel’s mass national vaccination campaign in protecting against serious morbidity and mortality.

Topic: Security Region: Asia Tags: ChinaIranXi JinpingDefenseForeign Policy Ahead of Xi’s visit to Tehran, Sino-Iranian military cooperation looks to expand. China is often regarded as one of the prime beneficiaries of the Iran nuclear deal, signed in July 2015 with the P5+1 countries. Under the deal, Iran will limit its uranium enrichment and make other changes to its nuclear program in exchange for the termination of sanctions. This potential opening could provide Chinese state-owned energy companies a chance to increase their involvement with Iran’s oil and natural gas industries, and Iran could become a more important export market for a range of Chinese products. Beijing may also assist Tehran in building infrastructure as part of the massive Eurasian development project known as “One Belt, One Road,” as well as offer financing through the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Many agreements are likely to be announced during Chinese president Xi Jinping’s inaugural visit to Iran, planned for late January. A more worrisome, but overlooked, aspect of China’s growing ties with Iran could occur in the arms sector. A bit of historical context is needed here. In the 1980s and early 1990s, China was a major supplier of advanced weapons to Iran in areas ranging from tanks and fighter jets to fast-attack patrol craft and anti-ship missiles. Beijing was driven not only by profit motivations, but also, it seems, by a strategic desire to strengthen Iran as a bulwark against excessive U.S. influence in the Middle East. Chinese arms sales to Iran gradually declined in the late 1990s and 2000s, due to pressure from the United States and the imposition of UN sanctions against Iran. Those sanctions initially prohibited involvement with Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile industries, and were later expanded to cover major conventional weapons, such as combat aircraft and warships. Iran was also increasingly seen as a ‘pariah state,’ a status symbolized by the UN embargo, which discouraged China from maintaining overly close security ties with Tehran. Consequently, China’s arms relationship with Iran has been left largely moribund in the past decade. The Iran nuclear deal could spawn a resurgence of Chinese arms exports to Iran by lifting UN sanctions and helping diminish Iran’s ‘pariah state’ status. China, and other states, would be allowed to export major conventional weapons to Iran in the next eight years with UN Security Council approval. After eight years, even those restrictions would be lifted, assuming Iran complies with the agreement. In addition, certain types of weapons could be sold to Iran without a waiver. For instance, Russia has argued that its sale of S-300 missile defenses to Iran are permissible because this system is not specifically prohibited under the nuclear deal. China could make a similar argument regarding small arms, short-range missiles and other systems. In the coming years, China might attempt to sell a wide variety of advanced arms to Iran. These could include J-10 fighters, the possible sale of which has been reported in Chinese media. Another system would be the Houbei-class high-speed missile boat, which China is also poised to sell to Pakistan. This would be a logical choice given the expanding navy-to-navy relationship between China and Iran. China might also transfer advanced cruise missiles and technical know-how, allowing Iran to improve its domestic cruise missile program. Other systems could include UAVs, space and counter-space weapons, missile defense components and electronic warfare systems. Sales of most of these items would likely require UN approval, which China might attempt to secure as a permanent member of the Security Council. The implications of enhanced Sino-Iranian arms cooperation for the United States and regional security could be significant. Provision of high-speed missile boats, anti-ship missiles, and other systems would allow Iran to strengthen its “anti-access/area-denial” (A2/AD) capabilities—referring to the ability to hold U.S. forces at bay in the event of a crisis. Indeed, China would be in an excellent position to assist Iran in enhancing its A2/AD capabilities since Beijing has been developing weapons of just this sort to counter U.S. intervention—notably in the context of a crisis in the Taiwan Strait. For instance, Iran could use Chinese-supplied arms to increase the threat to U.S. naval ships in the Strait of Hormuz, a strategically vital channel for Gulf state oil exports to world markets. Iran might also use these weapons to conduct additional provocative exercises explicitly targeting U.S. forces in the region. In February 2015, Iranian forces destroyed a mock U.S. aircraft carrier using high-speed boats, shoulder-launched rockets, and cruise missiles. In December, Iran test-fired a missile within 1500 yards of the U.S. carrier Harry S. Truman, which was transiting the Strait of Hormuz. Chinese support could lead to a continuation or expansion of such destabilizing activities. Chinese military assistance could also enable Iran to improve its long-range missile capabilities, which could endanger more distant U.S. military targets, such as U.S. facilities on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia. China has pledged to adhere to Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) guidelines limiting transfer of components and technologies that can be used in long-range ballistic and cruise missiles, but its compliance with its commitments has sometimes been problematic. Chinese arms exports to Iran could also pose proliferation concerns. For instance, as part of its effort to expand influence in the region, Iran could elect to re-export weapons to states such as Syria, where Tehran is militarily supporting the Assad regime. Iran may also transfer Chinese-made arms to terrorist groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as to Shi’a militias in Iraq. These groups could in turn use Iran-supplied arms to strike military and civilian targets. Of course, Chinese foreign ministry officials would likely push against a significant resumption of arms sales to Iran. Doing so would pose a challenge to China’s desire for positive relations with the United States. Major arms sales would also needlessly disrupt China’s relations with a variety of other states in the region that are on poor terms with Tehran, such as Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Turkey. Some Chinese firms may also be cautious about running afoul of U.S. sanctions, which will continue to target Iran on human rights and counter-terrorism grounds. However, the People’s Liberation Army and Chinese arms manufacturers may lobby in favor of renewed arms exports to Iran. As in the past, some Chinese military strategists could portray arms sales as a way to counter U.S. ‘hegemony’ in the Middle East and build a more multi-polar world order. For their part, Chinese arms traders could seek to retain their competitive advantage by exploiting an important new market. Ultimately, it would be up to China’s top leaders, including President Xi Jinping, to arbitrate between these different perspectives and decide whether and how to re-engage Iran in the arms sector. The United States can take steps to mitigate the risks of a resurgence of Sino-Iranian arms cooperation. Washington should work with Britain, France, and other partners in the UN Security Council to deny waivers for sales of major conventional weapons to Iran. Continuing U.S. sanctions on Iran should also be vigorously enforced, as should potential new sanctions on Iran’s ballistic missile program. U.S. officials should also press their Chinese counterparts to avoid selling the most advanced systems to Iran and to adhere strictly to MTCR limits on missile technology exports. The argument should be that greatly improved military capabilities could allow Tehran to conduct a more brazen and bellicose foreign policy. This would undermine China’s enduring need for stability in a region from which it continues to receive over half of its oil supply. Thus, Beijing’s restraint on arms sales would not only avoid tensions with Washington and many others, including Riyadh and Tel Aviv, but would also fundamentally support China’s own strategic interests.

(Recasts, adds details, context, changes slug) BEIJING, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping will make an unusual visit next week to Saudi Arabia and Iran, who are locked in a bitter dispute, in what could be a bid by Beijing to act as an “honest broker” as it seeks a greater regional diplomatic role. While relying on the region for oil supplies, China has tended to leave Middle Eastern diplomacy to the other four permanent members of the U.N. Security Council - the United States, Britain, France and Russia. But China has been trying to get more involved, especially in Syria, recently hosting both its foreign minister and opposition officials. In a brief statement, China’s Foreign Ministry said Xi would visit Saudi Arabia, Iran and Egypt on his Jan. 19-23 visit. It provided no other details. A Chinese president has not visited Saudi Arabia since 2009 when Hu Jintao went, and Jiang Zemin was the last Chinese president to visit Iran, going in 2002. Tensions between the Sunni Muslim kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Shi’ite Muslim Iran have escalated since Saudi authorities executed Shi’ite cleric Nimr al-Nimr on Jan. 2, triggering outrage among Shi’ites across the Middle East. In response, Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran and its consulate in Mashhad, prompting Riyadh to sever relations. Tehran then cut all commercial ties with Riyadh, and banned pilgrims from travelling to Mecca. Last week, a Chinese envoy visited Saudi Arabia and Iran, where he called for both countries to exercise calm and restraint amid their on-going feud. “China is trying to present itself as an honest broker between Saudi and Iran, much as it has done between the Syrian government and opposition,” said one Beijing-based diplomat, who is familiar with China’s Middle East policy. Li Shaoxian, vice president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, a government think-tank, said China had to step up to the plate in the Middle East, but stressed China’s role would be different from other superpowers. “The Middle East is a touchstone for major powers,” Li said. “Whether it is a graveyard depends on whether a country seeks hegemony,” Li said, adding that was not China’s intention. The Middle East, however, is fraught with risk for China, a country that has little experience navigating the religious and political tensions that frequently wrack the region. Diplomatic sources said the Iran and Saudi trips had originally been mooted for last year. But it was cancelled after a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Muslim allies began air strikes in Yemen against the Iran-allied Shi’ite Houthi movement, as China apparently did not want to be seen to be taking sides in the Yemen civil war. China also has its own worries about radicalisation of the Muslim Uighur people who live in China’s far western region of Xinjiang, which has been beset by violence in recent years, blamed by Beijing on Islamist militants. This week, China said it wanted to develop deeper defence and anti-terrorism ties with the Arab world, including joint exercises, intelligence sharing and training. China says some Uighurs have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight with militant groups there. In November, Islamic State said it had killed a Chinese citizen it had taken hostage in the Middle East.

China Gears Up to Play Bigger Role in Middle East Politics by Saibal Dasgupta January 14, 2016 Chinese President Xi Jinping's first official visit to the Middle East next week is a signal of Beijing's intention to be a major player in Mideast affairs, analysts say. The Chinese government has not yet announced specifics of Xi's Mideast tour. But official agencies in Iran and Egypt say he will visit the region beginning January 20. This would be the first time in 12 years a Chinese president will visit the two countries. Xi is also expected to visit Saudi Arabia. China, has been signaling its growing interest in dealing with thorny issues in the Middle East. Beijing issued its first ever policy paper on the Arab world on Wednesday, promising to support Arab governments in their fight against terrorism through long-term security cooperation, intelligence sharing and technical cooperation. In December it hosted Syrian Deputy Prime Minister Walid al-Moallem, and also representatives of the Syrian opposition. Beijing recently sent Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Ming to Saudi Arabia and Iran to help lower tension caused by the execution of a controversial Shi'ite cleric and the attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran. The recent moves sparked speculation that China might send its troops to Syria to fight alongside Russian soldiers. Analysts are asking why China wants to step into a diplomatic mine field that poses serious risks. "If you are able to make a difference in the Middle East, you will be regarded as a major country. China faces restrictions in the Middle East, but it is ready to play its role," said Li Shaoxian, vice president of Institute of Contemporary International Relations, a government-run think tank. But Li says, 'Unlike Russia, China has no need or aspirations for a military role. We can accept anything that is in line with the desires of local people in another country.' China is worried that disruptive events in the Middle East may impact the thinking in its vast Muslim population. It is possible that thousands of Chinese Muslims have migrated to fight for different forces in Syria, he said. Managing contradictions Analysts say there are signs Chinese leaders are determined to get a taste of managing disputes in the Middle East, which it has avoided for decades. One in particular is its effort to be friendly with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders. "China is trying to strike a delicate balance. It wants to support the Palestinian cause because this will earn it respect and sympathy in the Middle East. But it cannot turn its back on the useful technologies that Israel can supply," Daud Abdullah, director of the London-based Middle East Monitor told VOA. "We know, for instance, that Israel has been covertly supplying to China the arms know-how it acquired from the U.S." Most analysts believe China will tread carefully, because taking sides in the tumultuous Mideast can have negative repercussions in its own region of Xinjiang, which is a hotbed of Islamic terrorism. For example, it is careful not to take a stance that would displease Turkey because Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang are Turkic speaking people. "I think China is trying to find a political role for itself in the Middle East. It is difficult for China to stay neutral, but it is going to give it a try," Francesco Sisci, professor at the Renmin University in Beijing, said. Economic motives The Middle East is important because the region is one of the three routes chosen for China's Silk Road program, which is expected to boost the Chinese economy in a big way, Sisci said. "Beijing will try to be neutral with regard to tensions among Iran, Saudi Arabia and Syria. But they want China to take a more clear cut stance," Hichem Karoui, political adviser at the Diplomatic Institute at Qatar, said. Li cited three other reasons why China wants to play a major role in the Middle East. More than half of China's energy imports come from the region. It is an important aspect of the Silk Road program, which involves building infrastructure projects across several countries. And it is essential to play an important role in the Middle East to be taken seriously as a major power, he said. NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
(MENAFN- Daily News Egypt) China will continue to adopt a balanced approach to its engagement with the Middle East, according to Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Ming Monday. The announcement comes days before a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Iran and Saudi Arabia, a visit that is thought to signal a change in the Chinese government's policy in the region. Diplomatic tension between the region's two competing powers was ignited anew when Saudi Arabia executed prominent Shi'a cleric Nimr Al-Nimr. This was followed by attacks on Saudi diplomatic buildings in Iran by angry protestors. Saudi Arabia responded to the attacks on its diplomatic mission by severing all diplomatic ties with Iran. Zhang confirmed that China is a disinterested party in the conflict. "Regarding some of the region's problems, China has always taken a balanced and just position," he said. "The world won't be calm unless the Middle East is stable. No country can achieve development without being stable," Zhang continued. China depends on the Middle East to provide oil to its growing economy; however, it has never interfered with Middle Eastern politics, allowing other permanent UN Security Council members to address issues that have arisen. The Chinese vice foreign minister confirmed that his country will cooperate with Iran in energy production, after sanctions were lifted from the country last year. The official Chinese news agency, Xinhua, reported that China plans for Iran to be a part of the New Silk Road initiative to develop trade routes across Asia. "After the sanctions lift, Iran's economy can develop faster, but it needs the technological support to update its infrastructure," the report read. Iran experienced its first day without sanctions Sunday, after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed Iran's commitment to its deal with the West. Last week, Zhang Ming visited both Riyadh and Tehran and urged both countries to ease the hostilities. Zhang addressed possible methods to resolve the current tensions and repeated his message in Tehran, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry. In the past month, China hosted members from both the Syrian regime and the opposition to urge both sides to find a solution to the Syrian civil war. China is considered to be a safeguarding force of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad. It voted against UN resolutions aimed at addressing the Syrian crisis four times. China published its first official Arab policy paper, claiming to "support Arab countries" struggling to uphold sovereignty and territorial integrity, pursue and safeguard national interests, and combat external interference and aggression. Within this framework, it emphasised its support for the Arab league in its effort to establish an independent Palestinian state. The Chinese president will also visit Egypt during his trip to the Middle East. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi highlighted the importance of the Chinese president's visit to Cairo. In a meeting with Prime Minister Sherif Ismail and the ministers of trade, transportation and housing, President Al-Sisi discussed the projects to be established in cooperation with China. Conversation also addressed the manner in which Egypt can participate in China's New Silk Road initiative. Emanuele Scimia, a foreign affairs analyst at the South China Morning Post believes that China is trying to moderately change its non-interference policy in the Middle East and North Africa and shift to a more assertive engagement in the region. According to Scimia, soft-power diplomacy alone will not be enough for China to realise its aims. "The problem for Beijing is that diplomacy can hinge on trade and investment, but it must also be supported by military presence: something that China lacks at the moment," Scimia told the Daily News Egypt.

News article:
With relations between Beijing and Riyadh anchored by Saudi Arabia's extensive oil exports to China (totaling 1/6 of China's overall imports), it is Xi's visit to Tehran, scheduled for the end of his trip, which has analysts worried. This will be the first visit by a Chinese leader to Iran in nearly a decade and a half, and comes right on time for Beijing, the newspaper suggests. "The trip comes just days after the lifting of international sanctions on Iran under the Obama administration-backed nuclear accord that went into effect over the weekend, and analysts say Beijing is eager to get in on the ground floor as the Iranian government scrambles to end its diplomatic isolation and ink deals with foreign investors," The Washington Times writes. Furthermore, with tensions between Riyadh and Tehran on the rise, "some believe Mr. Xi's goal is to promote a message that both Riyadh and Tehran would be wise to embrace China – not Washington – as the partner of the future."

Chinese President Xi Jinping, the first head of state visiting Iran since sanctions were lifted on Tehran, is poised to sign letters of intent with the Islamic Republic for a new chapter in strategic economic cooperation. Xi, who arrived in Tehran on Friday night, was officially welcomed by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Saturday. The Chinese leader, who made great contribution to the signature of Iran’s landmark deal with world powers last July, hopes to further boost his country’s traditional friendship and economic engagement with Iran. China, a top oil consumer, has been a top buyer of Iran’s crude. Even after international sanctions targeted Tehran’s energy sector, China continued its cooperation with Iran by purchasing oil and developing energy projects. Upon arrival in Tehran, Xi said that Iran and China, whose friendship dates back to 2,000 years ago, have made important contribution to human progress. He said establishment of political relations between Iran and China has resulted in important achievements in the political, economic and cultural sectors. Iran and China signed 17 documents for cooperation in economic, industrial, cultural and judicial fields in the presence of the two countries’ presidents. The documents included one signed between Iranian and Chinese nuclear chiefs for peaceful energy cooperation. Others involved documents for environmental cooperation, financing of a bullet train railway and banking cooperation. The Chinese president’s trip to Tehran is the last leg of his three-nation tour which has also taken him to Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The value of trade transactions between Tehran and Beijing stood at some $52 billion in 2014. However, the figure dropped in 2015 due to decreasing oil prices. ‘New chapter’ Xi said, “In cooperation with the Iranian side and by benefiting from the current favorable conditions, China is ready to upgrade the level of bilateral relations and cooperation so that a new chapter will start in bilateral relations in the long term.” Iranian and Chinese presidents preside over a high-level meeting in Tehran on January 23, 2016. (president.ir) He noted that the two countries have been on the same wavelength with regard to regional and international affairs. During his visit, Xi is scheduled to hold talks with Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei. China remains Iran’s top trade partner. According to China’s Commerce Department, during the first 11 months of 2015, China imported 24.36 million tons of crude oil from Iran, or 8 percent of its total imports. China’s oil companies have also been increasing investment in oil projects overseas. The North Azadegan Oil Field, located along Iran-Iraq border, is one example of cooperation projects led by China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). Following the recent removal of sanctions, Iran is once again open to global business, which makes the market more competitive as many global companies are already moving to resume trade with Iran.

Rouhani said that the Islamic Republic welcomes stronger ties with China particularly after the recent lifting of international sanctions on Iran. He also said Iran and China have agreed on more cooperation to “combat regional terrorism.” He said he and his Chinese counterpart discussed cooperation for “creating stability and security in the Middle East and helping countries plagued by terrorism, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and providing intellectual and intelligence assistance in the fight on terrorism.” For his part, Xi said he has traveled to Iran to prepare the ground for a new “prospect in relations between the two countries." He noted that Iran-China strong cooperation will not only benefit the governments and nations of the two countries, but also would serve “regional and global peace.” Xi said he seeks “strategic ties with Iran”, particularly in energy market. China, a top oil consumer, has been a top buyer of Iran’s crude. Even after international sanctions targeted Tehran’s energy sector, China continued its cooperation with Iran by purchasing oil and developing energy projects. Iran and China signed 17 documents for cooperation in economic, industrial, cultural and judicial fields in the presence of the two countries’ presidents. The documents included one signed between Iranian and Chinese nuclear chiefs for peaceful energy cooperation. Others involved documents for environmental cooperation, financing of a bullet train railway and banking cooperation. The Chinese president’s trip to Tehran is the last leg of his three-nation tour which has also taken him to Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The value of trade transactions between Tehran and Beijing stood at some $52 billion in 2014. However, the figure dropped in 2015 due to decreasing oil prices. China remains Iran’s top trade partner. According to China’s Commerce Department, during the first 11 months of 2015, China imported 24.36 million tons of crude oil from Iran, or 8 percent of its total imports. China’s oil companies have also been increasing investment in oil projects overseas. Following the recent removal of sanctions, Iran is once again open to global business, which makes the market more competitive as many global companies are already moving to resume trade with Iran.

Xi Jinping's Charm Offensive: China Extends a Helping Hand to the Mideast Sputnik News 13:04 22.01.2016(updated 13:36 22.01.2016) Chinese President Xi Jinping is visiting Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Iran as part of a five-day trip, which has seen Beijing ink billion-dollar deals and boost ties in the Middle East at a time when Washington's presence in the oil-rich region is becoming less pronounced. Xi's tour is largely focused on economic and energy cooperation with the Arab world, the South China Morning Post noted. But 'it is also a mission to forge closer political, diplomatic and military ties with countries and to promote China's image and influence as a global power, resembling what the Middle Kingdom was 2,000 years ago,' the newspaper asserted. Xi's tour first brought him to Saudi Arabia, China's largest oil supplier, earlier this week. The Chinese president and King Salman agreed to foster energy cooperation between the two countries and oversaw the opening of a major Yanbu oil refinery, a joint Saudi Aramco and Sinopec venture. In addition, China announced that it plans to finalize 'a comprehensive free trade agreement' with the Gulf Cooperation Council later this year. The talks on the issue were launched in 2004, but the process was suspended in 2009. Xi later traveled to Egypt. China's state-run news agency Xinhua described the ties between the two countries as a 'comprehensive strategic partnership.' Incidentally, the same formula was applied with regard to China's relations with the oil kingdom and Iran. The two-day visit of the Chinese president to the North African nation produced more than 20 agreements covering civil aviation, electricity, higher education, science, media, banking and trade. The Chinese president also said that Beijing plans to invest as much as $15 billion in Egypt's economy as both countries agreed to promote cooperation under Xi's signature foreign policy initiative, known as the One Belt, One Road. Ahead of his visit to the Islamic Republic, Xi noted that Beijing wants 'to strengthen strategic cooperation with Iran.' He also announced plans to provide humanitarian aid to Syria, Libya, Yemen, Lebanon and Jordan amounting to almost $35 million in 2016. Xi's tour comes a week after Beijing unveiled its first official strategy towards the Middle East. Known as the Arab Policy Paper, the document called for greater political, economic, energy and security cooperation with the region. Relations between China and the Arab world, according to the brief, should be based on the One Belt, One Road development strategy. © Sputnik NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Saturday hailed a "new chapter" in relations with China after talks with President Xi Jinping, who is touring the region to boost Beijing's economic influence. The Asian giant and the Middle East's foremost Shiite power aim to build economic ties worth up to $600 billion within the next 10 years, Rouhani announced. The two leaders oversaw the signing of 17 agreements in areas including politics, the economy, security and cooperation on peaceful nuclear energy. "With the Chinese president's visit to Tehran and our agreements, a new chapter has begun in Tehran-Beijing relations," Rouhani said in a televised speech, flanked by Xi. It is the first visit to Iran by a Chinese president in 14 years, according to state news agency IRNA, and comes just days after sanctions against Tehran were lifted under a historic nuclear deal with world powers. "Iran is China's major partner in the Middle East and the two countries have chosen to boost bilateral relations," IRNA quoted Xi as saying. "China and Iran are two important developing countries that must continue regional and international cooperation," Xi added. Beijing has long taken a backseat to other diplomatic players in the Middle East but analysts say the region is crucial to Xi's signature foreign policy initiative -- known as "One Belt One Road" -- touted as a revival of ancient Silk Road trade routes. China, the world's second-largest economy, also relies heavily on energy imports from the Middle East. Beijing is Tehran's top customer for oil exports, which in recent years were hit by U.S. and EU sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program. Trade between the two countries was worth $52 billion in 2014. They did not give details of their goal of developing relations worth $600 billion over the next decade. According to Iranian media, more than a third of Iran's foreign trade is carried out with China. - 'Constructive role' -The two presidents issued a joint statement outlining a long-term "comprehensive strategic partnership". The two countries agreed to enhance cooperation including in fossil and renewable energy, transportation, railways, ports, industry, commerce and services, said the statement, published by Mehr news agency. China has committed to "invest and finance upstream and downstream energy projects in Iran," it said. China "acknowledges Iran's constructive role in the fight against terrorism and maintaining peace and stability in the region," it added, while supporting Tehran's increased role in regional and international affairs. China, along with the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia, was among the countries that reached the agreement with Iran in July to curtail its nuclear activities in exchange for ending international sanctions. Xi, accompanied by three deputy prime ministers and six ministers, also brought with him a large business delegation. He was scheduled to meet later Saturday with Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Xi's tour, his first of the Middle East as Chinese president, has also taken him to Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Riyadh and a number of Sunni Arab allies broke diplomatic ties with Iran this month after protesters angry over the execution of a prominent Shiite cleric ransacked Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran. In Cairo, Xi offered $55 billion in loans and investments to the Middle East, a region where China wants to strengthen its economic presence.

Sign 17 accords, including revival of old Silk Route; President Xi visits Tehran DUBAI: Iran and China agreed to expand bilateral ties and increase trade to $600 billion in the next 10 years, President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday during a visit to Tehran by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Xi is the second leader of a UN Security Council member to visit Tehran after the nuclear deal Iran struck with world powers last year. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Tehran in November. Iran emerged from years of economic isolation this month when the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog ruled it had curbed its nuclear programme, clearing the way for the lifting of UN, US, and European Union sanctions. “Iran and China have agreed to increase trade to $600 billion in the next 10 years,” Rouhani said at a news conference with Xi broadcast live on state television. “Iran and China have agreed on forming strategic relations (as) reflected in a 25-year comprehensive document,” he said. Iran and China signed 17 accords on Saturday, including on cooperation in nuclear energy and a revival of the ancient Silk Road trade route, known in China as One Belt, One Road. “China is still heavily dependent on Iran for its energy imports and Russia needs Iran in terms of its new security architecture vision for the Middle East,” said Ellie Geranmayeh, policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Iran plays quite an integral role for both China and Russia’s interests within the region, much more than it does for the Europeans,” Geranmayeh said. Xi was quoted as saying by China’s Xinhua news agency: “The China-Iran friendship...has stood the test of the vicissitudes of the international landscape. “The Chinese state-backed Global Times newspaper said in an editorial on Saturday that China hoped to improve ties with Iran as part of its sweeping plan to rebuild trade links with Europe and Asia and carve out new markets for its goods. “China is of course considering its self interest in strengthening cooperation with Iran, especially at a time when China is in the midst of expending efforts to push forward the One Belt, One Road initiative, Iran is an important fulcrum,” the paper said. Rouhani said the countries had also agreed to cooperate on “terrorism and extremism in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen”. Iran has called on China to join the fight against Daesh and play a more active role in the region.

By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin DUBAI (Reuters) — Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday called for closer economic and security ties with China, saying Iran had never trusted the West, as the two countries agreed to increase bilateral trade more than 10-fold to $600 billion in the next decade. Iran’s most powerful figure told Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit Iran wanted to expand ties with “more independent countries”, adding the United States was “not honest” in the fight against terrorism in the region. “Iranians never trusted the West… That’s why Tehran seeks cooperation with more independent countries (like China),” Khamenei said. “Iran is the most reliable country in the region for energy since its energy policies will never be affected by foreigners,” Khamenei was quoted by his official website as saying at a meeting with Xi. Xi is the second leader of a U.N. Security Council member to visit Tehran since the nuclear deal Iran struck with world powers last year. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Tehran in November. Iran emerged from years of economic isolation this month when the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog ruled it had curbed its nuclear program, clearing the way for the lifting of U.N., U.S., and European Union sanctions. “Iran and China have agreed to increase trade to $600 billion in the next 10 years,” President Hassan Rouhani said at a news conference with Xi broadcast live on state television. “Iran and China have agreed on forming strategic relations (as) reflected in a 25-year comprehensive document,” he said. Iran and China signed 17 accords on Saturday, including cooperation in nuclear energy and a revival of the ancient Silk Road trade route, known in China as One Belt, One Road. “China is still heavily dependent on Iran for its energy imports and Russia needs Iran in terms of its new security architecture vision for the Middle East,” said Ellie Geranmayeh, policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Iran plays quite an integral role for both China and Russia’s interests within the region, much more than it does for the Europeans,” Geranmayeh said. New Markets Khamenei said Iran would never forget Chinese cooperation’s during the sanctions. “The China-Iran friendship … has stood the test of the vicissitudes of the international landscape,” Xi was quoted as saying by China’s Xinhua news agency. The Chinese state-backed Global Times newspaper said in an editorial on Saturday that China hoped to improve ties with Iran as part of its sweeping plan to rebuild trade links with Europe and Asia and carve out new markets for its goods. “China is of course considering its self interest in strengthening cooperation with Iran, especially at a time when China is in the midst of expending efforts to push forward the One Belt, One Road initiative, Iran is an important fulcrum,” the paper said. While China seeks closer ties with Iran, earlier this week it signaled its support for Yemen’s government, which is fighting an Iran-allied militia, during Xi’s visit to Saudi Arabia, Iran’s rival for influence in the region. Iran has called on China to join the fight against the Islamic State militant group and play a more active role in the region. Tehran is widely credited with convincing Russia to start its military intervention in Syria and join the fight against Islamic State. “Although China and Russia backed U.N. sanctions against Iran on its nuclear program, they were also heavily pushing for special waivers to continue trading with Iran,” Geranmayeh said. “Iran had a relationship both politically and economically with China and Russia for the last ten years in ways that it hasn’t had with Europe. So it’s quite natural to see it opening up first to these countries.”

News article:
By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin DUBAI (Reuters) — Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday called for closer economic and security ties with China, saying Iran had never trusted the West, as the two countries agreed to increase bilateral trade more than 10-fold to $600 billion in the next decade. Iran’s most powerful figure told Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit Iran wanted to expand ties with “more independent countries”, adding the United States was “not honest” in the fight against terrorism in the region. “Iranians never trusted the West… That’s why Tehran seeks cooperation with more independent countries (like China),” Khamenei said. “Iran is the most reliable country in the region for energy since its energy policies will never be affected by foreigners,” Khamenei was quoted by his official website as saying at a meeting with Xi. Xi is the second leader of a U.N. Security Council member to visit Tehran since the nuclear deal Iran struck with world powers last year. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Tehran in November. Iran emerged from years of economic isolation this month when the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog ruled it had curbed its nuclear program, clearing the way for the lifting of U.N., U.S., and European Union sanctions. “Iran and China have agreed to increase trade to $600 billion in the next 10 years,” President Hassan Rouhani said at a news conference with Xi broadcast live on state television. “Iran and China have agreed on forming strategic relations (as) reflected in a 25-year comprehensive document,” he said. Iran and China signed 17 accords on Saturday, including cooperation in nuclear energy and a revival of the ancient Silk Road trade route, known in China as One Belt, One Road. “China is still heavily dependent on Iran for its energy imports and Russia needs Iran in terms of its new security architecture vision for the Middle East,” said Ellie Geranmayeh, policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Iran plays quite an integral role for both China and Russia’s interests within the region, much more than it does for the Europeans,” Geranmayeh said. New Markets Khamenei said Iran would never forget Chinese cooperation’s during the sanctions. “The China-Iran friendship … has stood the test of the vicissitudes of the international landscape,” Xi was quoted as saying by China’s Xinhua news agency. The Chinese state-backed Global Times newspaper said in an editorial on Saturday that China hoped to improve ties with Iran as part of its sweeping plan to rebuild trade links with Europe and Asia and carve out new markets for its goods. “China is of course considering its self interest in strengthening cooperation with Iran, especially at a time when China is in the midst of expending efforts to push forward the One Belt, One Road initiative, Iran is an important fulcrum,” the paper said. While China seeks closer ties with Iran, earlier this week it signaled its support for Yemen’s government, which is fighting an Iran-allied militia, during Xi’s visit to Saudi Arabia, Iran’s rival for influence in the region. Iran has called on China to join the fight against the Islamic State militant group and play a more active role in the region. Tehran is widely credited with convincing Russia to start its military intervention in Syria and join the fight against Islamic State. “Although China and Russia backed U.N. sanctions against Iran on its nuclear program, they were also heavily pushing for special waivers to continue trading with Iran,” Geranmayeh said. “Iran had a relationship both politically and economically with China and Russia for the last ten years in ways that it hasn’t had with Europe. So it’s quite natural to see it opening up first to these countries.”

With the lifting of economic sanctions against Iran already in place, Tehran and Beijing have started to revive bilateral trade and economic ties, the Chinese newspaper Renmin Ribao (People's Daily) reported. The newspaper quoted Hua Liming, former Chinese Ambassador to Iran, the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands, as saying that Sino-Iranian economic and trade ties, which have suffered severe setbacks over the past 30-plus years, are set to enter a new phase in the coming years. "As the sanctions have been lifted, Iran's oil exports are back on track," Hua said, adding that the Iranian economy is most likely to benefit not only from oil exports to China, but also from Chinese investment and technology.

Chinese president meets Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei People's Daily Online (Xinhua) 09:09, January 24, 2016 TEHRAN, Jan. 23 -- Chinese President Xi Jinping and Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei met here Saturday, pledging to beef up practical cooperation between the two countries and jointly safeguard security, peace and stability in the region and around the world. Noting that China and Iran enjoy a long history of friendly exchanges, Xi said China will always be a 'reliable cooperative partner' of Iran and stands ready to deepen bilateral cooperation on all fronts. China and Iran are 'natural partners' in implementing the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, the president said, calling on the two sides to boost cooperation in infrastructure, interconnectivity, production capacity and energy within the framework of the initiative for the benefit of the two peoples. Xi told Khamenei that China will unswervingly follow a peaceful development path and adhere to an independent foreign policy of peace. 'China is willing to maintain mutual support with Iran in regional and global affairs, and jointly safeguard peace, stability and development in the region and around the world,' he added. Khamenei expressed gratitude to China for its enduring support for Iran, and said that Tehran is willing to push the bilateral practical cooperation to a new high. Iran is an important country along the Belt and Road and stands ready to play a greater role in jointly pursuing the initiative with China, the supreme leader said. He said China is a very influential country in the world and Iran hopes to strengthen communication and coordination with China to jointly safeguard security, peace and stability in the region. Xi concluded on Saturday night his five-day, three-nation tour in the Middle East, which had previously taken him to Saudi Arabia and Egypt. It is Xi's first overseas visit this year and also his first trip to the region since becoming Chinese president in 2013. NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address
