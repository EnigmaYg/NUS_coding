Iran-Taliban talks: An effort to promote regional peace Iran Press TV Sun Jan 13, 2019 05:56PM Tehran has confirmed that it has been in talks with the Afghan Taliban in an effort to promote Afghan and regional peace. Analysts say the move would also prevent the region from turning into a hotbed for Takiri terrorist groups, especially Daesh, which has already gained a foothold in Afghanistan as well. Daesh terrorists, who have been militarily defeated in Iraq and Syria, have been increasingly active in Afghanistan, clashing with both the Kabul government and Taliban militants and alarming neighboring nations, including Iran. Daesh has established a foothold in eastern and northern Afghanistan. The terrorist group has mostly been populating the eastern province of Nangarhar, from where it has carried out high-profile, brutal attacks at major population centers across the country. Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei in a speech last year said that the United States had been relocating the terror group from the Middle East to the South Asian country in an attempt to justify its military presence in the region. In recent weeks, senior officials in Tehran have stressed that Iran has been holding talks with the Taliban with the knowledge of the Afghan government in order to prevent continued foreign presence in the region and restore peace to the violence-wracked country. Bahram Qassemi, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in a news conference last month that the talks were intended to set the parameters for negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government. He noted the Taliban "are in control of 50 percent of Afghanistan" and had sought the meetings with the Iranian government. The remarks came a day after Iranian diplomats held a meeting with a Taliban delegation in Tehran, on December 30. Abbas Araqchi, the Iranian deputy foreign minister for political affairs, headed the Iranian negotiating team. On January 5, Araqchi visited Kabul to brief senior Afghan officials, including President Ashraf Ghani, on Iran's talks with Taliban representatives. Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, during a December 26, 2018 visit to Kabul also said that Tehran was in talks with the Taliban "to help curb the security problems in Afghanistan." "The Afghan government has been informed of the communications and talks carried out with the Taliban, and this process will continue," Iran's top security official added. On November 28, addressing the Geneva Conference on Afghanistan, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also called on the international community to facilitate "inclusive" dialog between the Taliban and the Afghan government in a bid to restore peace to Afghanistan. In his speech, the top Iranian diplomat also warned against the continued presence of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan, which has failed to restore security to the country 17 years after the US invasion. "The presence of foreign forces has never brought stability in our region and has historically provided a recruiting ground for extremists." Iran's foreign minister also said that the Daesh emergence had radicalized local armed groups in a competition over followers and recruits. "A new challenge is the introduction of Daesh to Afghanistan, which has led to more bloodshed and introduced dangerous sectarian tendencies." "Believe me, as no one gained from introducing and supporting Daesh and other extremists in Syria and Iraq, no one will gain from introducing them to Afghanistan and Central Asia. This horrific trend needs to be arrested before it reaches catastrophic proportions," he noted. Appreciating Iranian peace efforts, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai said in an interview with ISNA news agency on January 10 that the Iran-Taliban talks were beneficial to Afghanistan. "Iran is in contact with the Taliban, which is definitely beneficial to Afghanistan," he said. The US Department of Defense also in a recent report sent to Congress acknowledged Iran's key role in restoring peace and stability to war-torn Afghanistan, backtracking on Washington's earlier claims that Tehran supports the local Taliban militant group. "Iran seeks a stable Afghan government that is responsive to Iranian goals, the elimination of ISIS-K, the removal of the US/NATO presence, and the protection of Iranian concerns, such as water rights and border security." The developments come as Kabul government has stepped up efforts to convince the Taliban to end the 17-year militancy amid Washington's failures on the battleground. The Taliban's five-year rule over at least three quarters of Afghanistan came to an end with a US-led invasion in 2001; but 17 years on, the militant group continues to be active on much of Afghan soil. The Taliban have strengthened their grip over the past three years, with the government in Kabul controlling just 56 percent of the country, down from 72 percent in 2015, a recent US government report showed. President Ghani disclosed in November last year that nearly 29,000 soldiers and police personnel had been killed in battles against Taliban and other militant groups since 2015. Afghan Defense and Interior Ministry chiefs informed the national parliament in October 2018 that around 40 military and police personnel were being killed every day in Taliban attacks. The US, too, has been holding talks with the Taliban. US State Department's special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has said he had held "productive" meetings in Abu Dhabi with Afghan and international partners "to promote intra-Afghan dialogue towards ending the conflict." Khalilzad said the Taliban seek an agreement on the withdrawal of foreign forces, while the US wants assurances from the militant group that its forces would not be attacked. The talks are the latest in a flurry of diplomatic efforts aimed at putting an end to the war in Afghanistan, which began with the US-led invasion 17 years ago. The United States led a coalition in invading Afghanistan in October 2001 after the September 11 attacks. US forces have remained bogged down there through the presidencies of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and now Donald Trump. Trump has ordered the start of withdrawing some 7,000 troops from Afghanistan, about half of the total number of American boots on the ground in the war-torn country. Taliban militants have pledged to step up their attacks unless US forces fully withdraw from Afghanistan. NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

Why is Afghanistan concerned about Iran’s talks with Taliban? Iranian Diplomacy – An expert of Afghan affairs believes: “Prior to Iran’s talks with the Taliban, the government of Afghanistan had embarked on Afghan-to-Afghan talks with the Taliban. However, Kabul’s harsh position against Tehran has been taken from an angle of inactiveness on their part as a reaction to Iran’s initiative.” Afghanistan’s deputy foreign minister made the remarks while commenting on the latest statements by the Iranian foreign minister on Taliban’s role in the future of Afghanistan, accusing Iran of clear interference in Afghanistan’s internal affairs, saying: “In our establishment, the proposal of merging armed groups is against Afghanistan’s diplomacy.” Moreover, the spokesperson for Afghanistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has claimed earlier that Iran is afraid of a democratic Afghanistan which enjoys freedom of speech and civil rights, while the Iranian authorities have stressed that Iran’s negotiations with the Taliban have taken place with the knowledge of Afghanistan’s government in line with preparations for Afghan peace talks. Professor Nozar Shafiei said: “It’s good to know why Iran is sensitive about the developments in Afghanistan and sometimes gets drawn into them. The reason is the direct impact of events in Afghanistan on Iran’s national security.” He added: “Afghanistan’s government is a failed state unable to provide security within its own borders; this insecurity and instability will also spread to Iran. Therefore, not only Iran, but also other countries will inevitably interact with Afghanistan’s domestic groups in order to prevent the expansion of such crisis into their own territories.” Shafiei, a former Iranian MP, added: “However, the participation of Taliban in the power structure of Afghanistan will completely depend on the government of Afghanistan. While the Taliban phenomenon is a reality in Afghanistan, excluding this group from the political scene of Afghanistan is not a promising perspective. Consequently, it is likely that they will eventually be part of the internal politics of Afghanistan. However, if this does not happen, we will witness continued insecurity in Afghanistan together with consistent threats against Iran’s national security.” Source: Persia Digest

News article:
US, Taliban May Have Reached Accord on Troop Exit, VOA Told By Ayaz Gul January 26, 2019 The United States and the Taliban may have agreed on a plan for American troops to leave Afghanistan, sources privy to the development told VOA Saturday. In return, the insurgent group has given assurances that no international terrorist groups would be allowed to use Afghan soil to threaten America or any other country in the future. The understanding is the outcome of nearly a week of intense, uninterrupted dialogue between U.S. and insurgent representatives in Doha, Qatar. Representatives of the host government and Pakistan also have been in attendance. The sources told VOA they expected the two negotiating sides to announce the withdrawal plan by Monday at the latest, if all goes as planned. The U.S. drawdown plan would require the Taliban to observe a cease-fire. Both the withdrawal and the cease-fire, however, will be "limited and conditional." Sources did not rule out the possibility that President Donald Trump might announce and give details of the final agreement with the Taliban at his State of the Union speech, whenever that is scheduled. The U.S. special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, has been leading the American side in what observers describe as an unprecedented engagement between the two adversaries in the 17-year-old war. Still work to do Khalilzad tweeted late Saturday that after six days in Doha, he was headed to Afghanistan for consultations. "We have a number of issues left to work out. Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and 'everything' must include an intra-Afghan dialogue and comprehensive cease-fire," he said. Khalilzad described his meetings in Doha as "more productive than they have been in the past" and added that the two sides had made "significant progress on vital issues." He did not elaborate and said the talks would resume shortly. Late Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a tweet, "Encouraging news from @US4AfghanPeace (Khalilzad). He reports significant progress in talks with the Taliban on #Afghanistan reconciliation." He added later, "The U.S. is serious about pursuing peace, preventing #Afghanistan from continuing to be a space for international terrorism & bringing forces home. Working with the Afghan gov't & all interested parties, the U.S. seeks to strengthen Afghan sovereignty, independence & prosperity." Shortly after Khalilzad's tweets, the Taliban issued their own statement, saying the negotiations "revolving around the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and other vital issues saw progress." "The policy of the Islamic Emirate [the Taliban] during talks was very clear – until the issue of withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan is agreed upon, progress in other issues is impossible," the group noted. But the issues under consideration are of "critical nature and needed comprehensive discussions," the group said. The Taliban added that the two sides would share details of the Doha meetings and receive guidance from their "respective leaderships" before they reconvened to discuss "unsolved" matters to find an "appropriate and effective solution." The Taliban statement did not explain further. Sources told VOA they believed the agreement on a conditional and limited withdrawal and cease-fire would give both sides an opportunity to test the waters "without taking too huge a political risk." Pakistan takes credit Officials in Pakistan took full credit for persuading the Taliban to engage in the dialogue at the U.S. request. "Pakistan's success is that it has sincerely and faithfully diverted the recent positive environment and energy in its relations with the U.S. to the complete benefit of the Afghan peace process, and Afghanistan as a whole," a senior official told VOA as the talks progressed in Doha. Islamabad insists a peaceful Afghanistan is key to Pakistan's future security and economic stability as well as those of the region in general. Pakistani officials believe any agreement at this stage will help bridge the trust gap between the U.S. and the Taliban and will "add much needed political capital" to Washington's account to achieve the ultimate goal of peace in Afghanistan. This agreement may prove an important asset in later, more serious stages of negotiations, they said. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan's nascent government, which has made resolution of the Afghan conflict its top foreign policy priority, sees continued U.S. involvement in Afghanistan reconstruction as key to the future security and economic stability of the region. "This political reconciliation must succeed. ... We wish that the U.S. leaves Afghanistan as friend of the region, not as a failure," Pakistan army spokesman Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor stated prior to the Doha talks. Afghan president's outburst It is not clear whether the Taliban have agreed to talk directly with President Ashraf Ghani's national unity government in Afghanistan, an administration that critics say remains fragile, is marred with political controversies and suffers from "disunity." The Taliban have so far refused to engage with the Afghan government in a peace process, dismissing it as an illegitimate entity and an "American puppet." Speaking during the World Economic Forum this week in Davos, Ghani for the first time publicly criticized the Khalilzad-led peace effort and indicated the Afghan government might not accept any possible outcome of the Doha talks. Ghani warned that any truce the U.S. signs with the Taliban must pave the way for direct talks between his government and the insurgents to decide all issues, including foreign troop withdrawal. "There's discussion, but this discussion needs to be shared back. A discussion that does not involve the region, we will not trust," Ghani said when asked whether the talks in Qatar were nearing a breakthrough. "If we don't get all the pieces right, one piece alone doesn't suffice," he added. During his interaction, Ghani also revealed that since he took office in late 2014, Afghan security forces have lost more than 45,000 personnel while battling the Taliban. The United Nations continues to document record levels of civilian casualties in its annual reports. Millions of others have been made refugees within Afghanistan, and the warfare discourages many more from returning from refugee camps in Pakistan and Iran. Aside from the humanitarian consequences of the fighting, it has cost the United States nearly $1 trillion while its military has lost nearly 2,500 personnel. The presence of 14,000 American soldiers means Washington will continue to pay around $45 billion annually to sustain operations if peace talks fail to produce desired results. An American university research report released late last year noted that the Afghan war had killed about 150,000 people, including government forces, insurgents, U.S. and personnel of the NATO-led coalition. The U.S.-led military invasion stemmed from terrorist attacks on American cities in September 2001 that were plotted by al-Qaida, allegedly out of its bases in Afghanistan.

US, Taliban May Have Reached Accord on Troop Exit, VOA Told By Ayaz Gul January 26, 2019 The United States and the Taliban may have agreed on a plan for American troops to leave Afghanistan, sources privy to the development told VOA Saturday. In return, the insurgent group has given assurances that no international terrorist groups would be allowed to use Afghan soil to threaten America or any other country in the future. The understanding is the outcome of nearly a week of intense, uninterrupted dialogue between U.S. and insurgent representatives in Doha, Qatar. Representatives of the host government and Pakistan also have been in attendance. The sources told VOA they expected the two negotiating sides to announce the withdrawal plan by Monday at the latest, if all goes as planned. The U.S. drawdown plan would require the Taliban to observe a cease-fire. Both the withdrawal and the cease-fire, however, will be "limited and conditional." Sources did not rule out the possibility that President Donald Trump might announce and give details of the final agreement with the Taliban at his State of the Union speech, whenever that is scheduled. The U.S. special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, has been leading the American side in what observers describe as an unprecedented engagement between the two adversaries in the 17-year-old war. Still work to do Khalilzad tweeted late Saturday that after six days in Doha, he was headed to Afghanistan for consultations. "We have a number of issues left to work out. Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and 'everything' must include an intra-Afghan dialogue and comprehensive cease-fire," he said. Khalilzad described his meetings in Doha as "more productive than they have been in the past" and added that the two sides had made "significant progress on vital issues." He did not elaborate and said the talks would resume shortly. Late Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a tweet, "Encouraging news from @US4AfghanPeace (Khalilzad). He reports significant progress in talks with the Taliban on #Afghanistan reconciliation." He added later, "The U.S. is serious about pursuing peace, preventing #Afghanistan from continuing to be a space for international terrorism & bringing forces home. Working with the Afghan gov't & all interested parties, the U.S. seeks to strengthen Afghan sovereignty, independence & prosperity." Shortly after Khalilzad's tweets, the Taliban issued their own statement, saying the negotiations "revolving around the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and other vital issues saw progress." "The policy of the Islamic Emirate [the Taliban] during talks was very clear – until the issue of withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan is agreed upon, progress in other issues is impossible," the group noted. But the issues under consideration are of "critical nature and needed comprehensive discussions," the group said. The Taliban added that the two sides would share details of the Doha meetings and receive guidance from their "respective leaderships" before they reconvened to discuss "unsolved" matters to find an "appropriate and effective solution." The Taliban statement did not explain further. Sources told VOA they believed the agreement on a conditional and limited withdrawal and cease-fire would give both sides an opportunity to test the waters "without taking too huge a political risk." Pakistan takes credit Officials in Pakistan took full credit for persuading the Taliban to engage in the dialogue at the U.S. request. "Pakistan's success is that it has sincerely and faithfully diverted the recent positive environment and energy in its relations with the U.S. to the complete benefit of the Afghan peace process, and Afghanistan as a whole," a senior official told VOA as the talks progressed in Doha. Islamabad insists a peaceful Afghanistan is key to Pakistan's future security and economic stability as well as those of the region in general. Pakistani officials believe any agreement at this stage will help bridge the trust gap between the U.S. and the Taliban and will "add much needed political capital" to Washington's account to achieve the ultimate goal of peace in Afghanistan. This agreement may prove an important asset in later, more serious stages of negotiations, they said. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan's nascent government, which has made resolution of the Afghan conflict its top foreign policy priority, sees continued U.S. involvement in Afghanistan reconstruction as key to the future security and economic stability of the region. "This political reconciliation must succeed. ... We wish that the U.S. leaves Afghanistan as friend of the region, not as a failure," Pakistan army spokesman Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor stated prior to the Doha talks.

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, Feb. 7 By Azer Ahmadbayli – Trend: The Americans seem to have realized that it is impossible either to exterminate the Taliban movement or to cripple it for long, so they finally decided to make a deal with the movement. However, the fact that the US may come to an agreement with Taliban - may turn to be bad news for Iran. A few days ago, the enemy of Iran – the United States, and Iranian malevolent – the Taliban, who fought for many years for control over the territory of Afghanistan, reached a preliminary agreement on a ceasefire, reconciliation and withdrawal of American troops from the country. The United States, with its 14,000-strong military contingent and especially Air Force bases in Afghanistan, poses a serious threat to Iran from its eastern border. It is quite understandable that Iran gets nervous when seeing Americans close to its borders. Therefore, the ousting of the US from Afghanistan has always been on the Iranian agenda and in this respect the interests of Iran and the Taliban coincide. Throughout the relationship between Iran and the Taliban on the problem of common enemy, both sides have demonstrated a pragmatic approach useful for their own interests. But, since the Americans are in no hurry to leave Afghanistan, it was important for Iran to at least maintain a high degree of tension between the US troops and the Taliban. To this end, Iran, as many sources say, encapsulatedly supplied the Taliban with weapons and money when it was necessary to maintain the status quo of the existing chaos, or if you prefer, a balance of forces in Afghanistan. In turn, despite the non-recognition of Iran as a truly Islamic state and treating with contempt for the Iranian "Shiite heretics", the Taliban, nevertheless, did not shun receiving Iranian assistance. In general, however, relations between Iran and the Taliban today are more hostile than constructive. Both sides have bills for each other to be paid. Despite the fact that, as many experts, who are well aware of the situation in Afghanistan, say, the withdrawal of US troops, if it takes place, is likely to last for several years, it would seem that this is a good news for Tehran. However, insuperability of religious antagonism between the Shiite theocracy of Iran and the Sunni fundamentalism of the Taliban still prevails over unofficial tactical ties between the parties, and by organizing a couple of dirty provocations, it won’t be hard to start the sectarian war. The agreement concluded in Doha also envisages that Taliban will suppress activities of the Islamic State troops against the United States and its allies. But not against its foes. But if, despite all the unpredictability and outright cruelty of the Taliban, Iran hypothetically can still find a common language with them, then it will have to wage a war to the death with the IS jihadists, if attacked. Syria and Iraq, anyone? In January, Iranian Tasnim news agency reported that the United States organized the escape of forty IS leaders from the Taliban prison in North-West Afghanistan. In late January, Deputy Minister of internal Affairs of Russia Igor Zubov said that unknown helicopters are moving IS militants en masse to the Afghan-Tajik border. Earlier, last autumn, Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev warned that the "Islamic state" could repeat the Syrian scenario in Afghanistan. And on Tuesday, major-general Yahya Rahim Safavi, a top military adviser to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said that Iran has “precise information” that the US is transferring IS militants to Afghanistan, Iranian media outlets reported. “With the plots of Americans, Zionists and some Arab states, more than 100,000 ISIS insurgents invaded the Syrian and Iraqi nations and they intended to come for Iran after Syria and Iraq to claim caliphate in Khorasan, they had even determined an Amir for it. It was US, Israel and UK that established ISIS’ intelligence services. Now we have accurate information showing that US transfers ISIS’ terrorists to Afghanistan,” General Safavi said. Accumulation of the IS fighters in the neighboring country along with the financial support by Saudi billions can become a destructive factor for Iran's security. Iran should be on alert: the tactics used by Iranian proxies in the Middle East can be specularly applied against it from Afghanistan. So, what is better for Tehran – to coexist with the US troops deployed in Afghanistan or, probably, to stay face-to-face with IS (and maybe with Taliban) fighters – is a big question.

News article:
Happy Friday and welcome to Overnight Defense. We’re Rebecca Kheel and Ellen Mitchell, and here’s your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. CLICK HERE to subscribe to the newsletter. THE TOPLINE: The U.S. envoy negotiating peace the Taliban on Friday set a timeline for when the United States wants an agreement reached. Zalmay Khalilzad, U.S envoy for Afghanistan reconciliation, said he hopes to finish before the Afghan elections on July 20. Even if that doesn’t happen, though, he insisted Afghanistan’s elections will move forward. “It would be better for Afghanistan if we could get a peace agreement before the election,” Khalilzad said Friday at the U.S. Institute for Peace in his first public address since his appointment to the position. “If there is no progress on the peace track, elections will take place, and we are doing what we can to support the preparations for credible elections.” Khalilzad acknowledged the difficult timeframe but expressed hope negotiations can at least make significant progress by then. “I understand that peace processes are not a straight line. There could be setbacks,” he said. “Between now and July, there is sufficient time, I believe, where we could reach an agreement. But at least if we have significant progress, that will have a good impact with regard to the future and including the elections.” On a withdrawal: Khalilzad also stressed that, at the direction of President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the agreement he is seeking is not a “withdrawal agreement.” He added that the U.S. presence and possible withdrawal is “conditions based.” “A peace agreement can allow withdrawal, but it is not just a withdrawal agreement that we are seeking,” he said. While terrorism and the U.S. military withdrawal have been at the top of negotiations so far, the United States has a “long agenda” that needs to be addressed with the Taliban. Those include getting the Taliban to agree to a permanent ceasefire and to engage in direct negotiations with the Afghan government. “As I’ve said publicly in my tweets before, nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to,” Khalilzad stressed. On women’s rights: Khalilzad said Taliban-Afghan government negotiations is the place where issues such a women’s rights have to be address. Women in Afghanistan are fearful of a backslide in their rights if the Taliban becomes part of the government. “We will speak loudly and clearly for the values that we have, the values of human rights, the value of freedom of the press, women’s rights, all that we stand for, and we’ll make sure that they understand that for having positive relations in the future with the United States those values must be respected,” he said. “I know that the Afghanistan of today is very different than the Afghanistan of 19 years ago,” he added. “It’s a different country. And it will take time perhaps for the Taliban to appreciate that, but the message that they have given me is that they understand they cannot go back.” Addressing critics who say the Trump administration had abandoned the long-held U.S. position that peace talks have to be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned, Khalilzad said he sees himself as a “catalyst” to get to the point where the talks do meet that criteria. On a ceasefire: Khalilzad said the Taliban is reluctant to agree to a permanent ceasefire because it believes it will lose its leverage to get concessions from the Afghan government. He also said those representatives he was negotiating with in Qatar were not authorized to engage on that issue. Given that all sides in the war have expressed support for a peace process, he said, “then why should the killing go on?” MEANWHILE IN SYRIA: There was also news on Friday about the other pending U.S. military withdrawal. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration plans to withdraw U.S. forces in Syria by the end of April, with most of them out of the country by mid-March. Why it’s surprising: As recently as Tuesday, the top. U.S. general overseeing the military in the Middle East denied that there was a timeline for the withdrawal. “I am not under pressure to be out by a specific date, and I have not had any specific conditions put upon me,” U.S. Central Command commander Gen. Joseph Votel told the Senate Armed Services Committee. Of course, that was the same hearing where Votel revealed that Trump did not consult him prior to announcing the withdrawal in the first place in December. The Wall Street Journal also noted that there are still no plans to protect Kurdish partners against Turkey after the withdrawal, which has been a key concern of U.S. military officers and lawmakers. ON TAP FOR MONDAY Frank Kendall, the former head of Pentagon acquisition, will speak on concentration, competition and defense contracting outcomes at 3 p.m. at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. https://bit.ly/2BsTjzZ ICYMI — The Hill: House Democrats open investigation of Trump associates’ influence at VA — The Hill: Trump imposes travel ban on high-ranking Venezuelan officials — The Hill: Pakistan playing central role in US-Taliban peace talks: report — The Hill: Iran supreme leader: ‘Death to America’ aimed at leaders, not citizens — CNN: White House refuses to meet Congress’ deadline on Khashoggi killing — Defense One: The US military is chopping up its Iron Man suit for parts — Military Times: Like Trump, troops say we should watch Iran — but maybe not by increasing our forces in Iraq

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print By Amir Taghati In an interview with state run official news agency on January 5th, the Iranian regime’s foreign ministry’s spokesperson, Bahram Qassemi discussed the European Special Purpose Vehicle. “At the beginning, the European Union had good intentions and a positive political will about creating the financial mechanism, but gradually and during the negotiations over the past few months, this feeling became more serious that the European countries face some serious disabilities in implementing the SPV,” he said. His remarks have drawn criticism from the faction affiliated with Ali Khamenei. For example, an Iranian newspaper allied with the Supreme Leader, Vatan-e Emrouz, wrote, “[Bahram Qassemi] considered U.S. dollar’s hegemony and the ties between European and American economies among the major reasons why the SPV implementation is delayed and added: ‘The European Union and even the three European countries that are part of the JCPOA with Iran, are prisoners and hostages to the U.S. economy. Therefore, they have to make a decision for their independence and the continuation of their independent existence.” Vatan-e Emrouz also published the article, “2019/2020 budget gamble with SPV?!”, that challenged Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s budget on its 1.5-million-barrel-per-day oil-export estimation. The article explains that this estimate relies on the SPV and European imports of Iranian oil, but European support isn’t guaranteed. Regime’s MP Nasrollah Pejmanfar, told Vatan-e Emrouz newspaper, “The important issue is that the government can’t rely on the SPV at all for selling 1.5 million barrels of oil as it’s evident in the 2019/2020 budget bill. Because neither the solution is clear nor there is transparency about it.” Pejmanfar also said that oil is currently being sold “seven to ten dollars” below market price. As well, Sharq newspaper published an article on January 7th, entitled, “What should be done with the JCPOA?” It disparaged the SPV efforts, saying, “It’s likely that Europe will soon somehow create its promised financial mechanism, although it will be completely symbolic, useless, and ineffective,” and added, “This inefficiency is mostly rooted in Europe’s weak economy compared to the U.S. and also the legal structures of European markets, and not a desire by European governments to break their commitments.” After the U.S. exit from the JCPOA was announced in May 2018, Javad Zarif went to Brussels to seek help and support from the EU. Despite promises, nothing concrete has materialized. Zarif’s political deputy, Abbas Araghchi, has said, “We face a situation where Europeans either don’t want or can’t implement the financial mechanism. In some circles, it is said that the differences between Europe and the U.S. are just a game and they don’t have differences in reality. And we can’t dismiss this line of reasoning easily and we must consider it alongside other possibilities.” “You can say that this issue [FATF] has become sort of an excuse for the Europeans to delay the financial mechanism. If we want to do any amendments to this [FATF bills] and tell them that, it’s better to do it as soon as possible, so that they don’t have this excuse anymore and we can put more pressure on them to implement the mechanism,” states Abdolreza Faraji, the president of the Strategic Council for Iran’s Foreign Affairs. According to sources, the EU conditioned implementation of the SPV to Iran’s compliance with the world’s money laundering body, FATF. But, passing the four related bills necessary to do that has become one of the most controversial topics in Iran over the last several months. The laws that the Iranian regime must pass to bring it in line with international anti-money laundering and terrorism financing standards, will prevent it from supporting its many proxies in the region and around the world. This is unacceptable to the Islamic Republic.

News article:
Brussels/Paris - In Tehran on January 8 during a meeting with European envoys, Iranian officials abruptly stood up, walked out and slammed the door in an extraordinary break with protocol. The French, British, German, Danish, Dutch, and Belgian diplomats in the Iranian foreign ministry room had incensed the officials with a message that Europe could no longer tolerate ballistic missile tests in Iran and assassination plots on European soil, according to four EU diplomats. “There was a lot of drama, they didn’t like it, but we felt we had to convey our serious concerns,” one of the diplomats said. “It shows the relationship is becoming more tense,” a second said. An Iranian official declined to comment on the meeting. The next day, the European Union imposed its first sanctions on Iran since world powers agreed the 2015 Vienna nuclear arms control deal with Tehran. The sanctions were largely symbolic but the stormy meeting encapsulated the unexpected shift in European diplomacy since the end of last year. Smaller, more dovish EU countries have joined France and Britain in a harder stance on Tehran, including considering new economic sanctions, diplomats say. Those could include asset freezes and travel bans on Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and Iranians developing the Islamic Republic’s ballistic missile programme, three diplomats said. The new approach moves Europe closer to US President Donald Trump’s policy of isolating Iran with tough sanctions even though European governments still support the 2015 Vienna deal from which he withdrew in May. Although there are diverging views in Europe, the shift could have consequences for President Hassan Rouhani’s government as it looks to European capitals to salvage that deal. It could also strengthen anti-Western sentiment in Iran and lead to more aggressive Iranian moves around the Middle East, where the Islamic Republic is involved in proxy wars with its main regional rival Saudi Arabia. Iran’s firing of short-range ballistic missiles into Syria on September 30, missile tests and a satellite launch this month have niggled Western powers. For Europe, alleged assassination plots by Iran on French and Danish soil in 2018 were the last straw, diplomats say. Tehran denies the plots and says the missile tests are purely defensive. “The accusations against Iran over the past few months have awoken a few countries in Europe that were against a tougher line on Iran,” a European-based Middle East diplomat said. The same day as the meeting, the Netherlands publicly blamed Iran for killings on its soil in 2015 and 2017. Tehran denies any involvement. Then on January 9, the EU designated a unit of Iran’s intelligence ministry a terrorist organisation, froze its assets and those of two men. “Take the Dutch for example. They had kept very quiet until the Danish attack and now they are more hawkish than the French,” said the diplomat. Alarmed by Trump’s “America First” policy, Europe considered his May 8 decision to pull out of the Iran accord a severe setback but Iran’s international ambitions appear to offer Brussels and Washington a chance to work more closely. A US State Department official said there was now “a growing international consensus” on the range of Iranian threats. “The US welcomes Europe’s efforts to counter Iranian terrorism on European soil, its missile launches, human rights abuses, and other threats,” the official said. As the Trump administration accused Iran last year of harbouring nuclear ambitions and fomenting instability in the Middle East through its support for militant groups in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen, the EU sought dialogue with Tehran. At meetings between European and Iranian diplomats last year, Britain, France, Germany and Italy, pressed for gestures on Iran’s role in Syria’s war and for help to end the conflict in Yemen. But multiple bilateral talks on the ballistic missile programme have yielded no results. The EU tried to show Iran that compliance with the nuclear accord would still mean economic benefits despite Trump’s decision to reimpose US sanctions and choke off Iranian oil exports by pressuring US allies. The European Union is set to officially launch a mechanism, the special purpose vehicle (SPV) to trade with Iran later this month but it will not be operational for several months. It will be registered in France, run by a German and likely to include Britain as a shareholder. “There’s a feeling of frustration among Britain, France and Germany, and others, after the first phase of diplomacy with Iran,” another senior EU diplomat said. “We thought we could get some effort from the Iranians in several areas.” Iran says Europe may not be able to safeguard the nuclear deal anyway and accused European officials of dragging their feet. Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister and senior nuclear negotiator Abbas Araqchi said last week “operational steps” were needed from Europe as political support not enough. Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, head of Iran’s powerful Assembly of Experts said on Thursday Europe “would do nothing in our interest.” “The Europeans are worse than the Americans. If not, they are not any better,” he said, state TV reported. Last March, as part of efforts to convince Trump to stick to the nuclear deal, France, Britain and Germany proposed asset freezes and travel bans on the IRGC and Iranian companies and groups developing the missile programme, according to a document seen by Reuters. Now, a similar set of measures is being prepared, three diplomats say. “We’d prefer not to take these measures, but they need to stop trying to kill people on our territory and over the last three years they have beefed up their ballistic programme,” said one senior European diplomat. The diplomats say getting all 28 EU members to agree will take time. The EU’s top diplomat Federica Mogherini, who helped seal the 2015 deal, is wary of moving too fast for fear of provoking a complete collapse of the accord, four diplomats said. EU foreign ministers planned to issue a rare joint statement on Jan. 21 about what they say is Iran’s interference in the region and calling for an end to missile tests. Diplomats said Mogherini wants to see the SPV established first. An EU official denied any split in policy between Mogherini and EU governments, saying the statement will be published as soon as the SPV is launched. EU diplomats said eastern European governments could also go too far against Iran to please Trump in return for security guarantees against Russia. EU diplomats said there was a risk that a two-day conference in Poland in February focused on the Middle East, particularly Iran, convened by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, could divide eastern and western Europe. Mogherini is unable to attend due to another official engagement, an EU official said, and it is not clear at what level France, Britain and Germany will be represented.

EU delay in implementing financial channel unacceptable: Kharrazi MNA – The head of Iran’s Foreign Policy Strategic Council Kamal Kharrazi said Sat. the European Union’s delay in implementing the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to continue trade with Iran despite US sanctions under the pretext of their incapability of convincing European companies is unacceptable. Kamal Kharrazi, head of Iran’s Foreign Policy Strategic Council Kamal Kharrazi, who has also served as the Iranian foreign minister, made the remarks in a meeting with a visiting delegation of researches from the Italian International Affairs Institute (IAI Instituto Affari Internaziobali). Kharrazi said that the pressures that US administration is inflicting on Iran would weaken and divide Europe, adding “the US action in holding anti-Iran conference in Poland is aimed at escalating divisions among the European countries.” The former Iranian foreign minister added that while Iran honestly adhered to the nuclear deal also known as the JCPOA, now the public opinion in Iran is turning against Europe for its lack of action in implementing the promised financial channel to (or the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)). He referred to the successive delays by the European countries in implementing the SPV, “the claim that the European countries are incapable of convincing and guiding the European countries to financially cooperate with Iran with Iran is condemned and unacceptable according to international law.” Kharrazi further made it clear that Iran will not give in to pressures on the way to preserve its independence. The Italian delegation, for their part, stressed that Iran’s expectation for the practical steps by Europe to benefit from the nuclear deal is understandable. The Italians further described the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal as in violation of the international law, while acknowledging that Europe hugely depends on the United States.

Iran vows to reconsider cooperation with Europe in case of new sanctions Iran Press TV Sat Jan 26, 2019 02:06AM Iran has strongly censured France for threatening to impose new sanctions against the Islamic Republic over its missile program, vowing to reconsider its relations with European countries in case such bans are imposed. The remarks were made by Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi in reaction to earlier comments by French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. "Iran's military capabilities are part of the country's legitimate defense power and a guarantor of the Islamic Republic's national security, which is based on the doctrine of deterrence," Qassemi said Friday. "The Islamic Republic has designed its defense capabilities based on a realistic assessment of the existing threats," he said, vowing that the country would strengthen such capabilities to the extent it deems necessary. "Iran's missile capability is not negotiable, and this has been brought to the attention of the French side during the ongoing political dialogue between Iran and France," he said. Qassemi further noted that Le Drian's threat to impose new missile sanctions is against the spirit of political talks and cooperation between the two countries. He also vowed that Iran will reconsider its interaction with European countries in case these states impose any new sanctions against Tehran. "Iran has always sought to consolidate peace and stability in the region, and believes the mass sale of sophisticated and assault weapons by the US and some European countries, including France, has undermined regional stability and balance," he said. Qassemi's remarks came after the top French diplomat said his country is ready to impose further sanctions on Iran if no progress is made in talks over Tehran's ballistic missile program. "We are ready, if the talks don't yield results, to apply sanctions firmly, and they know it," Le Drian told reporters. Diplomats previously told Reuters that new sanctions being considered by EU countries over the missile issue could include asset freezes and travel bans on the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRCG) and people involved in Iran's ballistic missile program. Le Drian's threatening remarks come as the European Union is expected to launch its exclusive payment mechanism, known as Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), for facilitating non-dollar trade with Iran in a bid to circumvent the US sanctions against the Islamic Republic. The SPV "should be implemented in the coming days," Le Drian told the French parliament's foreign affairs committee on Wednesday. "It will work as a sort of clearing house that will allow in euros for Iran to benefit from some of its oil resources and at the same time buy essential products from the main three main (European) partners," he added. In May 2018, US President Donald Trump withdrew his country from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, under which Tehran agreed to put limits on its nuclear program in exchange for the removal of nuclear-related sanctions, and decided to re-impose unilateral sanctions against Tehran.

News article:
The Trump administration is closely eyeing efforts in Europe to set up an alternative money payment channel to ease doing business with Iran and avoid running afoul of sanctions the US has levied on the Islamic Republic. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook STRONG> and Twitter The White House is putting the Europeans on notice, saying that if they try to do an end-run around US sanctions on Iran, they will be subject to stiff fines and penalties. Unfazed, the European Union is marching forward with the plan, which, if implemented, could further strain trans-Atlantic relations. Donald Trump (Photo: AP) A spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said preparations for the alternative system were "at an advanced stage." "I hope that we can announce the launch very soon," Maja Kocijancic told reporters late last week in Brussels. Getting out ahead of a possible announcement, a senior administration official said on Friday that the US will fully enforce its sanctions and hold individuals and entities accountable for undermining them. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the issue. "The choice is whether to do business with Iran or the United States," Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told the AP. "I hope our European allies choose wisely." The US joined China, France, Germany, Russia and Britain in signing a pact with Iran in 2015 that offered to lift economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran's pledge to rein in its nuclear weapons program. President Donald Trump called it a "horrible, one-sided deal." He pulled out of the pact last year and restored punishing US sanctions on Iran. Tehran, which denies wanting nuclear weapons, continues to abide by the agreement, and the remaining five nations in the pact are trying to keep it intact. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini (Photo: EPA) Restoring the sanctions regime is part of the Trump administration's "maximum pressure campaign" on the Iranians to force them to radically alter their policies on developing ballistic missiles, supporting regional militant groups and violating human rights. The US has many concerns about the alternative payment system, according to an outside Trump administration adviser. The adviser spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the key US worries. Long-term, the US worries that the alternative money payment system could become successful enough to compete with the international bank transfer system known as SWIFT. The fear is that it could eventually supplant SWIFT as the leading global institution for financial institutions to send and receive information about banking transactions. Secondly, the US is concerned that other countries might try to route transactions through the European system just to circumvent US sanctions, the adviser said. Thirdly, while the Europeans have signaled that the alternative money transfer system would be used only for humanitarian transactions, the US is suspicious that it could be used for non-humanitarian transactions to evade US sanctions, the adviser said. "We should oppose efforts to create foreign financial channels that Iran could use to circumvent America's maximum pressure campaign against it, especially when humanitarian exceptions are already in US sanctions laws," Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told the AP. As the administration prepares for the potential fallout from the possible the European move, it is pressing ahead with its sanctions campaign against Iran and preparing to co-host with Poland next month a conference that will focus on combatting Iranian threats. Iran's nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi (Photo: AP) On Thursday, Treasury imposed sanctions on two Iran-backed militias in Syria and on Qeshm Fars Air, an Iranian civilian airline it accuses of ferrying weapons and personnel to Syria to support President Bashar Assad's government. The sanctions block any assets those targeted might have in US jurisdictions and bar Americans from doing business with them. At the same time, the State Department told Congress earlier this month that it would waive some Iranian sanctions to allow US companies to sell spare parts to Iranian airlines, which need them to operate aging, American-built Boeing jets. The waivers raised questions on Capitol Hill because some lawmakers are weighing legislation to specifically target Iran's civilian aviation sector. And Iran hawks outside the administration have expressed concern too. Mark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said Iran's aviation sector is being used by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, a branch of the Iranian military that has ties to militant networks, which Iran uses to expand its influence in the region and abroad. "What effective controls does the administration have in place to ensure that the aircraft receiving these licensed services are not facilitating Iran's support for these destructive activities?" he asked.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print By Staff Writer The EU appears to be stalling on its implementation of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to maintain trade with Iran and evade US sanctions, according to reports from Brussels on Monday, January 28, mainly because there are differences between EU member states over one of its ten articles. One EU diplomat stated: that Spain is opposing an article referring to Europe’s talks with Iran about its presence in Yemen because the southern European country was not present at the talks. On Friday, when it was expected that the EU would be announcing its SPV imminently, the US, which is adamant about “fully” enforcing its sanctions against Iran, was reported to be closely watching the EU’s efforts. According to the Associated Press, the White House is putting Europe “on notice” and saying that there will be “stiff fines and penalties” if Europe does try to subvert US sanctions. Senator Tom Cotton said: “The choice is whether to do business with Iran or the United States… I hope our European allies choose wisely.” Earlier that day, Maja Kocijancic, the representative for the EU Foreign Policy Chief, said that preparations for the SPV were at an “advanced stage” and that the system could launch “very soon”, while an informed EU source said that the SPV would be registered on Monday, January 28. However, at the same time, the European Council would release a statement to express concern over Iran’s regional military ambitions, ballistic missile program, hostile acts in EU, and violation of human rights. Of course, even if the SPV has fallen through in the EU, as it should because it not only violates US sanctions but also props up a despotic Regime, the EU’s economic support of the Iranian Regime is nothing compared to the political support it offers by remaining a part of the 2015 nuclear deal and legitimising the mullahs. The Iranian people have made their view clear. They want the Iranian Regime removed from power and they are determined to do it with the help of their Resistance forces, but all the while that Western governments continue to treat the Iranian Regime like it is a “normal” government that they can have a meaningful dialogue with, they spit on the wishes of the Iranian people for freedom. The US withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran in May 2018, citing Iran’s cheating, which has only become more obvious as time has gone on and increased support of the Iranian people. The EU should do the same.

News article:
By Reza Shafiee The past few months have been rough in EU-Iran relationship. After the US President’s departure from the nuclear deal with Iran, EU has tried to salvage the deal on its own. But outlawed Iranian politicians have left very little room for the likes of enthusiastic EU’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini to maneuver in favor of the 2015 nuclear deal. Iran hits a raw nerve each time it stunts even its most optimistic backers with an announcement for testing a new ballistic missile. Only last week Iranian regime tested a new ballistic missile and told the world it was just a failed attempt to launch a new satellite in orbit. It is of course in direct violation of the Iranian regime’s obligation to adhere to UN Resolution 2231. But that is not the only issue the EU bloc has with Iran. Since 2015, starting with the Netherlands, Iran has been involved in a series of terrorist activities on European soil. Actions that the EU cannot afford to ignore. The bloc hit Iran with the first round of sanctions since 2015 Iran deal a few days ago. Although they are relatively mild they certainly send a strong message to Tehran that at the time the EU is trying to save the nuclear deal in the face of strong temptation from the US to leave Iran and instead impose crushing sanctions it expects the mullahs’ regime to behave. What happened on EU soil? Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and his cronies in the regime planned revenge for their main opposition in response to what had happened in late 2017 and throughout 2018 in Iran. Widespread protests in the country were not something that the Iranian regime could take lightly. Khamenei has not missed a single opportunity to remind its base support in Iran, paramilitary Basij Force and Revolutionary Guards, of the existential threat the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK), poses to the regime. Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) with its partner in crime, the Intelligence Unit of the Revolutionary Guards, and their sister, the Quds Force, are accomplices in cynical plans against the regime’s opposition. A section of the MOIS is the target of the January 8 sanctions imposed by the EU bloc. It all began by a failed MOIS plan to hit the Persian New Year Celebration of MEK in their new residence in Albania in March. Tehran has changed its pattern of dealing with its dissidents abroad and has removed the “moderation” mask altogether. In the 80s and early 90s, the nascent theocratic regime — not caring about the consequences of its actions — hunted down opposition figures in European capitals such as Paris, Berlin, and Rome. Now it seems that the ruling regime is revisiting the old terror tactics in Western cities again. The second stop in the renewed terror campaign — this time using Iranian trained spies turned diplomats instead of using proxies like Lebanese Hezbollah to do the dirty work — was where a large gathering of Iran’s main opposition the National Council of Resistance (NCRI) took place in Paris on June 30. Even as the rally unfolded, security forces in France, with the help of their German and Belgian partners, foiled a terrorist plot intending to target it. The timing of the plot was significant because Hassan Rouhani was scheduled to visit Austria the next day. Assadollah Assadi, with MOIS nickname, Daniel, masterminded the plot while under diplomatic immunity from the Austrian government. He was stationed in Vienna. Assadi was caught red-handed when he was giving the explosives and detonator to a sleeper cell, an Iranian born Belgian couple to carry out the attack. Later Assadi was extradited to Belgium where he is imprisoned waiting for his trial on terror charges. Assadi is one of two individuals named in the European Union’s first imposed sanctions against the Iranian regime since the nuclear accord was implemented three years ago. According to diplomatic and security sources last fall, France expelled an Iranian diplomat in response to the failed plot. France’s foreign ministry said on October 2, there was no doubt the Iranian intelligence ministry had been behind the plot against the June 30 rally in Paris. It subsequently froze assets belonging to Tehran’s intelligence services and two Iranian nationals. In July 2018, Dutch authorities said they had expelled two Iranian diplomats, who foreign officials say were linked to the assassinations of two Iranian dissidents. US officials believed Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security was involved. A Strong message from EU A strong message from EU was delivered on January 8th when French, British, German, Danish, Dutch, and Belgian diplomats arrived in the Iranian regime’s foreign ministry unexpected. The four EU diplomats were there to make sure Iran receives the message that the bloc will no longer tolerate Iranian regime’s missile tests and assassination plots on its soil. “There was a lot of drama, they didn’t like it, but we felt we had to convey our serious concerns,” one of the diplomats said. “It shows the relationship is becoming more tense,” a second diplomat said. The next day the EU imposed its first sanctions on Tehran since the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. On issues, missile proliferation and terrorism-the clerical regime’s officials with no exception- Khamenei, Hassan Rouhani and Revolutionary Guards close ranks. With a strong and growing grass root opposition to the Iranian regime at home, it is only wise for the EU officials to cut their losses and leave behind a failed policy of appeasing mullahs. It has only harmed the Iranian people and Europe alike. This article was also published at https://medium.com/intpolicydigest/eu-at-a-turning-point-with-iran-47db5e937e65

FM spokesman censures slow progress of INSTEX IRNA - Islamic Republic News Agency Tehran, Feb 18, IRNA -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman here on Monday criticized the slow progress of implementing the Instrument for Supporting Trade Exchanges between Iran and Europe (INSTEX) between Iran and Europe. Speaking in his weekly press briefing, Bahram Qasemi said INSTEX is still in its early stages and urged the European side to implement it as soon as possible. On January 31, Germany, France and the UK set up a payment channel with Iran called INSTEX, to help continue trade with Tehran and circumvent the US sanctions. The Paris-based transactions channel, named INSTEX - Instrument In Support Of Trade Exchanges, is run by a German national, and the three countries are shareholders in it. The US is not happy with improving Iran-Europe relations, he said, adding that Washington is continuing its pressures and acts of sabotage against Tehran. He added an expert meeting, attended by European officials and the Iranian foreign ministry and economic apparatus, would be held to review the INSTEX within days. Qasemi pointed out that Iran has made it clear to Europe that the patience of the Iranian nation and government "is not limitless" so the Europeans should implement it very fast. Elsewhere in his remarks, he noted that Europe's financial mechanism for trade with Iran and the four Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) bills in the country are not interrelated. Qasemi underlined that the Islamic Republic of Iran is not a county which would yield to terms and conditions. 9060**1424 NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

The Diplomatic-Security Cabinet is expected within two weeks to approve a major cut to the tax revenues that Israel collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority, with the amount the P.A. pays to terrorists and their families to be deducted from the money Israel hands over to the P.A. The reduction will be enacted under a law passed this past summer by Knesset members Elazar Stern (Yesh Atid) and Avi Dichter (Likud), which requires the Defense Ministry to provide the cabinet with data on the amount the P.A. pays terrorists and their families. The Finance Ministry will then withhold that amount from the tax funds. For some weeks, the Defense Ministry has been assiduously collecting figures to determine the exact amount that the P.A. pays out in “terror salaries.” According to the mechanism stipulated by the law, after a report on the salaries is presented, the Finance Ministry will carry out the deduction. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said in closed-door talks that the deduction will go ahead, although he expressed concern that the reduced tax funds would hurt the stability of the P.A. He also said he would look for a way to carry out the demands of the law while ensuring that the P.A. remains stable. Dichter, who serves as chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, said in response to recent reports on the amount of the P.A. terror salaries that “every shekel the Palestinian Authority pays to terrorists will be deducted [from the tax funds.] That is how we create deterrence against terrorism.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Israel Hayom recently reported that in 2018, the P.A. paid out 502 million shekels ($138 million) to living terrorists. A probe by the Palestinian Media Watch group showed that at least 230 million shekels ($63 million) had been paid to terrorists currently in prison. The government ministries involved in the deduction have not yet specified the amount to be withheld from the tax revenues Israel will hand over to the Palestinian Authority.

News article:
Israel’s Security Cabinet approved the implementation of a law on Sunday to deduct funds from tax revenue withheld from the Palestinian Authority over its payments to terrorists and their families. The move would deduct funds equal to the amount the P.A. spent to support terrorists and their families in 2018. The Israeli decision did not, however, include deducting funds equal to the amount the P.A. spends on so-called “martyrs,” experts noted. Member of Knesset Elazar Stern, one of the sponsors of the bill passed in July requiring the government to deduct such payments, told JNS that he supported the Security Cabinet’s decision. “I commend the Cabinet on its decision to finally approve the law that I initiated and led together with MK Avi Dichter and deduct terror salaries. I have no doubt that, ultimately, the implementation of the law will drastically reduce the incentive for terrorism and the number of terror attacks.” The decision by the Security Cabinet comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had come under increasing pressure to implement the law following the brutal murder of Israeli teen Ori Ansbacher by a Palestinian terrorist earlier this month. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories According to reports, the $138 million is likely be deducted over a 12-month period. Ahmed Majdalani, a senior official in the Palestine Liberation Organization, accused Israel as well as the United States, which passed a similar law earlier in 2018 known as the Taylor Force Act, of blackmail. “The occupation government is seeking to destroy the national authority in partnership with the U.S. administration of Donald Trump,” Majdalani said in a statement. Decision does not include deductions for Palestinian martyr payments According to Maurice Hirsch, head of legal strategies for Palestinian Media Watch (PMW), “We welcome the decision of the government as a great start.” However, Hirsch emphasized that the government only deducted the payments to terrorist prisoners and released prisoners. The government “did not touch at this point the P.A. payments to the families of dead or wounded terrorists,” he noted. “Our (PMW) estimate is that the sum paid to the dead terrorists alone, without the wounded, is over $63 million.” Hirsch added, “It is just a shame that the Ministry of Defense didn’t use the last six months since the law passed in order to calculate the amount the P.A. pays to the families of the dead and wounded terrorists.” According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Netanyahu “instructed security officials to step up checks on additional Palestinian Authority payments linked to terrorism, including those to terrorists and their families. The amount frozen will be updated as per the information received.” Sander Gerber, CEO of Hudson Bay Capital Management who has been raising awareness about the Palestinian Authority’s “pay to slay” policy for a number of years now, told JNS that “as the P.A. struggles with the moral dilemma to pay a prisoner who is both a killer and a rapist, it is an achievement that the State of Israel has the clarity to implement a law passed eight months ago to reduce money transfers equivalent to the amount the P.A. pays prisoners. We can only hope that the martyr program will not be overlooked by the government.” Shai Maimon, a victim of terror and heavily involved in advancing this law against terror funding, told JNS, “I am very happy that the government has come to terms with the law that it passed in the last Knesset. We are witnessing history in the making.” He, too, was disappointed that the Security Cabinet did not approve offsetting the complete amount of funding. “This is only half of the amount that the P.A. transfers to terrorists and their families, and therefore the government must continue to demand that the entire amount be offset in the future.”

News article:
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has rejected all tax revenue payments transferred to the PA by Israel, in response to Jerusalem withholding over $138 million of the amount over Ramallah’s payouts to Palestinian attackers and their families. The dramatic move means the PA is rejecting a large portion of its monthly income, which could lead to its financial collapse. Palestinian officials said Israel currently collects and transfers NIS 803,282,580 ($222 million) to the PA every month, Reuters reported. Israel’s security cabinet on Sunday approved withholding NIS 502,697,000 ($138 million) from a year’s worth of taxes that Israel is slated to collect on the PA’s behalf. The security cabinet’s decision was an effort to start implementing a new law that permits Israel to withhold tax money due Ramallah over payments it makes to security prisoners held by Israel and the families of slain attackers, including terrorists. “We refuse to receive all of the tax funds. We don’t want them. Leave them over with them,” Abbas told a delegation of US Congress members and the dovish Jewish organization J Street at the PA presidential headquarters in Ramallah on Tuesday.

I mean if the [Palestinian] Authority doesn’t have anything other than that [amount], I will pay it to the families of martyrs and prisoners and wounded persons. This needs to be understood,” he said, according to recordings of comments aired Wednesday on Voice of Palestine, the official PA radio station. “In addition, I will turn to all international institutions to complain. Perhaps the world will hear me,” Abbas added. A high-ranking Palestinian official insisted on Tuesday that the Palestinians cannot stop its payments to security prisoners or the families of slain attackers, calling such a move “political suicide.” Advertisement “These payments are one of the most sensitive issues in Palestinian society,” the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Times of Israel. “If the PA were to get rid of them, it would be committing political suicide, especially considering the difficult political situation.” Palestinian officials have condemned Israel for moving to withhold the half billion shekels, arguing it amounts to “piracy” of Palestinian funds. Israeli officials have defended the security cabinet’s decision, arguing that the PA’s payments incentivize violence and terrorism. Avi Dichter, the chair of the Knesset Defense Committee, has said Israel will spread out the withholding of the tax money over 12 months. If Israel continues to collect a sum of taxes equivalent to that provided in the Reuters report, it will withhold approximately five percent of what it now transfers to the PA on a monthly basis. Abbas’s rejection of all tax revenues could mean a PA forfeiture of hundreds of millions of shekels each month – several billion a year, and perhaps as much as a third of the PA’s total budget, as Times of Israel analyst Avi Issacharoff pointed out this week.

But Israel is now in the middle of an election, in which a right-wing incumbent government could find itself politically unable to appear to cave to the Palestinian threat.” Polls have found that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians oppose the PA suspending its payments to security prisoners, including terrorists who have killed Israeli civilians. A survey published in July 2017 by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found that 91 percent of Palestinians were against halting the payments. Israeli security officials have long supported strengthening the PA and have argued that initiatives to weaken it could destabilize the situation in the West Bank and hinder the ability of PA security forces to fight terrorism. Adam Rasgon contributed to this report.

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has rejected all tax revenue payments transferred to the PA by Israel, in response to Jerusalem withholding over $138 million of the amount over Ramallah’s payouts to Palestinian attackers and their families. The dramatic move means the PA is rejecting a large portion of its monthly income, which could lead to its financial collapse. Palestinian officials said Israel currently collects and transfers NIS 803,282,580 ($222 million) to the PA every month, Reuters reported. Israel’s security cabinet on Sunday approved withholding NIS 502,697,000 ($138 million) from a year’s worth of taxes that Israel is slated to collect on the PA’s behalf. The security cabinet’s decision was an effort to start implementing a new law that permits Israel to withhold tax money due Ramallah over payments it makes to security prisoners held by Israel and the families of slain attackers, including terrorists. “We refuse to receive all of the tax funds. We don’t want them. Leave them over with them,” Abbas told a delegation of US Congress members and the dovish Jewish organization J Street at the PA presidential headquarters in Ramallah on Tuesday.

This needs to be understood,” he said, according to recordings of comments aired Wednesday on Voice of Palestine, the official PA radio station. “In addition, I will turn to all international institutions to complain. Perhaps the world will hear me,” Abbas added. A high-ranking Palestinian official insisted on Tuesday that the Palestinians cannot stop its payments to security prisoners or the families of slain attackers, calling such a move “political suicide.” Advertisement “These payments are one of the most sensitive issues in Palestinian society,” the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Times of Israel. “If the PA were to get rid of them, it would be committing political suicide, especially considering the difficult political situation.” Palestinian officials have condemned Israel for moving to withhold the half billion shekels, arguing it amounts to “piracy” of Palestinian funds. Israeli officials have defended the security cabinet’s decision, arguing that the PA’s payments incentivize violence and terrorism. Avi Dichter, the chair of the Knesset Defense Committee, has said Israel will spread out the withholding of the tax money over 12 months. If Israel continues to collect a sum of taxes equivalent to that provided in the Reuters report, it will withhold approximately five percent of what it now transfers to the PA on a monthly basis. Abbas’s rejection of all tax revenues could mean a PA forfeiture of hundreds of millions of shekels each month – several billion a year, and perhaps as much as a third of the PA’s total budget, as Times of Israel analyst Avi Issacharoff pointed out this week. Advertisement “It could mean, in other words, the de facto collapse of the PA,” he wrote. “When the PA threatened to do so in the past, Israel caved each time, fearing a spike in violence that could ensue after the PA’s disappearance. But Israel is now in the middle of an election, in which a right-wing incumbent government could find itself politically unable to appear to cave to the Palestinian threat.” Polls have found that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians oppose the PA suspending its payments to security prisoners, including terrorists who have killed Israeli civilians.

News article:
By Dov Benovadia YERUSHALAYIM — If Israel indeed does not transfer to the Palestinian Authority all the money it collects in taxes on its behalf and holds back hundreds of millions of shekels because of the payments of the PA to terrorists and their families, the PA will stop paying salaries to employees – including to security personnel, PA police equipped with weapons, beginning next month, a Lebanese report said. The move is designed to pressure Israel not to cut the payments, and to incite opposition to the impending Washington-based “deal of the century” peace plan that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump will present after the Israeli elections. The report in the Lebanese Al-Ahabar newspaper, Thursday, reflected comments by PA chief Mahmoud Abbas, Wednesday. At a meeting of top PA leadership, Abbas said that if Israel withheld any money, the PA would refuse to accept all of it – and it would also cancel economic agreements with Israel. The move by Israel “is the final nail in the coffin of the Paris Accords,” Yisrael Hayom quoted Abbas as telling top PA terrorists. “Israel is violating these agreements and the implications will be very serious. This is another siege of the Palestinians, who are already collapsing because of the evils of the occupation. All of these moves against us are part of the Trump plan. We will not allow this to happen,” Abbas said. On Tuesday, Abbas met with a delegation from the far-left J Street group, and told them that if Israel deducted any money from the transfer payments, the PA would turn down the rest. “It’s all or nothing,” he told the group. “Even if we had just a small amount of money, NIS 20 or 30 million, our priority would be paying” the terrorists and their families. “We don’t need Israel’s money,” the newspaper quoted Abbas as telling the group. There have been varying estimates of just how much the PA lays out for salaries for terrorists in Israeli prisons – paid directly to them or their families – and as pension payments for terrorists killed in the act of murdering Israelis. The Cabinet earlier this week said it would withhold about NIS 580 million in payments to the PA. Abbas’s office reacted angrily to the decision. “This is an outrageous decision that will completely destroy our agreements with Israel. This decision will harm the economic development of the PA,” Abbas’s office said in a statement. With that, the PA will not stop its payments to terrorists. “We will not do business with our rights,” it said. “The deduction of money is robbery of money that belongs to the Palestinian people. We will not allow any harm to the income of our heroes and the families of the martyrs and the injured. This decision will have implications on many levels. We will consider it in the next meeting of the Palestinian leadership in the coming days,” it added. The decision came on the same day that the Cabinet approved that a mechanism should be in place to deduct money transferred to the PA in the amount of payouts to terrorists, as required by Knesset legislation passed last July that came into effect on January 1. The deductions come from customs payments Israel collects on behalf of the PA, in accordance with the Paris Accords, which regulate economic relations between Israel and the PA.

Palestinians burn a banner depicting US President Donald Trump (right) and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahou with swastikas drawn on their foreheads as they protest in the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem on Tuesday, against Israel's Cabinet decision, a day earlier, to withhold tax transfers to the Palestinian Authority over its payments to prisoners jailed for attacks on Israelis (AFP photo) OCCUPIED JERUSALEM — Israel has decided to block tens of millions of dollars in tax transfers to the Palestinian Authority over payments to prisoners jailed for attacks. Here is a series of questions and answers on what it means: What taxes? In 1994, Israel and the Palestinians signed the Paris Protocol, which would become part of the landmark Oslo peace accords. It governs economic relations and established a customs union between Israel and the Palestinian territories, with Israel controlling the borders. Israel levies VAT and tariffs on products imported into the Palestinian territories and transfers them to the Palestinian Authority. The transfers make up around 70 per cent of the PA's revenue, according to Palestinian political scientist Jihad Harb. Israel's finance ministry says it collects around 700 million shekels ($190 million, 170 million euros) in taxes each month on Palestinian imports. From that, it deducts 100 million shekels to cover various services delivered to Palestinians. The arrangement was meant to be temporary as the two sides worked towards a final agreement, but it remains in place with peace efforts stalled and the Palestinian economy remains heavily dependent on Israel. What did Israel decide? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government decided Sunday to withhold $138 million in tax transfers to the PA over its payments to the families of prisoners, or the prisoners themselves, jailed for attacks on Israelis. The amount is to be deducted incrementally over 12 months. Israel says it is equal to that paid by the PA last year to those "imprisoned in Israel, to their families and to released prisoners". A law passed in July allowed the government to take the step, and Netanyahu vowed to implement it after a recent deadly attack on a young Israeli woman. Israel has also used the measure in the past to sanction the Palestinian Authority (PA). What are prisoner payments? Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas’ administration provides money to families of Palestinians killed or jailed as part of the conflict with Israel, with the amount depending on their sentences. Israel as well as the United States allege the payments to those who have carried out attacks encourage further violence and undermine Abbas’ argument that he is committed to peace. The PA has never divulged the amount it pays out. An Israeli lawmaker behind the 2018 law alleged it was 1.2 billion shekels last year. The PA says the payments are a form of welfare to the families who have lost their main breadwinner and denies it is seeking to encourage violence. Sahar Francis, head of Palestinian prisoners NGO Addameer, said the money constitutes “social insurance”. More than 5,000 Palestinians are detained in Israel, Addameer says. What are the financial consequences? “Even without this decision, the PA was already facing large budget deficits,” said Robert Tchaidze, IMF representative for the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The IMF in September forecast a deficit of $620 million in 2018. For 2019, anticipating a freeze in transfers larger than what was announced on Sunday, the IMF predicted a deficit of around $1 billion. The freeze comes on top of a dramatic drop in direct foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority budget, which has gone from 10 per cent of GDP five years ago to 3.5 per cent last year. In 2018, the United States cut hundreds of millions of dollars in Palestinian aid. The financial crisis could worsen further if Abbas sticks to his ultimatum announced on Wednesday, when he said the PA will refuse to accept a partial transfer from Israel. Palestinian economist Nasser Abdelkarim spoke of “the start of an enormous financial and economic crisis”. What are the security implications? Security officials in Israel, which is in the midst of an electoral campaign, worry over the impact that the freeze could have on the stability of the West Bank and the blockaded Gaza Strip. UN Envoy for the Middle East Peace Process Nickolay Mladenov said on Wednesday that the freeze and other financial pressures “put at risk the financial stability of the Palestinian Authority and ultimately the security of both Israelis and Palestinians alike”. According to Harb, even if Arab countries extend financial help, the crisis threatens to affect the PA’s ability to contain “violence or protests against the Israeli occupation”.

News article:
Not long after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israel would begin deducting $138 million of terror funding from the tax money that it collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority each month, Mahmoud Abbas announced that the P.A. would refuse all of the tax money it was owed. “This wasn’t the first time that claim was made,” said Palestinian Media Watch’s Maurice Hirsch. Indeed, P.A. chief Abbas has been threatening to do so for several weeks. And again on Wednesday, while addressing a delegation of J Street advocacy group and U.S. Congressmen in Ramallah, Abbas again announced that he “will not take any deducted funds” from Israel. According to Eugene Kontorovich, director of International Law at the Jerusalem-based Kohelet Policy Forum and professor of International Law at George Mason University in Washington, D.C., “Abbas’s refusal to accept transfers of customs funds from Israel reveals the priorities of the Palestinian Authority: It values funding terrorism above all else, and engineers suffering for its own people as a diplomatic weapon against Israel.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories He continued, saying “Israel’s withholding of tax revenues that the P.A. uses to pay terrorists is entirely reasonable, and the P.A.’s response is to honestly admit that the pay-to-slay program is its raison d’être.” So far, Israel has only decided to deduct funds that go to Palestinian terrorists incarcerated in jail. It has yet to deduct funds that go to “martyrs” and their families.

News article:
West Bank – The Palestinian Authority has rejected the first 2019 monthly tax transfer from Israel because it slashed the portion designated for financial support to families of militants who are jailed in Israel, a PA minister said. The decision came despite increasing cash flow troubles, caused in part by U.S. aid cuts, that could destabilize the PA, an interim self-government body set up following the 1993 Oslo accords between the Palestinians and Israel. Under the interim accords, Israel collects taxes on imports into the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, an enclave under Palestinian Islamist rule since 2007, and makes monthly transfers of the proceeds to the PA. The tax transfers make up about half of the PA’s budget, according to Palestinian Finance Ministry data. On Feb. 17, Israel announced a freeze on about 5 percent of that money affecting stipends the PA pays to families of Palestinian militants killed or jailed by Israel. In response, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the PA itself would keep paying the stipends rather than accept a partial tax transfer. “We have refused to receive the 700 million shekel ($194 million) transfer after Israel deducted 42 million shekels from it,” Hussein al-Sheikh, the PA minister of civil affairs, told Reuters regarding the monthly transfer. The Israeli finance ministry declined to comment. Some analysts see potential danger if PA financial troubles mount in the West Bank, where the Authority maintains security cooperation with Israel even as Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been stalled for years. “Coupled with other de-funding measures, stability in the West Bank is being compromised in worrying ways,” said Tareq Baconi of the International Crisis Group think tank. But he said Israel may reverse its decision rather than risk a PA collapse. Palestinian Finance Minister Shukri Bishara said last week the PA faced “difficult days” in the coming weeks, hinting it might have to cut the salaries of some civil servants. Israel and the United States say the PA’s stipend policy fans Palestinian violence while the Palestinians see the slain and jailed Palestinians as heroes of a national struggle to end Israeli occupation and create an independent state. The United States passed legislation last year to sharply reduce aid to the PA unless it stopped the pay-outs. Washington has slashed hundreds of millions of dollars of funding to humanitarian organizations and U.N. agencies which aid the Palestinians as it seeks to pressure Abbas to enter peace negotiations with Israel.

News article:
The Palestinian Authority on Wednesday said it rejected its regular monthly tax transfer from Israel to protest an Israeli decision to deduct sums of money that Palestine pay to the families of people killed, injured or imprisoned for attacks on Israel. Hussein al-Sheikh, the Palestinian official who coordinates the Palestinian Authority's communication with Israel, announced the rejection of the tax transfers. Israel announced last week that it would withhold over $138 million in revenues to penalize the Palestinian leadership for paying stipends to Palestinian attackers and their families. Under interim peace deals, Israel collects customs duties and other taxes on behalf of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, and transfers the funds to Palestine each month. These transfers cover roughly two-thirds of the Palestinian government budget. The freeze of these funds will deal a dire financial blow to the cash-strapped Palestinian leadership, already weakened by the recent U.S. cuts of more than $200 million in bilateral aid. The authority expects it won't be able to pay its employees' full salaries. Israel says the stipends to prisoners' families encourage violence. Palestine describes the payments as an important form of social welfare and say they are responsible to all of their citizens. Although the rejection of the funds is likely to hurt them, the Palestinians are hoping that the move will put pressure on Israel to reverse course. A collapse of the Palestinian Authority could lead to the end of security cooperation with Israel, and theoretically force Israel to assume responsibility over the more than 2 million Palestinians in the West Bank. In other developments, Israel separately arrested two high-profile Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank. In Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, Israel's Shin Bet security service arrested a well-known Palestinian for "severe and current terrorist activity." Zakaria Zubeidi rose to fame during the second Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s, and later ran the militia affiliated with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party. For years, Zubeidi was on Israel's "most wanted" list before being granted amnesty. But a decade later, Zubeidi leads a very different life as manager of prisoner affairs for the Palestinian Authority, founder of a local theater company and student of political science at Birzeit University. His relatives contend he has long abstained from militant activity. The sudden arrest baffled Palestinian analysts, prompting suspicions that Israel was leveraging Zubeidi's past infamy to score political points as national elections approach. Meanwhile in Jerusalem, Israeli authorities released Adnan Ghaith, Jerusalem's Palestinian governor, after holding him for several hours, according to local media reports. A Jerusalem court has ruled to release Ghaith, who was detained earlier Wednesday alongside 20 other Palestinians, including prominent lawyer Medhat Dibeh. The reason for the raft of detentions remains unclear. According to one source who attended the court session, implementation of the release order was briefly suspended "to give Israeli intelligence a chance to appeal the decision." "If the intelligence apparatus doesn't challenge the ruling, he'll be released," said the source, who spoke anonymously due to restrictions on talking to media. The arrests come at a time of escalating tension in Jerusalem and the West Bank. Unrest between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police erupted last week around Al-Aqsa Mosque, long a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Palestinian worshippers re-opened a building in the sacred compound that has been closed by Israeli court order for over a decade, staging prayer-protests inside several times over the past week. In response, Israel arrested dozens of east Jerusalem residents and briefly detained the head of the Islamic authority that oversees Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem. Kobi Michael, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies, said there is "no doubt" that the timing of the upcoming Israeli elections in April plays a role in the apparent mounting troubles between Israel and Palestine. "The situation is very sensitive and very fragile right now," said Michael. "It looks like the tension that has been building up here might explode."

News article:
Lithuania said Friday it has rejected a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to move the remains of Vilna Gaon, a famed 18th-century rabbi, from Vilnius to Israel for reburial, Trend reports referring to The Times of Israel. The issue was raised during talks between Netanyahu and his Lithuanian counterpart Saulius Skvernelis in Jerusalem on Tuesday, Skvernelis’ national security advisor Arnoldas Pikzirnis told AFP. “We received a kind request to consider whether the remains of Vilna Gaon could be relocated to Israel,” Pikzirnis said. The request was denied, he said, because “Vilna Gaon is an inseparable part of Lithuania’s Jewish community and Lithuania history.” Jewish community leader Faina Kukliansky, who also attended the Jerusalem talks, told AFP that removing the rabbi’s remains from Vilnius was “out of the question.” Kukliansky said the legacy of rabbi and scholar Elijah ben Shlomo Zalman, known as Vilna Gaon, was a crucial part of the history of Lithuania’s once thriving Jewish community. Netanyahu first privately raised the idea when he visited Vilnius in August, a government source and a Jewish community source who met him during the trip told AFP. A spokesman for Netanyahu in Jerusalem did not immediately comment. Amir Maimon, Israel’s ambassador to Vilnius, also declined to comment but did not explicitly deny that Netanyahu made the request. Vilna Gaon spent most of his life in Vilnius, then a hub of Yiddish intellectual life known as the “Jerusalem of the North.” He died in 1797 at the age of 77, and was buried in the Snipiskes cemetery in Vilnius. His remains were moved to a new cemetery on the capital’s outskirts in the 1950s. Before World War II, Lithuania’s vibrant Jewish community numbered around 200,000 people. Over 90 percent of them perished between 1941-1944 during the Holocaust at the hands of the Nazis and their local collaborators.

News article:
The government of Cameroon has apologized to Israel for an incendiary remark made by one of its officials describing the Nazi Holocaust as having been brought on by Jewish “arrogance.” Deputy Justice Minister Jean de Dieu Momo made the comment during an interview on state television on Sunday in the context of the African country’s current political woes. Asked why he thought the detained opposition leader Maurice Kamto had refused to accept defeat following the Oct. 7 presidential election, Momo invoked the Nazi persecution of the Jews. “In Germany, there was a race of very rich people. They had enormous economic power,” the deputy minister said. “And they were so arrogant that the German people felt a little nervous. Then one day, a certain Hitler came to power and put these populations in gas chambers.” The remark was understood as a warning to the Bamiléké ethnic group which Kamto belongs to, who have a “reputation for being successful businessmen,” according to the BBC‘s “Africa Live” program. Momo, who is also an ethnic Bamiléké, said it would be wrong for the group to seek political power alongside its economic influence, and suggested that trying to do so could be dangerous for the entire community. In a statement on Monday, the Israeli embassy in Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, “strongly” condemned Momo’s comment, which it said “makes a tacit justification of the Holocaust by Nazi Germany.” Shortly after Israel voiced its criticism of Momo, the Cameroon government distanced itself from the deputy minister’s remarks. “The government of the Republic of Cameroon would like to stress that the minister concerned was speaking in a personal capacity,” Communications Minister René Emmanuel Sadi said in a statement to the AFP news agency on Tuesday. Sadi added that the government “deplores” the Momo’s comment, but did not elaborate on whether he would face further censure. Watch Cameroon government minister’s comment about the Holocaust below:

News article:
Asharq Al-Awsat Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks at the Warsaw summit earlier this week sparked a diplomatic crisis with his host after reported comments appeared to show him accuse Poland of complicity in the Nazi Holocaust. The Israeli PM was in the Polish capital to attend a conference on the Middle East. Israel's Haaretz newspaper quoted Netanyahu as saying: "The Poles collaborated with the Nazis, and I don't know anyone who was ever sued for such a statement." Yaakov Katz, the Jerusalem Post's editor, told Reuters the account in his newspaper had used the term "Polish nation", although not in a direct quote from Netanyahu, and the story was swiftly amended to reflect what he really said. The Polish Foreign Ministry summoned the Israeli ambassador for an explanation. But a deputy foreign minister, Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek, said the explanations given by Israel so far are "unclear" and that Warsaw is still awaiting a clarification that would leave it without any doubts. Poland has expressed an "expectation that the Israeli side will say in a clear way what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meant when he said the words that were quoted by the Israeli media," Szynkowski vel Sek said. He added, though, that this did not impact on the leaders' upcoming meeting slated to start Monday in Jerusalem. Commenting on Netanyahu's remarks, Polish President Andrzej Duda raised a question mark over a two-day summit in Jerusalem next week of the four central European nations - Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Duda said that if Netanyahu had said what was originally reported, "Israel would not be a good place to meet in spite of the previous arrangements". He offered his own presidential residence as an alternative venue. Later, Netanyahu's office weighed in with another statement, saying: "Netanyahu spoke of Poles and not the Polish people or the country of Poland. This was misquoted and misrepresented in press reports and was subsequently corrected by the journalist who issued the initial misstatement." Netanyahu has sought to use the so-called Visegrad group as a counterweight to western European Union criticism of Israel's policies towards the Palestinians. The Holocaust is still an extremely sensitive subject in Poland, even nearly 80 years after World War II.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week approached and briefly spoke with Austrian Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl despite a formal boycott, according to a senior official in Vienna. The Prime Minister’s Office denied the claim. In response to a query about the encounter, the PMO said in a statement: “Israel’s policy has not changed with regard to the party. The minister surprised the prime minister and approached him unexpectedly. There was no conversation or meeting.” Kneissl was appointed to her post by the far-right Freedom Party, which Jerusalem shuns due to its closeness to the neo-Nazi scene. She is not formally a member of the party and her office refused to comment on the reported meeting. If it indeed took place, the encounter, which is said to have occurred Thursday at the sidelines of an international conference in Warsaw, would indicate that the Israeli government is no longer adhering to its declared policy of refraining from contact with officials affiliated with the FPOe, as the party is known in German. A senior diplomatic official in Vienna confirmed to The Times of Israel that a brief meeting, including “some small talk,” took place at the sidelines of the so-called Ministerial to Promote a Future of Peace and Security in the Middle East” in the Polish capital, minutes after a photo of all delegates was taken. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Netanyahu approached Kneissl and a “short, friendly exchange of words” ensued, the senior official told The Times of Israel, speaking on condition of anonymity. “I think that this meeting is an additional sign that the boycott against Mrs. Kneissl could end soon,” the official added. Officially, Israel has not changed its no-contact policy regarding the FPOe and officials affiliated with the party, though it has long been rumored that Jerusalem may consider easing establishing a relationship with Kneissl, since she holds the foreign portfolio and is not officially a member of the party. The Austrian Jewish community continues to advocate for a full boycott of the party — and Kneissl. Advertisement “It’s Israel’s decision how to deal with the FPOe. We in the Austrian Jewish community have a democratically elected board with seven different parties and a total of 24 members. This board has unanimously decided not to have any contact with the FPOe, not because of the party’s past, but because of the incidents in the present,” Austrian Jewish community leader Oskar Deutsch told The Times of Israel in a recent interview. “I believe the Israeli government is following the situation closely, and its policy is very reasonable. But it’s up to them,” Deutsch said. “I speak on behalf of my community — we have so far no reason to change our decision.” Kneissl attends all major FPOe events and has so far failed to condemn FPOe-led attacks on shehita, or kosher ritual slaughter, and the numerous Nazi scandals party members are involved in, Deutsch lamented. Would Austrian Jews be unhappy if Israel established contact with FPOe or Kneissl? “Austrian Jews are very happy with many of the decisions the Israeli government makes, and less happy with some others. Not everyone agrees with everything,” Deutsch replied diplomatically. “Of course, I am satisfied with the Israeli government’s course until now. But if they change course at some point, I will take note of that decision. What else could I do? I don’t see a reason why the government should change its position now,” he said. Advertisement Noting that it is a hypothetical question, Deutsch indicated that he may not publicly criticize Jerusalem if it indeed changes its policy on the FPOe or Kneissl. “There are enough people in the world attacking Israel. I do not want to publicly attack the Israeli government,” he said, adding that Jerusalem’s current position “makes its foreign policy a truly Jewish position. Why should Jerusalem give up a Jewish foreign policy?” he asked rhetorically. The Israeli government has “good reasons” for its policies vis-à-vis ministers running on an FPOe ticket, he went on, referring to Kneissl. “It is one aspect of the Jewish character of this wonderful democracy to not give a hechsher [kosher stamp] to a party like the FPOe.”

News article:
YERUSHALAYIM (Reuters) — Hungarian leader Viktor Orban urged Poland and Israel on Tuesday to resolve their dispute over accusations of Polish complicity in the Holocaust, making the appeal in Jerusalem after Warsaw pulled out of a planned Israeli-hosted summit. The Hungarian prime minister and counterparts from Slovakia and the Czech Republic held back-to-back talks with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in lieu of the formal gathering of the central European Visegrad Group (V-4) of countries that also includes Poland. Poland withdrew from the summit after Israel’s Acting Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz said on Monday that “many Poles” had collaborated with the Nazis in World War II and shared responsibility for the Holocaust. “I think it would be better that they would be here, and we have good friendship with Poland, as you know … and we have good friendship with Israel,” Orban, asked by a reporter if he was disappointed by Poland’s absence, said after meeting Netanyahu. “When you have two friends having discussions with each other the only hope you can have is that they will talk directly with each other and improve the situation. That’s my hope also.” Netanyahu, who was standing at the podium with Orban when the question was asked, did not respond directly, saying only that the Hungarian leader was a “superb diplomat.” The diplomatic row has been escalating since Friday, when some Israeli media reported remarks by Netanyahu in which he appeared to accuse the Polish nation of involvement in the Holocaust. Netanyahu’s office said he had been misquoted in his response to a reporter’s question during a visit to Warsaw about Polish legislation related to Holocaust remembrance, and that he had not cast any blanket blame. Many Poles refuse to accept research showing thousands of their countrymen participated in the Holocaust in addition to thousands of others who risked their lives to help the Jews. Tensions between Israel and Poland also rose last year after Poland introduced new legislation that would have made the use of phrases such as “Polish death camps” punishable by up to three years in prison. After pressure from the United States and an outcry in Israel, Poland watered down the legislation, scrapping the prison sentences.

News article:
Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein defends his fellow Likud party member, acting foreign minister Israel Katz, over remarks that have infuriated Poland. Speaking at an annual event organized by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Edelstein says it is “the right of every senior Israeli official to tell the truth. For me, this is an example for the fragile relations between the countries.” Katz said in media interviews earlier this week that Poles “suckle anti-Semitism with their mothers’ milk,” leading to Poland pulling out of a summit due to take place in Jerusalem this week and dressing down Israel’s ambassador Anna Azari. Poland is demanding an apology from Israel, threatening that relations could take a “frosty turn.”

News article:
VIENNA, Feb 20 (Reuters) - A group representing Austrian Holocaust survivors voiced outrage on Wednesday over staffing shortages in a government department dealing with Nazi-related crimes, calling on Chancellor Sebastian Kurz to take action. Kurz, a conservative governing in coalition with a far-right party founded by ex-Nazis, has repeatedly denounced anti-Semitism and the Holocaust since taking office just over a year ago. His government has pledged to offer citizenship to the descendants of Austrians who fled the country under Nazi rule. But a department at the main domestic intelligence agency that handles reports of Nazi-related crimes is understaffed to the point of having a large backlog, according to the Mauthausen Committee, which represents survivors of Austria's biggest Nazi-era concentration camp. "The government - and in particular the chancellor - stresses at every opportunity that everything is being done to fight neo-Nazism and anti-Semitism effectively," the committee said in a statement. "In fact the Nazism-reporting department is being denied the necessary staff, to the point that it has a backlog of hundreds of pieces of evidence and some far-right crimes are falling under statutes of limitations," it said, adding that it mainly gets no reply when it passes on information to the department. The far-right Freedom Party controls much of Austria's security apparatus including the Interior Ministry, to which the main domestic intelligence agency belongs. "Chancellor Kurz is responsible for ensuring that Interior Minister (Herbert) Kickl no longer hinders the fight against neo-Nazism and anti-Semitism. One can only hope that there is no political intent behind this hindrance," the committee said. In Austria, which was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, it is a crime to deny the Holocaust or give the Hitler salute. As in several other European countries, cases of anti-Semitism appear to be on the rise. The leader of Austria's main Jewish organisation also says the far-right Freedom Party that is in power has failed to tackle anti-Semitism within its ranks, even after scandals involving party officials. Israel refuses to deal directly with Freedom Party ministers even though the party says it has turned its back on its Nazi past, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised Kurz for saying Israel's security is a major priority.

The U.S. Ambassador to Poland Georgette Mosbacher called on Israel to apologize to Poland for Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz’s comments regarding the Holocaust. Mosbacher said that Katz should apologize, responding that what he said “warrants an apology.” Katz told Israel’s i24 news channel on Sunday, “I am the son of Holocaust survivors, we will never forgive and never forget, and there were many Poles who collaborated with the Nazis.” Quoting former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Katz added that “Shamir said that every Pole sucked anti-Semitism with his mother’s milk. Nobody will tell us how to express our stance and how to honor the dead.” The remarks were made after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the recent Warsaw summit on the Mideast that Poles cooperated with Nazis during the Holocaust, and that no one has been sued for asserting this truth, criticizing Poland’s Holocaust Law, which forbids accusing Poland of complicity with the Nazis under penalty of law.

News article:
By Alan Charlish WARSAW (Reuters) - Washington's ambassador to Warsaw on Wednesday called on Israel to apologize to Poland in a row between the two countries over the Holocaust, after Israel's acting foreign minister said "many Poles" had collaborated with the Nazis. The row, initially sparked by media reports suggesting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Poles of complicity in the Holocaust, deepened on Monday after the comment by his minister Israel Katz, who also labeled Poles anti-Semites. Katz's words led Poland to pull out of a planned summit of central European states in Israel. U.S. ambassador Georgette Mosbacher, asked if Katz should apologize, said the comment "warrants an apology". Mosbacher said she felt two strong allies like Israel and Poland "shouldn't be using that kind of rhetoric. We are too important to each other not to work these things out." Poland was home to one of the largest Jewish communities before World War Two, but more than 3 million Polish Jews died in the Holocaust. Many Poles still refuse to accept research showing thousands participated in the Holocaust in addition to the thousands who risked their lives to help the Jews. Katz is a member of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party which presently leads the polls ahead of national elections scheduled for April. Netanyahu, whose office said his initial comments had been misinterpreted, has faced criticism in Israel over what some see as a bid to win allies in central Europe at the expense of revising Holocaust history and whitewashing anti-Semitism. He had also hoped the Visegrad summit that was boycotted by Poland would burnish his diplomatic credentials as the election campaign picks up. Netanyahu's office said in a statement that the prime minister, who was in Warsaw for a U.S.-sponsored Middle East conference, had been misquoted by The Jerusalem Post, which issued a corrected story. Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely, also a member of Netanyahu's Likud, said on Wednesday there were Poles who cooperated with the Nazis and Poles who saved Jews. "The entire Polish nation cannot be blamed for the Holocaust," he said in an interview with Reshet Beit Radio. "Poland is one of the friendliest countries to Israel... The understandings between us and Poland still stand." (Reporting in WARSAW by Alan Charlish and in JERUSALEM by Maayan Lubell; Writing by Marcin Goclowski; editing by John Stonestreet)

News article:
WARSAW, Poland (AP) - The Israeli government said Friday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was misquoted by a newspaper on the extremely sensitive issue of Polish behavior during the Holocaust, seeking to defuse a diplomatic crisis. However, the Polish government said it considered that response insufficient and expects a clearer explanation. Netanyahu said a day earlier during a visit to Warsaw that "Poles cooperated with the Nazis" - wording suggesting that some Poles during the German occupation of Poland took part in killing Jews. However, the Jerusalem Post quoted him as saying "the Poles," which could be taken as blaming the entire Polish nation. The matter threatened to spark another major spat between the two countries, which clashed last year over a new Polish law that made it illegal to blame the Polish nation for collaboration in the Holocaust. Poland has even threatened to withdraw from a meeting of Central European leaders that is to take place next week in Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacts during a bilateral meeting with United States Vice President Mike Pence in Warsaw, Poland, Thursday, Feb. 14, 2019. The Polish capital is host for a two-day international conference on the Middle East, co-organized by Poland and the United States. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn) Netanyahu was clearly eager to avoid another potential crisis. "The Prime Minister's comments concerning Poland were misquoted by the Jerusalem Post, which quickly issued a correction clarifying that an error had been made in the editing of the article," Netanyahu's office said in a statement. The Polish Foreign Ministry summoned the Israeli ambassador for an explanation. But a deputy foreign minister, Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek, said the explanations given by Israel so far are "unclear" and that Warsaw is still awaiting a clarification that would leave it without any doubts. Poland has expressed an "expectation that the Israeli side will say in a clear way what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meant when he said the words that were quoted by the Israeli media," Szynkowski vel Sek said. He added, though, that this did not impact on the leaders' upcoming meeting slated to start Monday in Jerusalem, where Netanyahu hopes to strengthen Israel's political and economic ties with central Europe, a region that is a strong supporter of Israel. Later, Netanyahu's office weighed in with another statement, saying: "Netanyahu spoke of Poles and not the Polish people or the country of Poland. This was misquoted and misrepresented in press reports and was subsequently corrected by the journalist who issued the initial misstatement." The Holocaust is still an extremely sensitive subject in Poland, even nearly 80 years after World War II. Nazi Germany subjected the country to a brutal occupation, killing nearly 6 million citizens, about 3 million of them Jewish, but almost as many of them Christian Poles. Poland had an underground resistance movement that fought the Germans and more than 6,800 Poles have been recognized by Yad Vashem, the Israeli Holocaust memorial, for helping Jews at risk to their own lives, more than from any other country. However, there was anti-Semitism in Poland before the war and some Poles welcomed the removal of the large Jewish population from their society, while some blackmailed Jews or participated in the killings. Emotional debates rage to this day over how to characterize the Polish responses to the murder of Jews on their soil.

News article:
By Joanna Plucinska WARSAW, March 14 (Reuters) - A news kiosk inside Poland's parliament was found to be selling a newspaper with an article instructing readers on "How to recognise a Jew", drawing accusations that lawmakers were happy to tolerate anti-Semitism. The article in "Tylko Polska" ("Only Poland"), a low-circulation, nationally distributed right-wing weekly, describes how to recognise Jews based on their last names, personality traits and facial features. Jewish women, it says, "lack the delicacy, modesty and sense of shame that are innate to Polish women." It goes on: "Because the whole world belongs to them ... they are supposed to exist in every country, take power over nations and lead to the creation of one worldwide Jewish state." Pictures of the paper on sale at a newspaper kiosk in parliament, in a country where more than 3 million of a population of 3.2 million Jews were murdered by in the Holocaust, were widely shared on social media. Parliament said it would request the publication be withdrawn from sale, but a Jewish groups demanded stronger action. "The lack of clear condemnation of the incident on the part of key Polish politicians, such as the speaker of the Sejm (parliament), is disturbing," said Agnieszka Markiewicz, director of the American Jewish Committee for Central Europe. Some politicians did react. "It's an absolute scandal that, in the Polish parliament, such pitiful papers that look as if they are taken from Nazi publications, are sold," said Michal Kaminski, a member of parliament for the leftwing opposition Polish Peasants Party. Krzysztof Brejza, a member for the centre-right opposition Civic Platform, said the publication was a symptom of intolerance promoted by the ruling conservative Law and Justice Party (PiS) led by former prime minister Jarosław Kaczyński. "The promotion of hatred in society serves Jarosław Kaczyński. It is disgusting that in the temple of democracy, in the Polish parliament, such materials are displayed," Brejza said. A spokesperson for PiS was not immediately available to comment. The Polish government has bristled at suggestions of anti-Semitism in the past. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki cancelled a trip to Jerusalem last month after Israel's foreign minister said many Poles "suckle anti-Semitism with their mothers' milk" and had collaborated with Nazis in the Holocaust. Israel also opposed a law passed last year which made it a criminal offence to use phrases such as "Polish death camps" to refer to the Nazi-run concentration camps on Polish soil, including Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor, where millions of Jews were killed.

Warsaw seeks to maintain dialogue with Israel but only with politicians and organizations able of talking “constructively,” a top Polish diplomat has said, referring to fallout from remarks by the Israeli interim foreign minister. “There’s no conflict out there, as it means a quarrel between two sides. We have a statement by a single politician, which compromises himself, first of all, yet, undoubtedly, complicates our relationship,” Poland’s Deputy Foreign Minister Szymon Szynkowski said at a press conference on Wednesday. Warsaw will only engage in dialogue with those Jewish organizations and politicians who are supportive towards Poland, while ignoring those, who make “insulting remarks,” he added. Late in February, Israeli interim Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz had quoted former Israeli PM Yitzhak Shamir and said that “Every Pole suckled anti-Semitism with his mother's milk,” triggering a major row between the two countries. Also on rt.com Warsaw won’t bow to ‘lies & racist insults,’ Polish PM says amid simmering row with Israel Diplomatic relations between Warsaw and Tel Aviv have been quite strained recently, damaged by a controversial law adopted last year in Poland. The legislation bans phrases like “Polish SS,” “Polish death camps” and so on, prohibiting any implication that the Polish state and the Poles had been fully complicit in Nazi mass murders there during WWII. The legislation had initially provided for up to three years behind bars for persons convicted of this behavior, yet it was watered down later, and now pointing to the role played by the Poles in the Holocaust is merely a civil offence, punishable by a fine. While the diplomatic spat appeared to be over, it was reignited this February by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who yet again accused the Poles of “collaborating with Nazis” and condemned the “whitewashing” of history. Netanyahu's remark was swiftly echoed by Katz, who ultimately managed to make it worse. Katz’s comment caused an uproar in Poland, with Foreign Minister Marek Magierowski calling it “shameful and racist” and demanding an apology. As Tel Aviv did not apologize, Poland dropped out of the Visegrad 4 summit, hosted by Israel. Warsaw's move then ultimately led to the cancelation of the whole event. To try and fix the attempts to “distort history” and accuse the Poles of contributing to the Nazi crimes of the WWII era, the Foreign Ministry has issued a booklet, dubbed “How it was in reality,” Szynkowski revealed. The booklet, printed in English, German and Polish, is based on interviews with the survivors of Nazi death camps. “The booklets have been sent to countries where the problem [of history distortion] emerges the most often: to the US, the UK, Germany and Canada,” the diplomat said.

EU Stance on Caracas Too Biased for Comprehensive Talks - Venezuelan Envoy Sputnik News 23:18 31.01.2019(updated 00:05 01.02.2019) BRUSSELS (Sputnik) - Positions expressed by EU officials regarding the events in Venezuela were not neutral enough to allow the European Union to participate as a full-fledged mediator in political dialogue, the country's ambassador to Brussels, Claudia Salerno Caldera, told Sputnik on Thursday. "After the attempted coup in Venezuela, and taking into account the fact that the EU countries are now divided between those who support it and those who do not recognize this attempt, still considering Maduro as the only president, and also taking into account some radical positions, which were voiced by a number of these countries, I do not think that they are now neutral enough to be involved [in the mediation process]", the ambassador said. From the very beginning, EU officials clearly stated that they do not want to act as a mediator, but wanted to help dialogue, she added. "It has been their position since last year," Caldera said, recalling EU initiative to create a contact group. Fortunately, there are European countries supporting peace efforts, she said. "There are those who follow Trump's position, and there are those countries that are taking the position of peace. Currently, the EU as a whole does not have a unified position on Venezuela. They are still conducting consultations, in particular, they are discussing this at the ministerial meeting today", the ambassador said. Caldera noted that she had conducted a number of meetings to discuss the Venezuelan crisis in Brussels. "We worked intensively with various EU countries, but also with colleagues in the region who expressed their interest in promoting various decisions regarding our country", she said, answering whether Venezuelan diplomats had succeeded in conveying to EU officials the position on the unacceptability of an ultimatum previously put forward by a number of countries. According to the ambassador, the whole world is now clearly divided between those joining the US position favoring military intervention and support of the current coup and those who oppose this approach and call for creating the conditions for resuming dialogue. "Diplomacy and dialogue are the only ways to resolve the current situation in Venezuela", she said. She expressed hope that, given the recent events, the EU countries would change their positions and move toward supporting peace. Earlier in the day, the European Parliament voted 439-104 for a non-binding resolution that recognized the self-proclaimed president Juan Guaido and urged the EU external action service to follow suit. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro told Sputnik Tuesday that he was ready to sit at the negotiating table with the opposition with the participation of international mediators. On Wednesday, an EU source told Sputnik that Brussels was ready to support the political process in Venezuela by creating an international contact group, and is now consulting with partners on this issue. At the same time, the European Commissioner for Crisis Response Christos Stylianides told the European Parliament that such a contact group was not intended to conduct a direct dialogue between the conflicting parties in Venezuela. Venezuela is currently going through a severe political crisis, with Juan Guaido, the head of the opposition-controlled Venezuelan National Assembly, having proclaimed himself the country's interim president on 23 January. The United States and its several allies have instantly recognized Guaido. Some of the EU countries, including the UK, Germany, France, and Spain declared on Saturday their intention to recognise Juan Guaido as the country's interim president if Caracas does not announce snap presidential elections within eight days. President Maduro himself called Venezuela "the victim of a US conspiracy", referring to US Vice President Mike Pence promising Guaido "full American support" the day before he declared himself Venezuela's new head of state. Maduro also stressed that Venezuela had held legitimate elections and urged European countries to withdraw their demand. Constitutionally elected Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro accused Washington of orchestrating a coup in the country. Russia, China, Mexico, Uruguay, Iran and Turkey among other countries, have voiced support for Maduro as the only legitimate president of Venezuela. © Sputnik NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
Members of the European Union will officially recognize Juan Guaido as Venezuela's interim president next week. Earlier this week, the bloc's foreign ministers agreed to back Guaido's decision to declare himself president but will do so only until a new election is held. According to Reuters, the ministers are mindful the decision to back Venezuela's interim president could set a dangerous political precedent and will proceed cautiously. Each of the 28 members state will outline its position over the new head of Venezuela's National Assembly, as opposed to the EU making a joint declaration. Last month, Guaido declared himself the country's "acting president", a move which was recognized by the U.S, but dismissed by Nicolás Maduro, who has held office since 2013. Maduro was sworn in for a second term in January, a result which was disputed by several governments, including the U.S. Along with Washington, Canada, Australia, Georgia, Haiti, Israel, Kosovo and Morocco have all formally recognized Guaido. Britain, Germany, France and Spain will formally back Guaido on Monday. Smaller EU members, however, will adopt a more cautious approach, specifically avoiding to use words such as "recognition" in their statements. "A lot of countries will want to stress the interim nature of this de-facto recognition," an EU diplomat was quoted as saying by Reuters. The EU's position is further complicated by the fact the European Parliament on Thursday recognized the 35-year-old Guaido as the head of the Venezuelan congress. According to the report, the 28-country bloc based its decision on the Venezuelan constitution, which states the head of congress can take over if the president is absent, incapacitated or usurps power. Guaido's allies have long argued that Maduro stole the second mandate in January. Last Saturday, the EU set a eight-day deadline for a new election, which Maduro dismissed as an unacceptable ultimatum. Despite Guaido's attempt to oust him, Maduro retains the support of a host of allies in the region, including Bolivia, Cuba, El Salvador and Nicaragua, as well as Dominica, Suriname, Saint Kitts, Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean. Belarus, China, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Greece, Iran, Laos, North Korea and the Palestinian government have also declared their support for him, as have Russia, South Africa, Syria and Turkey. Uruguay and Mexico, meanwhile, continue to recognize Maduro but plan to hold a meeting to resolve the situation. Similarly, the EU has offered to lead an international delegation containing emissaries from 10 to 12 countries in a bid to solve the political impasse in Venezuela. The International Contact Group on Venezuela will meet in Montevideo, Uruguay next week. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the group will include the governments of Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Italy, as well as Bolivia and Ecuador.

News article:
The Trump administration Tuesday forged ahead in what one analyst called "a complicated chess game" of handing more of Venezuela's assets in the United States over to its interim president, seeking to tighten the economic stranglehold on the embattled government of Nicolás Maduro. Washington worked furiously this week to isolate Maduro and allow National Assembly leader Juan Guaidó, internationally recognized by the US and its allies as the interim president of Venezuela, to control the nation's vital oil trade that supplies nearly 6,000 US gas stations under the Citgo brand. The State Department certified that Guaidó has authority to control all Venezuelan government bank accounts in the US financial system, giving him access to any cash or gold Venezuela may be holding in US banks. President Donald Trump takes US intelligence officials to task, disputing their assessments on Iran and other global threats. According to him, "The Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran. They are wrong! They are testing Rockets (last week) and more, and are coming very close to the edge. Their economy is now crashing, which is the only thing holding them back. Be careful of Iran… Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school!" Mainstream corporate media is painting this as Trump going off the rails again; how can he challenge the leaders of the intelligence apparatus in this country? Who's right and who's wrong here? Oh, if the leaders of the intelligence apparatus in this country are infallible, where are the weapons of mass destruction? GUESTS: Colin Campbell — PhD student in the Department of Communication, Culture and Media Studies at Howard University's School of Communication. He has been a TV news reporter for more than 20 years. As a senior Washington, DC, correspondent since 2008, he has been a reporter-at-large, covering two presidencies, Congress and the State Department. Caleb Maupin — Journalist and political analyst who focuses his coverage on US foreign policy and the global system of monopoly capitalism and imperialism.

TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s official IRNA news agency said Saturday that President Hassan Rouhani has expressed his support for embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. According to IRNA, Rouhani met with the Venezuelan envoy to Tehran, Carlos Alcala Cordones, and voiced his support for Maduro’s government. “We believe the people of Venezuela though unity and standing by the government will defuse the pressures by Washington,” Rouhani is quoted as saying. Rouhani describes what he termed as US intervention in Venezuela’s internal affairs as “very ugly.” “Americans basically oppose popular revolution and independent nations,” Rouhani said, according to the report.

Both countries are members of OPEC and have had numerous economic agreements. Despite support from governments including Iran, Russia, China, Turkey, Belarus, Bolivia, as well as the Palestinian Authority, momentum is growing for Venezuela’s opposition movement led by lawmaker Juan Guaido. Advertisement Guaido declared himself interim president last week before tens of thousands of cheering supporters and vowed to end Maduro’s “dictatorship.” His claim to the presidency is backed by the United States and some two dozen other nations, including Israel, Canada, the EU, Australia and most of Latin America. US President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, tweeted Thursday that Maduro and his top advisers should retire to “a nice beach somewhere far away from Venezuela.” Bolton’s talk turned tougher Friday in an interview with conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt in which he warned that it could be a beach area more like Guantanamo. Maduro remains dug in, blaming the White House for openly backing what he calls a coup to remove him from power and exploit his country’s vast oil wealth. He retains support from powerful allies, but is growing increasingly isolated as more nations back Guaido. Maduro on Friday continued a show of might as commander-in-chief that has seen him crisscross Venezuela to oversee military exercises as he vows to defend his socialist government no matter the cost. The military’s top leadership is backing Maduro, though analysts warn that rank-and-file troops frustrated by their country’s economic and humanitarian crisis may not share that unwavering loyalty. The opposition’s street protests planned for Saturday are the second such mass action this week. Guaido led a peaceful demonstration Wednesday with residents stepping out of their homes and workplaces for two hours. Last week, street protests turned violent in days of unrest that killed nearly three dozen people in clashes with government security forces. Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.

Bolivian President Expresses Support for Maduro During Meeting in Venezuela Sputnik News 05:45 02.02.2019(updated 05:46 02.02.2019) MEXICO CITY (Sputnik) – Bolivian President Evo Morales said he had arrived in Venezuela to meet with his counterpart Nicolas Maduro and express support for the Venezuelan president amid a political crisis in the country. "We are meeting with my fellow President of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro and expressing all our support to him in the face of the overthrow and intervention by the empire that wants to appropriate Venezuela's national wealth in violation of international law. Bolivia supports dialogue aimed at avoiding conflicts," Morales wrote on Twitter. The Bolivian president also published a photo taken during his meeting with Maduro. Venezuela is currently facing large-scale anti-government protests with opposition leader Juan Guaido having declared himself the country's interim president in a bid to ouster Maduro. Moreover, the United States, which has supported Guaido, has seized millions of worth of assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil and gas company PDVSA. In response, Maduro called Guaido a puppet of Washington, accusing the United States of plotting to overthrow him.

Bolivian President Expresses Support for Maduro During Meeting in Venezuela Sputnik News 05:45 02.02.2019(updated 05:46 02.02.2019) MEXICO CITY (Sputnik) – Bolivian President Evo Morales said he had arrived in Venezuela to meet with his counterpart Nicolas Maduro and express support for the Venezuelan president amid a political crisis in the country. "We are meeting with my fellow President of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro and expressing all our support to him in the face of the overthrow and intervention by the empire that wants to appropriate Venezuela's national wealth in violation of international law. Bolivia supports dialogue aimed at avoiding conflicts," Morales wrote on Twitter. The Bolivian president also published a photo taken during his meeting with Maduro. Venezuela is currently facing large-scale anti-government protests with opposition leader Juan Guaido having declared himself the country's interim president in a bid to ouster Maduro. Moreover, the United States, which has supported Guaido, has seized millions of worth of assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil and gas company PDVSA. In response, Maduro called Guaido a puppet of Washington, accusing the United States of plotting to overthrow him. Russia, China, Mexico, Uruguay, Iran and Turkey among other countries, have voiced support for Maduro as the only legitimate president of Venezuela. Mexico and Uruguay are planning to convene a conference on Venezuela on 7 February in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo to lay the foundation for the creation of a new dialogue mechanism that would contribute to the return of stability and peace in the country.

French President Emmanuel Macron says he recognizes opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president of Venezuela and urges him to hold a new presidential election shortly. Macron also declares that Venezuelans “have the right to express themselves freely and democratically.” Moments after Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian said France is recognizing Guaido, Macron posts a message on Twitter to express his support for the head of the Venezuelan congress. At least eight other European nations have done the same after current Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro defied their call to resign and hold a new vote. Sweden said the vote that brought Maduro to power was not free or fair. — AP

The only way this works with a US population weary of two straight decades of war is for things to get so bad our intervention makes us look like the savior of a blighted people. then it never will. Then he followed that up by saying exactly that . The most welcome news for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in the past month came from Russian President Vladimir Putin in December. Maduro and Putin reaffirmed the relationship between the two countries with more than just words.More than $5 billion in new oil exploration and production deals were signed when the two met in DecemberMaduro has insisted that the Venezuelan state oil company PVDSA will only accept Petro for its oil starting this year. By all accounts the Petro looks like a scam and until he can make good on promises to his benefactors, Russia and China, there is no way they will use it.But, in theory, the Petro is a fine idea. Is it one that Maduro can pull off? It's a good question. I doubt it.But if it, or something like it were to succeed, it represents a tectonic shift for the world economy. Not today or tomorrow, mind you, but over time. Why? Because it provides a blueprint for countries which are not on The Davos Crowd's Christmas card list to extricate themselves from the IMF/World Bank/SWIFT hamster wheel of currency collapse, debt slavery, economic privation and regime change.Because cryptocurrencies exist outside of the traditional banking system it allows them to skirt sanctions (which are acts of war) and continue engaging in peaceful commerce on their terms, not those set on Wall St. or K Street.But that said, there's no real need for the Petro per se. Maduro could simply take Bitcoin.The other day I wrote an article tying US policy towards Venezuela to Iran, saying Trump's plans for Energy Dominance are what is driving his foreign policyAnd its John Bolton who is the architect of this horrific policy.I told you this last summer when it was Turkey's lira that was the big story.And before that it was the Saudis' attempt to overthrow the government of Qatar through financial and military blockade.And in late 2014 it was the collapse in oil prices which was supposed to spark a revolt against Putin in Russia which also failed, despite rumors of an internal coup within the Kremlin suppressed by Putin in March 2015.Every day past the big news day, the crisis day, that the target of that crisis survives raises the odds of the situation improving as the panic subsides, information is disseminated, markets calmed over and allies respond.Opposition to our meddling in Caracas will harden, Maduro's position will strengthen and things will calm down.It will be up to Maduro then to get serious about making things right in his country. Again, I'm not sure he's capable of it butThe only silver lining to all of this is that Trump can then blame Bolton and Pompeo for this sad state of affairs, fire them for incompetence and begin dismantling the policy towards Iran. But, I'm probably just engaging in a bit of wishful thinking here.Over the past two years Venezuelan oil production has collapsed by nearly 30% from over 2.1 million barrels per day to under 1.5 million late last year. Production numbers have recovered slightly and were back above 1.5 million in December.But the reality is that those lost barrels are the difference between a stable government and one on the brink of collapse. The focus for Putin and China's Xi Jinping now should be on getting those numbers back up to 2017 levels quickly and bringing some semblance of normalcy to the situation there.And this is, frankly, heartless treatment of the very Venezuelan people the lesser lights of the Trump administration profess to care so much about. Our policy towards them has been nothing more than a variation on the old adage, "the beatings will continue until morale improves."In this case, substitute removing Maduro from power for 'morale' and regaining access to the global banking system the 'beatings.'But it is absolutely no different than the rhetoric used by both Pompeo and Bolton over Iran. Remember Pompeo's list of 12 demands on Iran last year? This is a clear statement to the Iranian government,Humans would rather starve to death than be saved by megalomaniacs like Bolton, Pompeo and Trump. Our dignity demands more from us than that. What is the saddest part of this is that the Trump base has been sold this policy as some kind of humanitarian mission to save the Venezuelans from Maduro.That groundwork has already been laid about Iran.When the reality is that it's the US' needs to starve the world of oil to maintain the petrodollar system that they need to be saved from.

News article:
Venezuela’s self-proclaimed interim president, Juan Guaido, coordinates his every step with a foreign country and Moscow sees no point in communicating with a dependent figure, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. When Guaido declared himself the interim president of Venezuela in late January, Moscow slammed the actions of the speaker of the opposition-dominated National Assembly as “an attempt to usurp power.” It insisted that no one but democratically-elected president Nicolas Maduro could be the legitimate leader of the country. The latest comment comes from the head of the Foreign Ministry’s Latin American Department, Alexander Schetinin, and it’s the first time that Russia has directly spoken out about the poster-boy of the attempted coup in Venezuela. Our analysis of the situation indicates that Guaido is an absolutely non-independent politician. “He coordinates his every step and receives a blessing for it from another country. Due to this fact, we don’t see any point in communicating with him,” Schetinin pointed out. He didn’t specify what he meant by “another country,” but Guaido’s claim to power was vigorously supported by Washington, which swiftly declared him a legitimate interim president. UK, France, Spain, and several other EU states followed the US example, but the opposition leader still lacks a bloc-wide endorsement, due to Italy’s stance. Russia denounced the move as “direct interference” in Venezuela’s internal affairs. Guaido was also rejected by China, Iran, and Turkey. Despite making headlines worldwide, Guaido is a relatively new face on Venezuela’s political landscape. Many Venezuelans say they first heard of him when he declared himself president, while some of the foreign leaders, who endorse the man, are unable to pronounce his name correctly. Media reports suggest that long-time opposition figure, with strong links to the US, Leopoldo Lopez, is the real mastermind here, despite remaining under house arrest in Caracas for provoking deadly clashes at an anti-government protest a few years ago. Also on rt.com From zero to hero: How Venezuelan opposition leader Lopez made Juan Guaido the man of the day Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

Dujarric also called for "serious political negotiations" to resolve the crisis in Venezuela.

News article:
Venezuelan Opposition to Get Money From US Fund Filled With Oil Money - Report Sputnik News 13:41 07.02.2019 Washington earlier imposed sanctions against Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA and passed control over some of its foreign funds held by US-insured banks to Juan Guaido, a leader of the opposition, who proclaimed himself interim president of Venezuela. The Venezuelan opposition will be getting money from a US-based fund that will accrue some of the country's oil income, Reuters reported, citing opposition lawmaker Carlos Paparoni. The fund will be reportedly filled with the profits from PDVSA's American subsidiary, Citgo starting from last month. Paparoni has refused to give details about the future fund, but added that its creation will likely be announced next week by the opposition's representative in the US. Citgo is one of the largest US-based refineries and Venezuela's biggest foreign asset, which has found itself in the middle of a conflict between Caracas and Washington, as it is formally controlled by Venezuela's PDVSA, but operates on US soil. The move to create the fund, which will bankroll the Venezuelan opposition, comes in the wake of US calls for Nicolas Maduro to step down and recognition of self-proclaimed interim President of Venezuela – Juan Guaido. In a bid to cut Maduro's earnings, Washington has sanctioned major state-owned oil-producer PDVSA and frozen its foreign assets. The US passed control over some of these assets to Guaido and his team. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has accused Washington of orchestrating a coup and severed diplomatic ties with the country. He is currently supported as the only legitimate president by Russia, China, Iran, Turkey and several other nations. The US, Canada, Israel, and over a dozen South American countries have recognised Guaido as the interim president. Most EU states have supported him as well, with the notable exception being Italy. © Sputnik NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
Military invasion among US options against Venezuela government: Russia Iran Press TV Fri Feb 8, 2019 02:51AM Russia has warned that the United States is considering a range of options against the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, including a direct military invasion of the Latin American country, which has been engulfed in political unrest over the past weeks. "There are still signs coming from Washington about the possibility of using force in order to overthrow the legal authorities, including through direct military invasion," Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said at a weekly briefing in Moscow on Thursday. "This is actually being spoken about openly in the White House." Tens of thousands of Venezuelans have thronged the streets of Venezuela, holding rallies in support and against Maduro, who began his second six-year term in office last month. The clashes began after Juan Guaido, the opposition leader in the country's National Assembly, proclaimed himself as "interim president" and urged Maduro to resign. The US rushed to support Guaido, announcing sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry. Other US officials have also doubled down on the possibility of military action, reiterating President Donald Trump's stance that "all options are on the table." In an interview with CBS on Sunday, Trump said military action against Maduro remained "an option." Zakharova said Thursday that Washington had already made up its mind about a military action and "everything else is nothing more than a covering operation." The Russian diplomat said such threats violated the Charter of the United Nations. She criticized American officials for threatening Caracas with more economic sanctions while calling on the military to defect the legal government of Maduro. "Washington has turned to direct threats of sanctions to the Venezuelan military, which remains loyal to the legitimate government. That is just a different, new reading of the 'carrot and stick' approach. On the one hand, they threaten a potential punishment. On the other hand, they promise a potential reward", Zakharova noted. "I would like to recall that this kind of statement from the mouth of American officials is a direct violation of Article 2 Par. 4 of the UN Charter, ordering all UN members to refrain from the threat or use of force in international relations", she said at the briefing. On Wednesday, US National Security Adviser John Bolton said Washington was ready to exempt Venezuelan military commanders from sanctions if they joined Guaido. Earlier, he had called on Venezuela's military forces and other government officials to use Guaido's "amnesty" and pledge allegiance to him. Guaido has been in talks with military officials in Venezuela to convince them to defect. He has published an open letter, calling on the military to withdraw their support from Maduro. Venezuelan authorities said Wednesday they had seized a large shipment of US-made weapons aboard a cargo plane that had taken off from Miami, Florida. EU, LatAm countries call for peaceful resolution of crisis On Thursday, ministers from over a dozen European and Latin American countries called for "free, transparent and credible presidential elections" in Venezuela to resolve the ongoing crisis. The International Contact Group (GCI) said all sides needed to find a "peaceful, democratic" way out of the situation "without the use of force." Besides the US, other major Western powers such as the UK, France, Spain and Germany have recognized Guaido as president. Russia, China, Iran and Turkey are some of the countries that have thrown their support behind Maduro. NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
After self-proclaimed leader of Venezuela Juan Guaido said he might 'authorize' a US military intervention, he was rebuffed by Congressman Ro Khanna, who told him he doesn’t get to make the call on "US military interventions." “Mr. Guaido, you can proclaim yourself leader of Venezuela but you don’t get to authorize US military interventions,” Khanna tweeted on Saturday, adding that only the US Congress can greenlight sending troops overseas. “We will not,” the Democrat from California added. Mr. Guaido, you can proclaim yourself leader of Venezuela but you don’t get to authorize US military interventions. Only the US Congress can do that. We will not. https://t.co/rbPldFOnOZ — Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) 9 февраля 2019 г. He further stressed that it is not up to “neoconservative Defense Department officials” or “defense contractor lobbyists” to authorize interventions abroad either. Congressman Khanna was reacting to earlier remarks made by US-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido, who didn’t rule out approving a US military intervention to oust President Nicolas Maduro from power in Venezuela. He told AFP that he would do “everything that is necessary” in order to “save human lives,” while acknowledging that the deployment of American soldiers is “a very controversial subject.” The speaker of the nation’s parliament, Juan Guaido, declared himself ‘interim president’ of Venezuela in January. His move was immediately supported by the White House. Most South American states and some EU nations, such as the UK, France, and Germany, followed suit. Recognizing Guaido as the legitimate leader of the nation, US President Donald Trump confirmed that direct military involvement in Venezuela is “an option.” His position was later echoed by Vice President Mike Pence, who reiterated that Washington will “keep all options on the table” until democracy is “restored” in Caracas. The Trump administration’s belligerent rhetoric was met with pushback from a number of politicians. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said the US must “not be in the business of regime change or supporting coups.” Representative Ilhan Omar noted that a US-backed coup is “not a solution” to Venezuela’s problems and Washington “cannot hand pick leaders for other countries.” “Let the Venezuelan people determine their future,” Congresswoman from Hawaii Tulsi Gabbard wrote, saying the US should “stay out.” The United States needs to stay out of Venezuela. Let the Venezuelan people determine their future. We don't want other countries to choose our leaders--so we have to stop trying to choose theirs. — Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) 24 января 2019 г. Nations such as Russia, China, and Iran continue to recognize Nicolas Maduro as the legitimate president of Venezuela. The US’ open backing of the opposition is aimed at “exacerbating the division within the Venezuelan society,” which can lead to “chaos” and the “destruction of Venezuelan statehood,” the Russian Foreign Ministry has stated. A spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry noted that “enduring peace” in Venezuela can only be achieved through dialogue and “political means.” President Maduro told RT Spanish that the US made a “mistake” by getting behind the opposition. He said that he doesn’t believe a foreign intervention will actually take place, but the country has to be prepared, nonetheless. The government needs to ensure that military involvement would cost Washington “entirely too much.” Maduro earlier warned that a conflict would be a ‘David v Goliath’ situation, leaving Trump’s presidency “stained with blood.” Like this story?

News article:
Hezbollah should not be allowed to benefit from Venezuela crisis Dr. Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro. (AP Photo) US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that Hezbollah “has active cells” in Venezuela, adding that it and Iran are “impacting the people of Venezuela and throughout South America. We have an obligation to take down that risk for America.” Some observers dismissed Pompeo’s remarks as an escalation in the war of words between the US and Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro — rhetoric without basis in reality. In 2017, when Pompeo was still CIA director, he also warned that Iran and Hezbollah’s growing presence in Venezuela posed a serious threat to the US. In February of that year, the US sanctioned Venezuela’s then-Vice President Tareck El-Aissami for his links with Hezbollah and drug trafficking. El-Aissami has been Venezuela’s Minister of Industries and National Production since June last year. He had served previously as minister of the interior and justice from 2008 to 2012, governor of Aragua from 2012 to 2017, and vice president of Venezuela from 2017 to 2018, when he was sanctioned. In June last year, the US Treasury Department designated two Venezuelan-based supporters of Hezbollah, Ghazi Nasr Al-Din and Fawzi Kan’an, along with two travel agencies owned and controlled by Kan’an. At the time, Adam J. Szubin, Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control at the Treasury, lamented that: “It is extremely troubling to see the government of Venezuela employing and providing safe harbor to Hezbollah facilitators and fundraisers.” He vowed to “continue to expose the global nature of Hezbollah’s terrorist support network.” In fact, Hezbollah’s presence in Venezuela goes back many years, is well entrenched, and enjoys the support of high-ranking government officials. The US has managed to capture and prosecute several key collaborators with Hezbollah’s network in Latin America, including Venezuela. This extensive network engages in money laundering, drug trafficking and arms smuggling in an integrated and highly effective manner to provide Hezbollah with both the funds and arms it needs for its worldwide operations. Hezbollah’s presence in Venezuela goes back many years, is well entrenched, and enjoys the support of high-ranking government officials. Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg In addition to allowing Hezbollah to engage in criminal activities in the country, the Venezuelan government was accused of providing support for the group. Long before the current crisis, the US accused members of the government of providing direct financial aid to Hezbollah through the Venezuelan Embassy in Damascus. It named one Venezuelan diplomat in that embassy as an “operative” of Hezbollah who used Venezuelan entities to launder money for the group with Maduro’s personal approval. In Venezuela, Hezbollah’s footprints are so deep and widespread that, even if the current crisis ends with a victory for the opposition, led by Juan Guaido, it would be extremely difficult for him or any other future Venezuelan government to stamp out the organization’s presence and influence. During former President Hugo Chavez’s rule, Venezuela’s relationship with Hezbollah became institutionalized as part of his grand plan to counter the US by enlisting the help of Hezbollah’s paymasters in Iran. Chavez forged close relationships with former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Libya’s leader Muammar Qaddafi, and Syria’s Bashar Assad. As a result, Hezbollah thrived and enjoyed public support from the Venezuelan government. In the current crisis, Hezbollah has come out very strongly in support for Maduro, as have Iran and Syria. Exposing the full extent of the Maduro government’s relationship with Hezbollah and the entanglement of senior officials with the group will make a strong argument in favor of Guaido, because Hezbollah is involved in serious criminal activity in Venezuela (and elsewhere), including drug trafficking, money laundering and arms smuggling. The US in particular will feel obligated to address more forcefully Hezbollah’s presence in Venezuela. If the US is going around the Middle East and elsewhere to counter the malign activities of Iran and its proxies, and their attempts to circumvent US sanctions, it should do the same in Venezuela, virtually America’s own backyard. Regardless of how the Venezuelan crisis evolves, the US and its allies should redouble their efforts to counter Hezbollah’s attempts to increase its influence and malign activities in Venezuela. Like other terror organizations, Hezbollah thrives in crises, taking advantage of ungoverned spaces in Venezuela and near its borders to increase its activities. As Iran and Hezbollah are squeezed by US sanctions, they are exploiting loopholes and gaps in sanction enforcement. Venezuela provides an ideal situation for them, with a sympathetic government that is preoccupied with its own survival.

Szubin, Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control at the Treasury, lamented that: “It is extremely troubling to see the government of Venezuela employing and providing safe harbor to Hezbollah facilitators and fundraisers.” He vowed to “continue to expose the global nature of Hezbollah’s terrorist support network.” In fact, Hezbollah’s presence in Venezuela goes back many years, is well entrenched, and enjoys the support of high-ranking government officials. The US has managed to capture and prosecute several key collaborators with Hezbollah’s network in Latin America, including Venezuela. This extensive network engages in money laundering, drug trafficking and arms smuggling in an integrated and highly effective manner to provide Hezbollah with both the funds and arms it needs for its worldwide operations. Hezbollah’s presence in Venezuela goes back many years, is well entrenched, and enjoys the support of high-ranking government officials. Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg In addition to allowing Hezbollah to engage in criminal activities in the country, the Venezuelan government was accused of providing support for the group. Long before the current crisis, the US accused members of the government of providing direct financial aid to Hezbollah through the Venezuelan Embassy in Damascus. It named one Venezuelan diplomat in that embassy as an “operative” of Hezbollah who used Venezuelan entities to launder money for the group with Maduro’s personal approval. In Venezuela, Hezbollah’s footprints are so deep and widespread that, even if the current crisis ends with a victory for the opposition, led by Juan Guaido, it would be extremely difficult for him or any other future Venezuelan government to stamp out the organization’s presence and influence. During former President Hugo Chavez’s rule, Venezuela’s relationship with Hezbollah became institutionalized as part of his grand plan to counter the US by enlisting the help of Hezbollah’s paymasters in Iran. Chavez forged close relationships with former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Libya’s leader Muammar Qaddafi, and Syria’s Bashar Assad. As a result, Hezbollah thrived and enjoyed public support from the Venezuelan government. In the current crisis, Hezbollah has come out very strongly in support for Maduro, as have Iran and Syria. Exposing the full extent of the Maduro government’s relationship with Hezbollah and the entanglement of senior officials with the group will make a strong argument in favor of Guaido, because Hezbollah is involved in serious criminal activity in Venezuela (and elsewhere), including drug trafficking, money laundering and arms smuggling. The US in particular will feel obligated to address more forcefully Hezbollah’s presence in Venezuela. If the US is going around the Middle East and elsewhere to counter the malign activities of Iran and its proxies, and their attempts to circumvent US sanctions, it should do the same in Venezuela, virtually America’s own backyard. Regardless of how the Venezuelan crisis evolves, the US and its allies should redouble their efforts to counter Hezbollah’s attempts to increase its influence and malign activities in Venezuela. Like other terror organizations, Hezbollah thrives in crises, taking advantage of ungoverned spaces in Venezuela and near its borders to increase its activities. As Iran and Hezbollah are squeezed by US sanctions, they are exploiting loopholes and gaps in sanction enforcement. Venezuela provides an ideal situation for them, with a sympathetic government that is preoccupied with its own survival.

News article:
GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States scoffed on Friday at Venezuela’s accusation that it was poisoning humanitarian aid, and urged allies to stop the “decrepit, dictatorial regime” of President Nicolas Maduro from chairing U.N. arms talks. Sacks containing humanitarian aid are pictured at a warehouse near the Tienditas cross-border bridge between Colombia and Venezuela in Cucuta, Colombia February 14, 2019. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido U.S. envoy Robert Wood was speaking to the Conference on Disarmament hosted by the United Nations in Geneva that Maduro’s now widely-rejected government is due to chair from May 27. “I’m taking the floor to put on the record my government’s strong opposition to a representative of the former Maduro regime occupying the seat reserved for Venezuela,” he said. Washington is among some 50 governments, including major Latin American and European nations, who have disavowed Maduro and recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido. Last month, Guaido invoked the constitution to assume the interim presidency on promises to end a humanitarian crisis. Wood said a Venezuelan chairmanship would further undercut the forum’s credibility after the “disastrous” Syrian presidency in 2018 which the United States boycotted. “In order to preserve the integrity, dignity and respect for this chamber, Maduro representatives must vacate the chair reserved for the government of Venezuela,” he said. “Let us not give one iota of legitimacy to this decrepit, dictatorial regime.” A Venezuelan representative said Wood was showing how little the United States cared about disarmament. “To come here and talk about how to overthrow the government of my country - this is really not a priority for discussion,” the diplomat said. Maduro, who is backed by China, Russia and Venezuela’s top military brass, accuses Washington of seeking a coup to take over the OPEC nation’s oil wealth. On Tuesday, his Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said the United States was trying to send contaminated and carcinogenic aid into Venezuela, where the economy is in collapse and millions are facing hunger and shortages. “Various scientific studies have shown that this so-called food from the United States aims to poison our population with chemicals. We could say that this humanitarian aid is a biological weapon,” she told a news conference. Wood said Maduro’s government would go to any length to lie and deny reality. “It even made one of the most outrageous charges the international community has heard in decades: that the United States is sending in biological weapons as part of humanitarian assistance we have provided. Biological weapons? Really?” Diplomats from Syria, Iran, North Korea, Cuba and Russia criticized the U.S. stance, while Australia’s representative said it was good to respectfully air views. Syria’s representative said the forum had no business shedding “crocodile tears” over humanitarian suffering and rights, while the United States was violating international law by sending troops to its country.

US preparing for military action in Venezuela: Cuba Iran Press TV Fri Feb 15, 2019 01:37AM The United States is moving its special forces closer to Venezuela as part of a covert plan to stage military intervention in the South American country, which has been engulfed by unrest over the past weeks. Cuba said in a "Declaration of the Revolutionary Government" on Thursday that recent events in Venezuela, where US-backed opposition Juan Guaido has been challenging the leadership of President Nicolas Maduro, amounted to an attempted coup that had so far failed. US President Donald Trump's administration has refused to rule out direct military action against Maduro to force him step down and hand over power to Guaido, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly. Havana said that Washington has been expanding the presence of its forces in neighboring countries. "Between February 6 and 10 military transport aircraft have flown to the Rafael Miranda Airport of Puerto Rico, the San Isidro Air Base, in the Dominican Republic and to other strategically located Caribbean islands, probably without knowledge of the governments of those nations," the declaration said. "These flights originated in American military installations from which units of Special Operations and Marine Corps operate, which are used for covert actions," it added. Tens of thousands of Venezuelans have thronged the streets of Venezuela over the past weeks, holding rallies in support and against Maduro, who began his second six-year term in office last month. The clashes began after Guaido proclaimed himself "interim president" and urged Maduro to resign. The US rushed to support Guaido, announcing sanctions on the country's oil industry. According to the Havana declaration, the drastic sanctions imposed by the US were causing damage "1,000 times greater" than the aid Washington was reportedly trying to force on the country. US special envoy for Venezuela Elliott Abrams dismissed the Cuban announcement as "a new lie." The Dominican Republic's foreign minister, Miguel Vargas, also reiterated support for a peaceful solution and said no US military transport planes had landed in his country. Besides the US, other major Western powers such as the UK, France, Spain and Germany have recognized Guaido as president. Russia, China, Iran and Turkey are some of the countries that have thrown their support behind Maduro. In a recent interview with CBS, Trump said military action against Maduro remained "an option." Other US officials have also doubled down on the possibility of military action, with National Security Adviser John Bolton going as far as warning the Venezuelan military to join Guaido and take his "amnesty" before they lose the chance. However, Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, made it clear on Wednesday that the US Congress won't allow Trump tp launch a military intervention in Venezuela. Under US law, Congress must approve foreign military action and the president doesn't have the power to act on his own. NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
Maduro warns US against aggression, says Venezuela possesses advanced weapons Iran Press TV Thu Feb 21, 2019 02:37PM President Nicolas Maduro warns the US against carrying out the threat of military action in Venezuela, saying the country's armed forces are in possession of advanced weaponry supplied by Russia and China, and stand fully ready to face any act of aggression with the help of millions of paramilitaries. In an interview with Iran's Spanish-language Hispan TV, Maduro said the Caracas government takes Washington's military threats seriously and is already making preparations "to protect our borders and territorial integrity." "We recently held five days of maneuvers. Venezuela is also in possession of advanced military equipment, which it has received via China and Russia. We have upgraded our entire military and expanded our popular paramilitary forces, whose numbers will reach two million by April," the president added. Political tensions have been running high in the South American country since late January, when Western-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido abruptly declared himself "interim president" of Venezuela in an attempt to dispute last year's re-election of Maduro. The US and a number of its Latin American allies rushed to recognize Guaido. Several European countries also followed suit after Caracas dismissed an ultimatum they had set for a new presidential vote. In the other camp, Russia, China, Iran, Turkey and Cuba, among others, have voiced support for Maduro in the face of what Caracas views as a US-directed coup bid. The United Nations has also said it will only cooperate with the elected government. After recognizing Guaido, Trump threatened that military intervention in Venezuela was an "option" to support Guaido. In what Maduro condemned as an "almost Nazi-style" speech in Miami on February 19, Trump appealed directly to the Venezuelan military to abandon their support for Maduro, threatening that those who continued to back the Caracas government were risking their own future and lives. In the interview, Maduro rejected the possibility of the military turning against the Venezuelan government and said "our armed forces act in unison when it comes to morality, doctrine and strategy. They abide by the Constitution." Elsewhere in the interview, the Venezuelan head of state slammed Washington for slapping sanctions on the country's national petroleum company, PDVSA, in a bid to speed up the exit of the elected government, which relies heavily on crude exports for its revenues.The bans have been designed to funnel income from the country's largest revenue generator into the hands of Guaido. Maduro said the oil sanctions "will be to the detriment of the United States itself," because the Americans will have to buy lower-quality oil at a higher price from other parts of the world. The sanctions, he added, "would cause certain problems for us, but we will overcome these conditions. Be sure that Venezuela will sell its oil in the international markets and we will receive the income in time." "I personally tell you that I am working on reviving and forming a new PDVSA, about which I will issue an important statement in the coming days," Maduro said. Maduro also blasted Trump for adopting an "extremist, unwise and improper" position against Venezuela. America's president wants to bring Venezuela to its knees, said Maduro, adding that his main concern is not "democracy" or "humanitarian crisis," but he has an eye on the country's wealth and rich energy resources. Maduro outlined the measures taken by his administration to alleviate the nation's economic problems, saying that the top priority is to decrease the unemployment rate. "Venezuela will move on from all these acts of aggression. We will teach them a big lesson and promote our political, economic and social life," Maduro said, adding, "The battle is to protect not only Venezuela, but also independence, dignity, humanity and international law." The Venezuelan president went on to say, "The era for coups d'état and invasion…must come to an end. The 19th and 20th centuries are over. The current century is no time for neo-imperialism and slavery." Warning to Europe He also denounced the European Union's bias in favor of the Venezuelan opposition, saying the 28-nation bloc is making a "fundamental mistake" in dealing with the Latin American state. Europe only "listens to the rightist (opposition) and believes all their lies," Maduro added, advising the European countries to "lend an ear to the truth." The Union blindly follows the US in its aggressive approach towards Venezuela, said the president, warning that the Europeans will have blood on their hands if Venezuela comes under attack "as it happened in Iraq, Libya and Syria."

Iran slams foreign intervention in Venezuela, backs government Iran Press TV Sun Feb 24, 2019 03:22PM Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has slammed foreign intervention in Venezuela's internal affairs amid escalation of the political crisis in the Latin American country. The Islamic Republic supports Venezuelan government and nation, Zarif said in a meeting with Ruben Dario Molina, Venezuela's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs for Asia and the Middle East, in Tehran on Sunday. The top Iranian diplomat added that Tehran supports Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's proposal for political talks between the government and the opposition with the purpose of resolving differences. Late last month, Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro said he was ready to sit down for talks with the country's opposition and was also open to the possibility of third countries mediating. The Venezuelan diplomat, who is in Tehran at the head of a delegation, commended Iran's efforts to help improve the political situation in his country. Zarif and Dario Molina emphasized that the meddlesome US measures in Venezuela and other Latin American countries as well as Washington's threats to use force against Caracas are in violation of international law and the United Nations Charter, and are doomed to fail. Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido, 35, who is also the head of Venezuela's defunct National Assembly, plunged the country into political chaos on January 23, when he proclaimed himself as the "interim president" of Venezuela, a bizarre move that drew US President Donald Trump's immediate support and prompted the White House to call on other countries to follow suit in recognizing Guaido as such. The US-backed opposition figure has also planned to bring in foreign humanitarian aid, including those from the US through the Colombian border, to allegedly alleviate the country's economic crisis. Maduro has said the real incentive behind Guaido's "relief" effort is to undermine his government in a Washington-orchestrated bid to oust him, stressing that Caracas would not allow the entry of the so-called aid to Venezuela, which has the world's largest proven oil reserves. Earlier this month, Russia warned that the United States is considering a range of options against the government of Maduro, including a direct military invasion of the Latin American country. "There are still signs coming from Washington about the possibility of using force in order to overthrow the legal authorities, including through direct military invasion," Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in Moscow, adding, "This is actually being spoken about openly in the White House." In a phone conversation with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza in January, Zarif said the Islamic Republic supports the legal government in Venezuela and the country's people in the face of all plots, particularly those hatched by the United States. Zarif and Arreaza also exchanged views about ways to expand negotiations between the Venezuelan government and the opposition groups and find a political solution to the conflict.

Speaking at the Lima group meeting in Bogota, Mourao, a retired general, said that Brazil will do all it can to avoid a conflict with neighboring Venezuela. Meanwhile, the Brazilian National Public Security Force has expanded the security cordon in the border area with Venezuela to alleviate tensions following recent clashes, a Sputnik correspondent reported from the scene on Monday. In the early hours of Sunday, a Sputnik correspondent reported that a group of activists supporting the Venezuelan opposition in Brazil had attacked the border checkpoint near the Brazilian city of Pacaraima, setting a Venezuelan National Guard vehicle on fire. The attackers also threw sticks and stones at Venezuelan soldiers, who responded with tear gas.

Maduro will also want UN “experts” to blame #Venezuela crisis on sanctions.” HUNDREDS OF VENEZUELA'S MILITARY DEFECT IN FOUR DAYS AS COUNTRY SPIRALS INTO FURTHER CHAOS “When it comes to democracy & human rights UN increasingly worthless,” he said. Disputed President Nicolas Maduro’s forces fired tear gas and buckshot on activists over the weekend as they tried to deliver humanitarian aid across the border. The U.S. and around 50 other countries have recognized National Assembly leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate leader after disputed elections, and called for Maduro to step down. Univision anchor Jorge Ramos was briefly arrested and detained on Monday after he showed the president video footage of three children on the streets of Venezuela rummaging through the back of a garbage truck looking for food scraps -- the latest sign of the economic catastrophe his regime has wrought on his people. Rubio’s remarks represent part of a broader concern by conservatives that left-wing governments and institutions like the U.N. are downplaying the humanitarian crisis engulfing Venezuela due to its socialist ideology. In the U.S., politicians such as 2020 presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders have come under fire for their alleged failure to call out the Maduro regime. Meanwhile, there have been plenty of officials in international institutions lining up to condemn President Trump’s not-yet-built wall on the southern border Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was criticized by Rubio specifically for repeated meetings with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, offering to help conduct a “serious negotiation to help the country out of the present standoff for the benefit of the people of Venezuela.” Guterres’ statements since then have been weaker than what many hope the international body would issue given such dire circumstances, a statement in which his office said he was following “with increasing concern the escalation of tensions in Venezuela.” “The Secretary-General appeals for violence to be avoided at any cost and for lethal force not to be used in any circumstances,” his office said. “The Secretary-General appeals for calm and urges all actors to lower tensions and pursue every effort to prevent further escalation.” POMPEO URGES VENEZUELAN SECURITY FORCES TO LET HUMANITARIAN AID INTO THE COUNTRY: 'DO THE RIGHT THING' On Sunday, Human Rights Chief Michelle Bachelet was somewhat stronger as she decried “disgraceful scenes.” “The Venezuelan government must stop its forces from using excessive force against unarmed protesters and ordinary citizens,” she said. While appeals to “both sides” are typical of U.N. officials -- who regularly seek neutrality as much as possible so as to be a neutral space for negotiation -- to those looking for a tougher line on the Maduro regime, the statement from Guterres is likely only to fuel their disappointment. “The U.N. has not taken a side except that the U.N.’s concern is for the people of Venezuela,” spokesman Stephane Dujarric told Fox News Tuesday. “We’ve expressed our concern at the humanitarian problem in Venezuela. We’ve been working, our colleagues on the ground are working with the government to try to scale up the humanitarian aid notably in the areas of nutrition and health, and we will continue to do that,” he said. “But I think what we are seeing, what we saw over the weekend just makes it clearer for the need for a negotiated settlement.” Former Venezuelan U.N. diplomat Isaias Medina, who resigned his post in protest against Maduro’s policies in 2017, told Fox News the organization was suffering from “no clear movement or decision making" on the humanitarian situation. “The U.N. paralysis in Venezuela regarding the protection of the civilian population is only comparable to its empathy toward Maduro's regime,” he told Fox News. VENEZUELA UNVEILS ANTI-US COALITION AT UNITED NATIONS On Tuesday Under-Secretary General Rosemary DiCarlo addressed the Security Council on the subject and said it was working to provide assistance to those in need, particularly on saving lives, conflict prevention and human rights. “Such assistance should be free from political objectives and delivered on the basis of need,” she said. At the Council meeting, Arreaza accused the U.N. of being biased against Venezuela and accused the U.S. of attempting to push a coup. “Allow me to say to you [DiCarlo] that your briefing, your explanation was biased,” he said. “It always sought to disseminate information from one source and incidentally with all respect I don't at all agree, it is not in line with what we spoke with in our meeting with [Guterres]. “We denounce the United States government for organizing, financing and leading this clear aggression against Venezuela,” he said. Furthermore, far from being a neutral space for dialogue and negotiation, the U.N.’s New York headquarters is becoming something of a rallying point for pro-Maduro countries to give support to the failing regime. Arreaza, this month, announced the formation of a group that he said would defend the U.N. Charter, flanked by more than a dozen ambassadors and diplomats from countries including Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Syria, China and Russia. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Arreaza said that the new group would be conducting “a series of actions to increase awareness around the dangers that our peoples currently face, particularly the case of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. We call upon all the member states of the U.N. to join us in defending international law as the only guarantor of ... peaceful coexistence.” Former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley this month said that such a coalition was a “shameful waste of the U.N.’s time & resources.” “W/ friends like Russia, China, Iran, Syria & the Palestinian Authority it's no wonder Maduro's socialist regime is crumbling,” she tweeted. “We must keep up the pressure & support the ppl’s voices for democracy in Venezuela.”

© IRNA © Agencia EFE "We're calling for dialogue, dialogue with the United States - why not between Presidents Maduro and Trump? Why shouldn't they meet so that they could try to find common ground and explain their differences?" "Under the pretext of humanitarian aid, an intervention against Venezuela is intended," he also said. "Voting on Russia's draft will be held on Thursday after the vote on the US draft document," the source said. The claim that Hezbollah has ties to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was reinforced by a report by the Jerusalem Post, citing former Venezuelan Intelligence Chief Hugo Carvajal. The article was originally published on February 24, but US National Security Adviser shared it on twitter on February 27, with accusations that no longer mention "Maduro and his cronies," but rather Maduro and "a counsel of terrorists and Cuban minders."According to the Jerusalem Post article, which itself cites a NYT report , Carvajal revealed powerful ties between the administration of President Nicolás Maduro and the Hezbollah terrorist group, as well as wide-spread corruption and drug activity.Allegedly, those who were meant to combat drugs were engaged in trafficking them, Carvajal said.El Aissami was not only a drug kingpin, said Carvajal, but also had connections to Hezbollah, and attempted to arrange Hezbollah terrorists to work with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] through Venezuela.The claim that Hezbollah has ties with the Maduro government was initially suggested by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo close around 14 days earlier.On February 24th, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif expressed his country's support of Maduro's government and slammed any foreign intervention in Venezuela's internal affairs. Thus, it is also possible that accusations of Iranian influence to being circulating the media soon.Meanwhile, Reuters reported, citing opposition Legislator Angel Alvarado and three anonymous government sources who claimed that Nicolas Maduro had removed at least 8 tons of gold from the Venezuelan central bank's vaults between February 20and 22This was done while there were no regular security guards present at the bank. According to Alvarado they plan to sell it illegally abroad.The anonymous sources and Alvarado did not say where the gold would be sold. They said the operation took place while central bank head Calixto Ortega was abroad on a trip.Separately, on February 27the containers were also placed on the Simon Bolivar bridge to block it as well. It is a major pedestrian crossing between Colombia and Venezuela. It is also the place where the "humanitarian aid truck" was set on fire allegedly by the Venezuelan military.The Tienditas bridge, which is blocked for passage all year round was also blocked by shipping containers in January.US-Proclaimed Interim President Juan Guaido who travelled to Colombia, despite a travel ban imposed by the Venezuelan Supreme Court also travelled to Brazil on the evening of February 27to meet with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro as part of a tour of several nations to ratchet up international pressure on President Nicolas Maduro to step down.Maduro said that Guaido should face justice after he returns to Venezuela because he went against the supreme court's ruling.Meanwhile, in his address to the UN Human Rights Council Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza suggested that Maduro and Trump should meet and "try to find common ground and explain their differences."US Vice President Mike Pence discarded the suggestion, saying that the only thing to discuss is the exact "time and date of his [Maduro's] departure."On Thursday, both the US and Russia submitted their own draft resolutions on the Venezuelan crisis.The decision to submit the Russian draft resolution was announced by Russian mission to the UN Fyodor Strzhizhovsky.An anonymous diplomatic source told TASS that the vote on Russia's draft resolution on Venezuela at the UN Security Council is planned for Thursday.Maduro's vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, is also to travel to Moscow for talks with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on March 1. Russia has continued to support Maduro government throughout the crisis and despite continuing false media reports that it is doubting the "regime."

Guaido Vows to Return to Venezuela After Ecuador Visit - Reports Sputnik News 03:23 03.03.2019(updated 03:45 03.03.2019) The self-proclaimed interim president of Venezuela Juan Guaido crossed into Colombia in late February in defiance of a Venezuelan Supreme Court order barring him from leaving the country due to an ongoing investigation. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said earlier this week that Guaido must face trial after his return for breaking the travel ban. According to Reuters, Guaido visited Paraguay and Argentina on Friday to shore up Latin American support for a transition government for the crisis-torn country. Guaido said Saturday, cited by Reuters, he would return to Venezuela from Ecuador, where he is meeting with the country's president Lenin Moreno. Guaido also said that he was calling for new protests next week in Venezuela. However, the opposition leader did not specify the particular timeline of his return, according to Reuters. US Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams told reporters during a press briefing on Friday that Washington is concerned about Guaido's ability to return to the country and warns about a major international reaction in case of the self-proclaimed president's arrest. Similarly, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini warned on Saturday that any possible measure that could put at risk Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido's freedom and safety would lead to a new escalation of crisis around the Latin American country and face a strong international condemnation. After unsuccessful attempts to deliver US-sponsored humanitarian aid to Venezuela from the neighboring country, Guaido said that he plans to return home. According to the deputy judge of the Venezuelan Supreme Tribunal of Justice, Juan Carlos Valdez, Guaido could face up to 30 years in jail for breaching foreign travel ban. The situation in crisis-torn Venezuela escalated on 23 January when the opposition leader, Juan Guaido, declared himself interim president, disputing last year's reelection of Maduro. Guaido was almost immediately recognized by the United States and some other countries. Russia, China, Mexico, Iran, Turkey among other nations, voiced support for constitutionally elected Maduro, who, in turn, accused Washington of orchestrating a coup. © Sputnik NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

'Significant Response': Bolton Warns Against Attempts to Prevent Guaido Return Sputnik News 05:14 04.03.2019(updated 06:02 04.03.2019) US National Security Advisor John Bolton said Sunday that any attempt to prevent the safe return of Venezuela's self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaido would meet "strong and significant response" from Washington. Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido has announced his return to Venezuela after the Latin American tour he kicked off in defiance of a travel ban, calling for new demonstrations to be held across the country on Monday. John Bolton said earlier that Washington plans to create a coalition to change the government in Venezuela amid the ongoing political crisis in the Latin American country. "We are trying to rally support for the peaceful transition of power from [Venezuelan President Nicolas] Maduro to [self-proclaimed interim president of Venezuela] Juan Guaido, whom we recognize as president […] I'd like to see as broad a coalition as we can put together to replace Maduro, to replace the whole corrupt regime. That's what we are trying to do", Bolton said in an interview for the CNN broadcaster. Earlier this week, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who has repeatedly slammed Guaido as a "US puppet" and accused Washington of trying to stage a coup in Venezuela, said that the opposition leader must be tried if he returns. US-backed Guaido, who proclaimed himself Venezuelan interim president in January, crossed into Colombia on 22 February in defiance of a Venezuelan Supreme Court order barring him from leaving the country due to an ongoing investigation. After unsuccessful attempts to deliver US-sponsored humanitarian aid to Venezuela from the neighboring country, Guaido said that he plans to return home. According to the deputy judge of the Venezuelan Supreme Tribunal of Justice, Juan Carlos Valdez, Guaido may face up to 30 years in jail for breaching foreign travel ban. US Special Envoy for Venezuela Elliott Abrams has threatened Caracas with a major international reaction in case of Guaido's arrest. The United States has recognized Guaido and around 50 other countries followed suit. Russia, China, Cuba, Bolivia, Iran, Turkey and a number of other states have, in the meantime, voiced their support for the legitimate government of constitutionally elected Maduro. Mexico and Uruguay have refused to recognize Guaido, declaring themselves neutral and promoting crisis settlement via dialogue. © Sputnik NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

US special envoy for Venezuela Elliott Abrams failed to provide any legal reasons for Swiss banks to freeze Venezuelan government-linked accounts in a prank phone call placed by a famous Russian comedic duo. "I think everything should be frozen," the voice, allegedly belonging to Abrams, told pranksters Vovan and Lexus who were posing as the President of Switzerland and the chief of the nation's Department of Finance, Ueli Maurer. The men, whose real names are Vladimir Kuznetsov and Aleksey Stolyarov, are known for pulling off successful pranks on high-ranking politicians and public figures. They told the media that the conversation with Abrams was recorded in February. The prankers told their interlocutor that the accounts of Venezuela's state-run oil company, PDVSA, as well as assets belonging to President Nicolas Maduro's inner circle, were discovered in "several large banks," including the made-up Limpopo Bank (named after a river in South Africa featured in a popular Russian children's story). However, Switzerland would need "serious" legal grounds to freeze the assets, they explained, asking Abrams to provide proof that the assets in question were "created by crime." "It's kind of obvious in this sense," the US special envoy for Venezuela replied. "If you are a public servant in Venezuela, there's no possible legal way that you could have acquired these amounts of money," he said. Washington, along with its allies in Europe and South America, have been openly backing Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who declared himself 'interim president' in January. The move was denounced by current President Maduro. The US has stepped up the pressure and sanctions on the Maduro government, while urging other nations to back Guaido and seize the assets of senior officials and state-run companies. In the phone call, the pranksters repeatedly pressed the man they said was US envoy Abrams to present some sort of data indicating that Venezuelan foreign assets were generated via corruption or other illicit activities. He failed to provide any concrete evidence but, nevertheless, insisted that they should block access to the accounts anyway. The man acknowledged that the situation on the ground in Caracas is a "dispute" with "most Western governments having taken a side" in it. His ultimate advice was: "The better wisdom would be to freeze the accounts." Vovan and Lexus also told the media that after speaking with Abrams, they were contacted by Venezuelan politician Carlos Vecchio, who Juan Guaido appointed as his envoy to the US. Vecchio was snooping for Maduro's personal assets and wanted to find out when his 'government' could "gain access" to them, the pranksters claimed. According to them, they told Guaido's envoy that Maduro keeps his money in the Fund Nurlan Baidilda (which actually exists and is owned by a Russian citizen). Vecchio took this information as truth and later shared it with Bloomberg and posted it on Twitter. 2.We are conducting an investigation to recover stolen assets. As a result, we have good reason to believe that a large part of these funds is located in the Fund Nurlan Baidilda Ltd. in an account belonging to the dictator @nicolasmaduro . — CARLOS VECCHIO (@carlosvecchio) February 25, 2019 A veteran politician with the Department of State, Elliott Abrams was heavily criticized for his role in shaping the US policy of interventions in Central America during the Cold War. Also on rt.com WATCH Ilhan Omar grill US Venezuela envoy on war crimes of previous US-backed coups In 1991, he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about his role in the Iran-Contra Affair, the covert program of supplying weapons to right-wing rebels seeking to overthrow the socialist government in Nicaragua.

EU warns US against military action on Venezuela Iran Press TV Tue Mar 12, 2019 06:15PM The European Union has cautioned the United States against taking military action against Venezuela, saying the Latin American country's crisis has to be resolved through peaceful and political solutions. "We believe that no military development, from inside or outside of the country, would be acceptable," EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told a United Nations Security Council meeting on cooperation between the European Union and the UN on Tuesday. "A solution cannot be, and should never be, imposed from the outside," she asserted. "The crisis that affects the country has political and institutional causes. It's not a natural disaster. Its solution needs to be peaceful, political, and democratic," said Mogherini. The official also reminded that the bloc had set up a contact group with Latin American countries to push for a political process. Venezuela has been facing dire economic conditions and months-long protests, with President Nicolas Maduro putting the country's woes down to US interventionism and accusing Washington of attempting a coup against his government. Congress chief Juan Guaido named himself as Venezuela's interim president amid the crisis in January. Washington took the lead in recognizing his claim followed by the US' major European allies, including France, Germany, and Britain. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that all options are on the table in promoting Washington's choice for Guaido over Maduro. Russia, China and Iran have, however, roundly rejected the US' meddlesome push targeting Venezuela. Caracas expels US diplomats Also on Tuesday, Venezuela ordered American diplomats to leave the country within 72 hours after Maduro accused Trump of cyber "sabotage" that has plunged the country into days-long blackout. Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza made the announcement after talks broke down over maintaining diplomatic "interest sections" in the two countries. "The presence on Venezuelan soil of these officials represents a risk for the peace, unity, and stability of the country," the government also said in a statement. A day earlier, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had announced that the United States would withdraw the diplomats. The US State Department, meanwhile, said their presence had become "a constraint on US policy." NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

The official also reminded that the bloc had set up a contact group with Latin American countries to push for a political process. Venezuela has been facing dire economic conditions and months-long protests, with President Nicolas Maduro putting the country's woes down to US interventionism and accusing Washington of attempting a coup against his government. Congress chief Juan Guaido named himself as Venezuela's interim president amid the crisis in January. Washington took the lead in recognizing his claim followed by the US' major European allies, including France, Germany, and Britain. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that all options are on the table in promoting Washington's choice for Guaido over Maduro. Russia, China and Iran have, however, roundly rejected the US' meddlesome push targeting Venezuela. Caracas expels US diplomats Also on Tuesday, Venezuela ordered American diplomats to leave the country within 72 hours after Maduro accused Trump of cyber "sabotage" that has plunged the country into days-long blackout. Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza made the announcement after talks broke down over maintaining diplomatic "interest sections" in the two countries. "The presence on Venezuelan soil of these officials represents a risk for the peace, unity, and stability of the country," the government also said in a statement. A day earlier, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had announced that the United States would withdraw the diplomats. The US State Department, meanwhile, said their presence had become "a constraint on US policy." NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
(Miami Herald/TNS) — The Trump administration is considering imposing sanctions on companies from third countries that facilitate the shipment of Venezuelan oil to Cuba, a senior administration official said. “The interim president of Venezuela, Juan Guaido, recognized by the U.S. and Europe, where most of these companies are from, has asked us to stop these shipments and we are considering everything to be supportive,” the official said. The Venezuelan National Assembly, controlled by the opposition, agreed to suspend the shipment of crude oil to Cuba as part of a state of emergency decree approved Monday to respond to the chaos caused by a major electrical blackout. Guaido published on Twitter a chart estimating that the Nicolas Maduro regime sends 47,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba, worth about $2.5 million under current world oil prices. The decision “to cut the oil supply to Cuba asserts our independence,” Guaido wrote on Twitter. And the income from oil should boost the reconstruction of Venezuela.” The U.S. official said the administration is “aware of these shipments, we know where they are and who the companies are.” The official said both the United States and the interim Venezuelan government could take legal action against the companies. The United States has imposed similar sanctions on companies facilitating trade with North Korea and Iran. There are other steps the United States can take to increase pressure on the Maduro government, the official said, including the interdiction of oil shipments, “but we´re on step 1.” Through an agreement between the Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez to exchange oil for medical services, Venezuela sends 40,000 to 50,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba, less than half what it supplied a few years ago before oil production plunged under Maduro. In the midst of the deepest drop in oil production in 33 years, Venezuelan oil company PDVSA also bought $440 million in Russian oil to ship to Cuba from January 2017 to May 2018, according to documents obtained by Reuters. The company paid $12 more per barrel than the subsidized price for shipments under the barter agreement with Cuba. These shipments could stop or be substantially reduced if the National Assembly, with the aid of the U.S. government, succeeds in stopping the shipments or at least disrupts their transportation. The National Assembly appears to have taken control of Citgo, the PDVSA subsidiary in the United States, and appointed a new board to run PDVSA, but it is not clear yet how much control it has over the national oil firm.

News article:
Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro's government said Thursday that it has banned opposition leader Juan Guaido from public office for 15 years. The ban comes after Guaido challenged Maduro last week, saying his government was too dysfunctional to arrest him. Elvis Amoroso, the country's comptroller and a close ally of Maduro, made the announcement on state television, citing alleged irregularities with Guaido's finances. “We’re going to continue in the streets,” Guaido declared in response. Both opposition protesters and government forces plan on more demonstrations this week in their attempts to gain legitimacy. The United States and dozens of other countries recognize Guaido as the interim president of Venezuela, while China, Iran, and Russia back Maduro. Widespread protests broke out in the country when Maduro inaugurated his second term in January after what observers called a fraudulent election. Two million people have fled Venezuela during Maduro's rule, with food shortages and power outages becoming increasingly frequent. On Wednesday, President Trump hosted Guaido's wife, Fabiana Rosales and the wife of Guaido's chief of staff, Roberto Marrero, in the Oval Office. Romy Moreno Molina described the 2 a.m. raid on March 21 in which Maduro forces kidnapped her husband from their home. [Opinion: Venezuela is becoming Trump's version of Obama's Syria]

News article:
(MENAFN- AzerNews) By Abdul Kerimkhanov China and Iraq are the main trading partners of Iran, said the head of the Iranian Customs Directorate, Mehdi Mirashrafi. He noted that China and Iraq imported non-oil goods from Iran in the amount of $8.3 billion and $8.2 billion respectively. Iranian exports of oil and non-oil products reached $ 40 billion in the first 11 months of the current 1,397 fiscal year, Mirashrafi said, adding that China and Iraq were the main destinations for Iranian goods, Fars News reported. During his visit to the port of Bandar-e-Imam Khomeini, in Khuzestan province on March 4, an Iranian official told reporters that Khuzestan has a sea and land border with Iraq, and visiting the customs centers of the region is one of the goals of his visit. "The trip in Khuzestan is intended for infrastructure development so that Khuzestan can increase its share in maritime and border trading with Iraq," he said. In late December, the Iranian Trade PromotionOrganization announced that Iraq, China and the United Arab Emirates were respectively the three main points of Iran's external trade flow in the first eight months of the current Iranian year (launched March 21, 2018). It was noted that the country's exports to Azerbaijan recorded an increase of 50 percent over the same period. Iran has sufficient financial resources and high solvency, although the damage caused to the economy by the global fall in oil prices and lengthy sanctions in the field of finance has been significant. The disconnection of Iranian banks from the SWIFT system in March 2012 led to a sharp decline in foreign exchange earnings. In fact, the funds of Iranian oil importers remained in their accounts and, accordingly, could be used by Iran only for the purchase of products in the importing countries. On the other hand, the current situation had a positive side, since it led to an increase in trade with these states. The main industries of Iran are oil (including extraction and primary processing of oil and gas), processing (including petrochemicals) and mining. The relations of Iraq and Iran have now reached a qualitatively new level which has prepared the ground for strategic cooperation in the field of defense and security. Bilateral cooperation between Iran and China is comprehensive and encompasses political, economic, social and other areas, and both sides are in favor of expanding bilateral cooperation.

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, Mar. 7 By Elnur Baghishov – Trend: The potential of Iran's flour processing plants is very high and imports of wheat bring additional income to the country at the same time, an official of the Ministry of Agriculture Jihad of Iran told Fars News Agency, Trend reports. According to the official, the imported wheat is brought temporarily and flour products are being prepared. Last year, the Ministry of Agriculture Jihad signed a contract with Russia for the import of 1 million tons of wheat, so as to use the full potential of Iran's flour processing plants. "After being processed at 15 flour plants, the imported wheat is exported to countries of South-East Asia and China," he said. Over the past days, the movement of an Iranian cargo carrier with about 4,900 tons of wheat was impeded at the Volga River. This has caused some Iranians to wonder as to why wheat is being imported to Iran, when there is no need for that.

The first attack on Soviet anti-Semitism was launched at the United Nations General Assembly today by Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., head of the American delegation to the U.N., in the course of his first address to the Assembly. “The United States,” he said, “observed with indignation the persecution of Christians, Moslems and Jews that has been taking place in the Soviet Union for some time. That discrimination is not only wicked; it will also in the end prove to be totally ineffective because there is an undefeatable quality in human nature which will always resist totalitarian attempts to destroy religious and ethnic freedom.” Ambassador Abba Eban, head of the Israel delegation at the UN, today made an attempt to secure the earliest possible discussion at the Assembly of the anti-Jewish campaign in the Iron Curtain countries by voting with the Soviet bloc to put a Polish proposal on “measures to implement peace” third on the list of the agenda of the UN Political Committee, after the items on Korea and Greece. However, the motion was defeated by eight votes in favor, 33 against and 18 abstentions. Explaining his vote, Mr. Eban said “there were certain recent measures and movements” behind the Iron Curtain which he wished to bring to the attention of the United Nations. He was, of course, referring to the Soviet anti-Jewish campaign. He pointed out that since he wished to do this as soon as possible he was supporting moving the Polish proposal forward on the agenda. The item under which Israel will raise the issue of anti-Semitism remains in sixth place on the agenda.

The U.N. Security Council tonight voted, by one to one, with one abstention, to recommend the admission of Israel to the United nations. Final approval must be given by the General Assembly which will begin meeting again April 5. Britain abstained, while Egypt cast the lone negative ballot. Specifically the Council adopted a resolution proposed at the last minute by the United States, in which the Council recognizes that Israel “is a peace-loving state fully capable of carrying out its obligations under the Charter.” Explaining the British position, Sir Terrence Shone, in a carefully prepared statement, told the Council that his government was obliged to abstain until Israel ## “clarified” Its position with respect to the future of Jerusalem and the Palestine Arab refugees. At a press conference immediately following the Council’s vote, Aubrey S. ?ban, Israeli representative at the U.N. declared: “The Council has given decisive international recognition of Israel’s character as an independent peace-loving state. voiding controversial entanglements on the international scene, Israel seeks in the United Nations a comprehensive framework for a peaceful foreign policy.” He pledged Israel’s cooperation through the U.N. to rehabilitate the Middle East by regional economic planning.

News article:
The government and the opposition were united in the Knesset today in condemnation of the United Nations Security Council resolution calling for the dismantling of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and Jerusalem. Premier Menachem Begin indicated that he accepted President Carter’s explanation that U.S. support for the resolution was on error due to “a failure of communications” but he urged the U.S. to repudiate the resolution in its entirety. (Meanwhile, it was announced in Washington that a Congressional hearing will be held next Thursday to investigate the U.S. “out-up” in the UN. See separate story.) In a political statement to the Knesset, the first since the latest crisis in U.S. Israeli relations erupted, Begin repeated his claim that Israel has an undisputed right to settle anywhere in “Eretz Israel” and that the settlements are on integral part of the State’s security. He denounced the Security Council’s call for dismantling Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem as “barbaric.” Begin disclosed that he had received a cable from Carter explaining that the American vote had been cost in error on the assumption that a paragraph referring to Jerusalem had been deleted from the resolution. “It goes without saying that we regard the words of the American President with all due respect,” Begin said. But, he added: “A question must be asked whether this single error that Carter pointed at was the only expression of animosity in the resolution toward Israel and her vital interests. What about all other paragraphs which repeatedly mention Jerusalem and contradict the Camp David accords?” Labor Party chairman Shimon Peres supported the government’s stand against the American vote which, he said, went against “U.S. Mideast policy.” He also expressed opposition to the supply of sophisticated weaponry to the Arab states by the West, including the U.S. He said this limited Israel’s technological advantage over its neighbors. However, the opposition leader had strong criticism for Begin’s government. “We think that it caused, in a way, a deterioration of the Israeli position in the world,” he said. Referring to the controversial Hebron issue, Peres declared, “We are surely against settling Hebron with Jews as well as other settlements in the middle of densely populated Arab areas. “He said the only solution is to hold new elections to replace the present government with one that will adopt a clear policy. DAYAN ATTACKS SETTLEMENT POLICY Former Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan, on independent MK, surprised the Knesset with the vehemence of his attack on the government’s settlement policy, especially in Hebron. The settlement of Jews in Hebron is completely unnecessary, Dayan declared. If, indeed, the government believes the return of Jews to Hebron is so vital, why did it wait for a Jew to be murdered there before initiating such a step, he asked. He charged that the government was taking reprisal actions rather than adopting a clear policy in the occupied territories. Dayan also criticized the evacuation of the last Arab family from the Jewish quarter in East Jerusalem, Ayub Hamis Toutanji, his wife and six children, left their home overlooking the Temple Mount last Tuesday after on unsuccessful eight-year legal battle to retain ownership of the property that has belonged to his family since 1935. The neighbor-hood was taken over by the government after 1967 for conversion into on exclusively Jewish quarter. Dayan said the decision against the Toutanjis disturbed him both as a politician and a Jew. “Why? Why? What do we want, how do we want to live? Let us assume that an Arab would live in the Jewish quarter. So what?” Dayan asked.

News article:
The United States and Israel on one side, and the Soviet Union on the other, clashed here today over a proposal by Israel at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights that the world be called upon “to combat prejudices such as anti-Semitism.” The conflict developed at the morning session of the Commission during the debate of a draft United Nations Convention on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance a proposal which the USSR has been fighting here for six years through many parliamentary and procedural maneuvers. Israel’s representative on the Commission, Associate Israeli Supreme Court Justice Haim H. Cohn, submitted an amendment to one proposed article in the draft Convention, mentioning anti-Semitism specifically as a prejudice to combat. Evgeny Nasinovsky, the Soviet delegate to the Commission, presented an alternative amendment that would eliminate the word “anti-Semitism” and call, instead for “uniting the efforts of all persons and organizations, regardless of religion, in the interests of peace among peoples and states.” Morris B. Abram, the United States delegate to the Commission, backed the Israeli amendment. Referring to anti-Semitism as “the most pervasive and persistent form of the evil we are hoping to bring under international control, ” he asked the Commission: “Can it possibly do any harm for us to mention anti-Semitism in this Convention?” “My delegation believes,” Mr. Abram told the Commission, “that a specific reference to anti-Semitism in this Convention is not only proper but needed for many reasons. Anti-Semitism is an illustration of religious intolerance and discrimination in its most persistent and pervasive form. “Unchecked anti-Semitism, ” continued Mr. Abram, “played a leading role in the establishment of the criminal Nazi state which, in our own time, after devouring its Jewish population, proceeded to destroy the religious and political freedoms of other German citizens and then to the systematic genocide of several great peoples and the conquest of Europe. Anti-Semitism has played a critical role in the preparation of societies for the destruction of religious and political freedoms of everybody.” U.S. DELEGATE BACKS ISRAEL’S PROPOSAL WITH FORCEFUL ARGUMENTS Pointing out that some delegations in the last U.N. General Assembly noted that they believed a specific reference to anti-Semitism belonged in the Convention dealing with religious intolerance, and not in connection with racial discrimination, Mr. Abram said: “In the area of religious intolerance and discrimination, anti-Semitism is the classic case, as apartheid is in the area of racial discrimination.” “The anti-Semite, ” Mr. Abram continued, “advances any argument which will serve his ends, but the Jew is the only Semitic person whom he ever attacks, and his grounds will shift to exploit any advantage or when a previous argument has failed. Moreover, the same Jew may be described by the anti-Semite as a Wall Street capitalist and as a Communist; as a religious fanatic and an anti-religious devil; as an aggressive fighter and as a despicable coward.” Taking issue with the Soviet argument that peoples other than Jews are also Semites, and that therefore, it would be confusing to use the term in an international convention, the U.S. delegate urged the members of the Human Rights Commission to recognize this argument as “a quibble. ” The Soviet Government, he pointed out, had no problem about the meaning of the word anti-Semitism when, in July 1918, the Council of People’s Commissars declared that “the anti-Semitic movements and pogroms against the Jews are fatal to the interests of the workers’ and peasants’ revolution.” “Both the World Council of Churches and Vatican Council II of the Catholic Church have singled out anti-Semitism for specific condemnation,” he said. “The former, in November-December 1961, in a resolution on anti-Semitism urged its member churches ‘to do all in their power to resist every form of anti-Semitism.’ Pope Paul VI, on October 28, 1965, at the Vatican Council, promulgated the Declaration on the Relations of the Church to Non-Christian Religions which, as we have noted, specifically decried anti-Semitism and used that word.”

News article:
The mayor of Jerusalem, members of Congress and nearly every major American Jewish organization have weighed in with immediate criticism of U.N. Security Council Resolution 280. Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert sent a letter to President Clinton expressing “shock and disappointment” that the U.S. government did not veto the U.N. resolution. The letter, which was released on Sunday, stated, “This resolution, which is intended to entice the PLO back to the negotiation table, will in fact create serious obstacles in the peace process” by raising “false and unrealistic expectations on the part of the Palestinians regarding the future of Jerusalem. “The people of Israel will refuse to support any move that raises doubts as to the status of Jerusalem as the united capital of the State of Israel. “As mayor of Jerusalem, and on behalf of all Jerusalemites, I have to express to you my deep disappointment that you did not instruct (U.N.) Ambassador (Madeleine) Albright to prevent the adoption of this resolution,” the letter said. The resolution, which was passed Friday — three weeks after the mass murder of at least 29 Palestinians at a Hebron mosque — criticized the killings, called for measures to guarantee that Palestinians be protected in the future and for the speedy implementation of the self-rule accord signed last September in Washington. But the resolution’s preamble contained language regarding Jerusalem that Jewish leaders found impossible to swallow. Within hours of the resolution’s passage, condemnation of the resolution’s language was issued by leading Jewish organizations, including the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council, B’nai B’rith, the Zionist Organization of America and the American Zionist Movement. FINDING A COMPROMISE FORMULA Referring to “territories occupied by Israel in June 1967, including Jerusalem,” the preamble’s avowal that Jerusalem was occupied territory flew in the face of a prime dictum of the Israeli and American Jewish leadership — that Jerusalem is the eternal and undivided capital of Israel. In a compromise formula worked out before the resolution came to a vote, the United States was able to abstain on this and another paragraph of the preamble while being able to approve the resolution as a whole. In addition to abstaining on the paragraph about the status of Jerusalem, the United States abstained on a second paragraph that said the Hebron attack “underlines the need to provide protection and security for the Palestinian people.” That language could be construed as lending support to the Palestine Liberation Organization’s demand that an international force be sent to the territories to protect Palestinians. A paragraph in the main body of the resolution, which the United States supported, called for an international presence in the territories, “which was provided for in the declaration of principles” that formed the basis of the Palestinian self-rule accord. Israeli officials have supported the idea of an unarmed international presence in the territories, stressing that this was a point already negotiated in the declaration of principles, which was signed in Washington in September. While the United States twice abstained during the voting, the 14 other members of the Security Council voted for every paragraph in the resolution. During their negotiations leading up to the Security Council vote, American officials had operated on the belief that passage of the resolution was key to restarting the Israeli-PLO negotiations, which were halted by the PLO after the Hebron murders. DO ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS? And indeed, the U.S. approach did bear fruit. Following the resolution’s passage, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced at a hastily called news conference that Syria, Jordan and Lebanon had agreed to return to Washington next month to resume negotiations with Israel. U.S. officials also believed that the PLO would now resume negotiations. The three Arab states, like the PLO, had broken off the talks following the Feb. 25 Hebron incident. But in its strategy at the United Nations, the United States had adopted an ends-justifies-the-means approach toward the resolution — a tactic sharply attacked not only by the American Jewish leadership but also by members of Congress. A day before the vote on the resolution, Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) and Connie Mack (R-Fla.) circulated a letter criticizing the Clinton administration’s handling of the resolution. The letter, which was signed by 83 of the 100 members of the Senate, said in part, “Sacrificing core principles for short-term objectives will ultimately retard, not advance the peace process.” And shortly after the passage of Resolution 280, Jewish groups provided their verdict on the day’s Security Council proceedings. The Conference of Presidents said in a statement that the “preamble’s reference to Jerusalem as occupied territory is couched in objectionable, offensive and inappropriate language and a cause for deep regret and disappointment. “No U.N. resolution can diminish 3,000 years of Jewish history, with Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,” the statement read. A similar response was issued by AIPAC. “We regret that the administration abstained on the section of the resolution pertaining to Jerusalem because the pro-Israel community, an over-whelming bipartisan majority of Congress and the president himself have consistently maintained that Jerusalem is, and always should be, the eternal, undivided capital of Israel,” AIPAC said in its statement. Lynn Lyss, chair of the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council, issued a statement saying that the organization was “extremely disappointed” that the preamble referred to Jerusalem as occupied territory, but went on to support the “overall thrust” of the resolution’s condemnation of the Hebron killings and its call for a speedy resumption of the Israeli-PLO dialogue. Melvin Salberg and Abraham Foxman, the national chairman and national director, respectively, of the ADL, said they were “disappointed that the United States failed to veto on principle” the resolution because of its language on Jerusalem. But “we are reassured by the (Clinton) administration’s strong disavowal of that language,” the ADL leaders said in their statement. “We urge the administration to publicly reaffirm its longstanding support for Jerusalem as the united and undivided capital of Israel.” Reps. Charles Schumer and Nita Lowey, both of whom are New York Democrats, also criticized the resolution. ‘A DOUBLE STANDARD’ Schumer questioned why a similar resolution was not introduced before the Security Council regarding the killings of Israelis by Arab terrorists. Resolution 280 “proves once again the United Nations’ bias against Israel and its lack of credibility in dealing with the Middle East even handedly.” “There’s a double standard when the U.N. can’t wait to condemn Israel, but remains silent when Jewish blood is shed at the hands of Arab terrorists, as has been the case during the many months of the current peace effort,” Schumer said in a statement. Lowey said that “this administration has made a major mistake by caving in to (PLO Chairman Yasser) Arafat. The United States should have vetoed this one-sided resolution.” The Clinton administration, expecting harsh fallout from critics of the resolution, has been hard at work on damage control. In a conference call with leaders of the 50 member organizations of the Conference of Presidents, before the Security Council vote Friday, Vice President Al Gore reaffirmed the administration’s position recognizing a united Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Asserting that a U.S. veto might have prevented the peace talks from resuming, Gore explained that the United States would have exercised its veto if the reference to Jerusalem had been in an operative paragraph of the resolution rather than in its preamble. Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, expressed a similar view before the Security Council on Friday. “The United States supports the operative paragraphs of the resolution that the council has just adopted,” she said. “But let me make it clear — we would have exercised our veto” had the language on Jerusalem been in the resolution’s operative paragraphs. “We simply do not support the description of the territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 war as occupied Palestinian territory,” Albright said. “In the view of my government, this language could be taken to indicate sovereignty — a matter which both Israel and the PLO have agreed must be decided in negotiations on the final status of the territories.” (Contributing to this report was JTA correspondent Michele Chabin in Jerusalem.)

Israel will participate in the Security Council debate on the West Bank scheduled to begin tomorrow morning despite the presence of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

The Israeli Embassy in Washington stressed today that Israel’s participation in the debate “does not represent a change of attitude toward the PLO.” Embassy spokesman Avi Pazner declared that “Israel will participate in Security Council debates whenever the need arises.” Pazner’s statement came in response to queries why Israel was prepared to enter tomorrow’s debate with the PLO as a participant when it boycotted the Security Council’s debate on the Mideast in January because of the PLO presence. Israeli sources in Washington told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that Israel did not take part in the January debate because the Council was dealing with the Middle East problem and the Palestinian question as a whole. The sources also said that the debate was a clear attempt by Syria, acting at the behest of the Soviet Union, to transfer the scene of the Mideast negotiations from the Geneva Conference to the Security Council. The refusal of Israel to participate was meant to underline Israel’s opposition to such a move. This time, the sources noted, Israel is participating to defend itself against false allegations regarding Jerusalem and the occupied territory. PAKISTAN, LIBYA REQUESTED MEETING Pakistan and Libya requested the Council meeting after a meeting of the Islamic countries here which scored a decision by a Jerusalem magistrate which released several young Jews who had been arrested for praying on the Temple Mount. Despite the ruling the Israeli government is still enforcing the ban, approved by the Israeli Supreme Court, on Jews praying on the Temple Mount which houses two Moslem mosques. The Pakistan-Libya request said the Magistrate’s ruling “must be seen, along with recent expropriations of Arab-owned land in Jerusalem and the establishment of Jewish settlements in Arab areas, as part of a policy of absorbing occupied Jerusalem into Israel and changing its cultural and demographic character.” The Temple Mount incident sparked weeks of demonstrations, sometimes violent, by Arab youths in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.

Scranton told a press conference that the United States was unalterably opposed to last year’s General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism. Nevertheless, the U.S. wanted to work well with the Arab countries, he said. “I think you will find I am very open and ready to work with the Arab countries, as I have always been.” Scranton said he was a strong believer in his predecessor, Daniel P. Moynihan, and a supporter of Moynihan’s enthusiasms. “I am not the same kind of person and I do not pretend to be,” he said, “but it does not mean we have disagreements about basic American policy. I feel very strongly that when America is attacked at the UN or anywhere else, it should be defended strongly. I intend to do that.” Scranton then added, “At the same time, I do not think there is a basic underlying reason for a confrontation between the U.S. and the Third World.”

The United States will not take the floor at the main UN human rights forum on Monday during the annual debate on violations committed in the Palestinian territories, as part of a previous agreement not to speak, a move praised by sources in Jerusalem. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The European Union, however, reiterated "the urgency of renewed, structured and substantial efforts towards peace". UN session (Photo: AFP) "The US delegation will not be speaking about Palestine today," a US spokesman in Geneva told Reuters in response to a query as the debate began. A senior source in the Foreign Ministry rejected the Reuters report, saying that "every year there is an awful session that singles out Israel – Agenda Item 7. Every year we ask our friends not to speak. The US spokesperson said they would not and that led to a wrong and misleading report." The source said that "Israel praises the United States for its decision. This is a continuation of Kerry's speech from two weeks ago, which condemned the council for singling Israel out and reiterating American support for Israel." Asked to explain why the United States was not taking part, a spokesman told AFP only that the US ambassador to the council Keith Harper was in Washington. The last time that Washington spoke under that stand-alone agenda item was in March 2013, UN records show. The decision not to talk since then was part of an agreement in October 2013 when Israel resumed participation in the UN Human Rights Council. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's allies acknowledged on Sunday that his election-eve disavowal of a Palestinian state had caused a rift with the White House, but blamed US President Barack Obama's unprecedented criticism on a misunderstanding.

News article:
The US refrained from speaking at a United Nations discussion of violations of human rights in the Palestinian territories Monday, saying the move was done in support of Israel. A statement by US Ambassador Keith Harper to the Human Rights Council in Geneva confirmed an Israeli claim that the US silence was meant to back Jerusalem against the historically anti-Israel panel, and not as a result of tensions between US president Barack Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as had been reported. “Our non-participation in this debate underscores our position that Item 7 lacks legitimacy, as it did last year when we also refrained from speaking,” Harper said. “The United States’ approach to the Human Rights Council’s Item 7 has not changed. We remain deeply troubled, by this Council’s stand-alone agenda item directed against Israel, and by the many repetitive and one-sided resolutions under that agenda item.” The session was an annual review of Agenda item 7, which discusses accusations against Israel for alleged abuses against Palestinians, and is usually used by countries as a soapbox against Israel. The US’s policy for several years has been to boycott the debate, a move praised by Israel, which also does not take part. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “As was the case last year, the United States will not engage in the debate. Neither will Israel,” Harper said. The US traditionally defends Israel at the UN and its constituent bodies from international censure. However, officials have indicated Washington may pull back that umbrella in response to anger at Netanyahu for statements he made last week in which he seemed to take a two-state solution with the Palestinians off the table. Earlier Monday, an American spokesperson in Geneva told Reuters that “the US delegation will not be speaking about Palestine today,” which was taken as a sign of deteriorating ties with Israel. Reuters has since updated its story. Advertisement The move was reported by Reuters to be part of Obama’s “reassessment” of Washington’s approach to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process in light of Netanyahu’s pre-election comments rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state. But an Israeli Foreign Ministry source categorically denied the thrust of the Reuters report. Spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said the American delegation was not present at the debate “at Israel’s request.” He said that Jerusalem asked its friends to stay away from such debates every year. Jerusalem had quit the Human Rights Council in 2012 to protest its alleged anti-Israel bias. Late in 2013, Israel rejoined the body, after Western member states promised to admit the country into the Western European and Others Group (WEOG), which significantly increases Jerusalem’s ability to advance its interests at the body. In addition, the WEOG states agreed not to participate in discussions over Agenda item 7 for two years. “Reuters took the statement by the [American] spokesperson and misinterpreted it to mean that it was a response by the Obama administration to the elections in Israel,” he said. “The report is untrue. Every year, the Americans stay away from this debate, which singles Israel out for censure, at Israel’s request.” Advertisement Israel’s delegation to the Geneva-based UN body also refused to appear at the debate about the state of human rights in the Palestinian territories. Israel provided no immediate explanation for not being present at the session dedicated overwhelmingly to discussion of its policies and alleged abuses, but a source close to the council said its absence clearly amounted to a boycott. Monday’s session had originally been scheduled to discuss a probe on the 50-day war in Gaza last year, but the investigators obtained a delay after the head of the team quit under Israeli pressure. “The process cannot be rushed,” former New York judge Mary McGowan Davis, who has taken over as head of the team, told the council. Canadian international law expert William Schabas resigned as chair of the Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza conflict last month after Israel complained he could not be impartial because he had prepared a legal opinion for the Palestine Liberation Organization in October 2012. Schabas strongly denied that he was beholden to the PLO but said he was reluctantly stepping down to avoid the inquiry into the July-August conflict — commissioned by the UN Human Rights Council — being compromised in any away. AFP contributed to this report.

News article:
Against the strenuous opposition of the Soviet Union, which once more resorted to an anti-Jewish attack directed specifically against the chief delegate of the United States, Morris B. Abram, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights voted here last night in favor of the formation of a new office, to be called the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The vote on the issue, following a day-long debate which made a night meeting necessary, was 20 to 7, with two abstentions. The United States, Britain and Israel were with the majority. The Soviet bloc in the Commission, consisting of the USSR, Poland and the Ukraine teamed up with Yugoslavia, Iraq, India and Egypt in the opposition. France and Nigeria abstained. There are 32 members on the Commission. The Commission’s vote culminated a long fight led by the United States and Israel. The Commission’s resolution was in the form of a recommendation to its parent body, the Economic and Social Council which, in turn, must approve the move then forward it to the General Assembly for final action. In the course of the debate, Yakub A. Ostrovski, chief of the USSR delegation, once more attacked Mr. Abram, as he did in the discussion Tuesday, linking Mr. Abram’s attitude on the issue to the fact the latter, in a private capacity, is president of the American Jewish Committee. Insinuating that Mr. Abram “was obeying the orders of the Zionists and the Jews of America,” and charging that the chairman of the American delegation was “serving two masters,” Mr. Ostrovski called the American Jewish Committee “a Zionist organization.” IRAQI DELEGATE ATTACKS ISRAEL FOR SUPPORTING HUMAN RIGHTS Replying very briefly to Mr. Ostrovski’s hour-long diatribe, Mr. Abram merely noted that, in the 20 years of the Commission’s existence, no similar incident had occurred, and no reference had ever been made by a delegate to another delegate’s religious affiliation. “Moreover, Mr. Abram noted, that reference was “irrelevant to the Commission’s work.” The Russian was not the only delegate who brought up the Jewish issue during the debate. The Iraqi delegate, in a 45-minute speech, took out against Israel’s member on the Commission, Supreme Court Justice Haim H. Cohn who, yesterday, had endorsed the High Commission proposal warmly. Iraq’s delegation head chided the Israeli for supporting human rights and the protection of minorities in other countries while the Arab minority in Israel was being “suppressed.” Justice Cohn, whose intervention on the issue had been supported by Italy and Argentina, replied that “in contrast with some other countries, my Government pledges that Israel would admit a High Commissioner for Human Rights and allow him to see whatever he wanted to see and could pledge that we would listen carefully to his advice.” At the night session, the American point of view was pressed by another member of the U.S. delegation, Roger W. Tuby, who said that the High Commissioner would help “to lessen abuses committed on racial, religious or other grounds.” The idea for the establishment of a United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights was first broached publicly by Jacob Blaustein, honorary president of the American Jewish Committee, in an address at Columbia University, in New York, on December 4, 1963. Later, the matter began taking form and, in 1966, Costa Rica proposed that the Human Rights Commission form a special working group to study the matter. As a result, a nine-member group was formed and met at U.N. Headquarters in New York earlier this year. The working group adopted a set of guiding principles for a High Commissioner who, as a global ombudsman, would be the U.N.’s human rights watchdog. The group, however, left open, for the full Commission’s determination, the basic question as to whether or not such a post as High Commissioner for Human Rights was to be created. Last night’s vote on the issue brought the matter further along toward possible enactment.

News article:
Two Republican Congressmen led off a sharp attack on the Administration today because of United States support for the United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israel for its attack on terrorist bases inside Jordan. The debate in Congress proceeded as Jewish organizations protested what they called the one-sided UN action. Rep. Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said in the House today that the UN resolution was “both an unfair slap at Israel and a setback for peace generally in the Middle East.” He warned that the UN resolution would give Arab terrorists “moral support to continue to destroy life and property inside Israel” and represented “a diplomatic victory in the Middle East arena for the Soviet Union.” He said that “too often in the past, the United States has fallen back to a stance of neutrality in the Mideast, a non-position that has helped the Soviet Union make inroads. Now is the time for realism before it is too late.” Rep. Seymour Halpern of New York told the House that the Administration’s support of the resolution censuring Israel “made a mockery of all the pious talk about the necessity of displaying firmness and willpower to deter terrorism and aggression in Vietnam.” He said the resolution gave the terrorists “a sort of privileged sanctuary from which they can sally forth and spread havoc into Israel.” He accused the Administration of “a lack of will power and resolve” in going along on the resolution and noted that “Israel has certainly as much right to defend her territory against guerrilla terrorism as we have to defend South Vietnam.” RABIN SAYS ISRAEL WILL NOT TAKE DICTATION FROM JORDAN OR TERRORISTS Israel Ambassador Yitzhak Rabin, the former Chief of Staff, referred to the Security Council resolution and statements made in the Council debate, when he addressed the Rabbinical Assembly last night at Kiamesha Lake. He warned Jordan that neither it nor the terrorists it is harboring “will dictate to us how to react or in what proportion.” He commented that while “today we are talking about Jordan, the same holds true for any of our neighbors who fail to maintain the cease-fire resolution of the Security Council.” The triennial convention of B’nai B’rith Women adopted a resolution deploring the Security Council resolution that condemned Israel in a manner that “unfairly gave way to the Soviet-Arab bloc.” The resolution “pointed out that the Council had denounced Israel without condemning in sharper terms the “wanton killing by Arab terrorists which provoked the Israeli retaliation.” (In Long Beach, N.Y., the national convention of the United Zionists Revisionists of America adopted a resolution criticizing the United States for supporting the Security Council resolution condemning Israel. The Zionist group said the United States had played into the hands of the Soviet Union and it warned that the Council resolution would deprive Israel of its legitimate right of self-defence and would embolden the Arabs to escalate their terrorist activities. (In Paris, Andre Francois-Poncet, a prominent French diplomat and former Ambassador to Germany, denounced the Security Council’s resolution. Writing in the newspaper, Le Figaro, Mr. Poncet said “we may wonder if good sense has disappeared and if we are not living in the wrong world.”)

He warned Jordan that neither it nor the terrorists it is harboring “will dictate to us how to react or in what proportion.” He commented that while “today we are talking about Jordan, the same holds true for any of our neighbors who fail to maintain the cease-fire resolution of the Security Council.” The triennial convention of B’nai B’rith Women adopted a resolution deploring the Security Council resolution that condemned Israel in a manner that “unfairly gave way to the Soviet-Arab bloc.” The resolution “pointed out that the Council had denounced Israel without condemning in sharper terms the “wanton killing by Arab terrorists which provoked the Israeli retaliation.” (In Long Beach, N.Y., the national convention of the United Zionists Revisionists of America adopted a resolution criticizing the United States for supporting the Security Council resolution condemning Israel. The Zionist group said the United States had played into the hands of the Soviet Union and it warned that the Council resolution would deprive Israel of its legitimate right of self-defence and would embolden the Arabs to escalate their terrorist activities. (In Paris, Andre Francois-Poncet, a prominent French diplomat and former Ambassador to Germany, denounced the Security Council’s resolution. Writing in the newspaper, Le Figaro, Mr. Poncet said “we may wonder if good sense has disappeared and if we are not living in the wrong world.”)

Problems concerning the tension between the Arab countries and Israel were discussed today at a secret session of the Near Eastern Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, No information was given out on the decisions taken at the meeting nor on the exchange of views that took place. Arthur Z. Gardiner, the State Department’s top advisor on Palestine affairs, reported on the Arab-Israel crisis. The State Department today continued to refrain from making any statement on the discussions now taking place between the United States, Britain and France on the next step to be taken jointly by the Big Three to ease the Arab-Israel tension. It is understood that the U.S. Government is delaying action on bringing the Israel-Jordan issue before the United Nations Security Council because Soviet delegate Andrei Vishinsky is the April chairman of the Security Council and might veto any constructive resolution. It was learned that pressure has been brought to bear on the Department not only by Israel but by the Arab League as well as the British for immediate UN action. Israel Minister Plenipotentiary Reuven Shiloah returned to Israel today for consultations at the Foreign Office in connection with the current crisis. (Despite the heightened tension between Israel and Jordan, particularly in the Jerusalem area, the regular Israeli fortnightly relief and supply convoy made its way through the Arab Legion lines to the Hebrew University and Hadassah Hospital grounds atop Mt. Scopus in Jerusalem late yesterday.)

News article:
Major General Carl C. von Horn, Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, told the Security Council here today that Israel’s 11-year-old boycott of the Syrian-Israel Mixed Armistice Commission has “greatly weakened” his authority and is “inconsistent” with the objectives of the Syrian-Israel Armistice Agreement of 1949. He cited a Council resolution, adopted in 1951, to bolster his accusation. Israel has been boycotting the Mixed Armistice Commission since 1951. General von Horn’s statement on the MAC was part of a supplementary report on the current Syrian-Israeli situation, in which he replied in writing to questions asked of him at yesterday’s Council session dealing with the Israeli and Syrian charges and counter-charges of aggression. In his answers, he also accused both Syria and Israel of denying “freedom of movement” to the UN military observers in the demilitarized zone along the Lake Tiberias shore opposite Israel. The Council, which met today for the purpose of hearing General von Horn’s replies to specific queries, adjourned after a 20-minute session and will reconvene tomorrow morning after all participants have had the opportunity to study the UNTSO chief’s supplementary report. ISRAEL PLACES DRAFT RESOLUTION BEFORE SECURITY COUNCIL Meanwhile, as the session opened, Israel placed formally before the Council a draft resolution, which would express the Council’s “grave concern” over “the attacks by Syrian armed forces against citizens and territory of Israel.” In presenting the document formally, Michael S. Comay, chairman of the Israel Delegation here, had altered the draft somewhat from a proposal for a resolution which he placed before the Council yesterday as a “tentative suggestion.” In yesterday’s version Mr. Comay had asked the Council to “condemn” Syria instead of merely voicing “grave concern.” The rest of the Israeli draft, however, is harsher than the previous suggestions. The draft would have the Council not only express “grave concern” but would also call upon Syria to abide fully by all the provisions of the General Armistice Agreement, and in particular, to prevent all illegal crossings from Syrian territory, to cease all interference with Israel activities on Lake Tiberias, and to desist from firing into Israel territory. No member of the Council today made any comment whatever, publicly, either about the Israel resolution or about the Von Horn report. While a large section of General von Horn’s new statement concerned itself with the Mixed Armistice Commission, he also made these points: “No fortified position” on the Syrian side where Israel’s military forces staged the March 17 raid which preceded the current Syrian and Israeli complaints, was seen by the UN military observers as “existing or destroyed.”

At an emergency meeting of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations held today under the chairmanship of Louis H. Weinstein, president of the National Community Relations Advisory Council, the following statement was unanimously adopted: “We express our disappointment and concern at the resolution of the United Nations Security Council of April 9th, censuring Israel for self-defensive measures against Syria. This resolution, regrettably sponsored by our government, failed to reflect the facts of persistent Syrian provocations, the declared Arab objective of liquidating Israel, and continuous threats to the citizens of Israel and to its territorial integrity. We find almost incomprehensible this failure to distinguish between acts of aggression and self-defense. “Peace in the Middle East, as elsewhere in the world, has long been a declared objective of United States policy. Pursuant to that policy, our government has maintained long-standing and firm friendship with Israel and with the Arab states. In our view, the Security Council resolution may very well encourage further acts of aggression by the Arab states instead of promoting peace. “The role of the United Nations is to help achieve the goal of peace everywhere in the world. To attain that goal, we express the hope that our government will use its power and prestige, and its position of moral and political leadership in the free world, to make it indisputably clear that continued acts of Arab belligerency will not be tolerated in the community of nations.” Associated with these views are the following organizations: American Israel Public Affairs Committee, American Jewish Congress, American Zionist Council, American Trade Union Council for Labor Israel, B’nai B’rith, Hadassah, Jewish Agency for Israel, Jewish Labor Committee, Jewish War Veterans of the United States, Labor Zionist Movement, Mizrachi-Hapoel Hamizrachi, National Community Relations Advisory Council, National Council of Jewish Women, National Council of Young Israel, Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, Union of American Hebrew Congregations, United Synagogue of America, Zionist Organization of America.

News article:
A 15-year-old Palestinian died from Israeli gunfire during nighttime skirmishes along the Israel-Gaza border, the Strip's Health Ministry said. Saif A-Din Abu Zaied was wounded in the head Wednesday and died at a hospital, the ministry said early Thursday. The circumstances were not immediately known, but the incident occurred as dozens of youths engaged in “nighttime confusion,” a more violent form of protests involving firebombs and laser lights directed at Israeli forces along the border fence. Open gallery view Saif A-Din Abu Zaied. The night skirmishes are complementary to the weekly daytime protests that Gaza’s Hamas rulers have staged for a year. >> Read more: Hamas seeks concessions from Israel before escalating conflict ■ Hidden messages on TV: How Hamas recruited West Bank Palestinians for terror attacks Israeli warplanes carried out intensive airstrikes on the southern Gaza Strip early on Thursday in response to balloons carrying explosives and a rocket being fired across the border into Israel, the Israeli army said. Israeli warplanes fired six missiles aimed at military facilities belonging to the Hamas movement and the Islamic Jihad in the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis, Al-Quds Radio reported, quoting security officials and eyewitnesses. The Israeli military confirmed on Twitter that "fighter jets and aircraft struck several military targets in a Hamas compound in Gaza." No injuries were reported, but the facilities were destroyed and nearby houses were also damaged, Al-Quds said. The IDF added that it held Hamas accountable for the cross-border attacks, which it said hit an empty area in southern Israel. No damage or injuries were reported and no one had yet claimed responsibility for firing the rocket. Every night since February, Palestinian young men known as the "night disturbance unit" have been gathering by the border with Israel as part of the "Marches of Return" protests, which began in late March last year. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have taken part in the demonstrations, demanding Palestinians be allowed to return to what is now Israel. At the end of February, UN investigators said there is evidence pointing to crimes against humanity by Israeli security forces who shot, injured and killed Palestinians during the massive protests last year. A UN Commission of Inquiry consisting of independent human rights experts counted 189 killed and estimated more than 9,000 injured Palestinians. Other counts put the number of Palestinian victims at 260 and the injured in excess of 26,000. One Israeli soldier was killed by a Palestinian sniper and four others were injured during the demonstrations, the UN report said. The experts acknowledged that some demonstrators were members of armed groups and that the protest organizers, which included militants from the Hamas movement, encouraged the use of incendiary kites and balloons, causing extensive damage and fear in southern Israel. However, it only found two incidents, one in May and one in October, when Israeli forces actually faced imminent threats to their lives and were therefore within their rights in using live ammunition. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the report, saying that it "is setting new records of hypocrisy and lies, out of an obsessive hatred of Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East."

About 190 Palestinians have been killed during the protests. A United Nations independent commission of inquiry recently published its preliminary report stating that it had collected evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity by Israel which has used lethal military force against unarmed protesters. “[Israeli forces] have intentionally shot children, they’ve intentionally shot people with disabilities, they’ve intentionally shot journalists, knowing them to be children, people with disabilities and journalists,” Sara Hossain, one of the investigators appointed by the UN Human Rights Council, said. The report calls for the individuals responsible to face international sanctions and arrest. “Israeli forces caused permanent disabilities to many of the 940 children shot during the demonstrations,” the UN report states. Five Palestinian children have died after being struck by tear gas canisters since the start of 2018, according to Defense for Children International Palestine. Israel killed 60 Palestinian children in 2018. Targeting journalists and media organizations Israel also targets journalists during the protests, but its war on Palestinian media continues outside that context as well. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the Hamas-affiliated al-Aqsa TV channel a “terrorist organization” on Wednesday. Al Mezan, a human rights group based in Gaza, condemned Netanyahu’s decision as “a dangerous precedent.” “Occupation forces target journalists, employees of the press and media institutions systematically,” Al Mezan stated. Israeli forces have killed 18 journalists or media workers since the start of the second intifada in 2000, according to Al Mezan. The Israeli military has attacked 32 media organizations as well. This includes bombing al-Aqsa TV buildings and killing its journalists in Gaza. In November, an Israeli airstrike targeted the headquarters of al-Aqsa TV, which is located in a heavily populated area of Gaza City. The Committee to Protect Journalists has rejected Israel’s assertions that al-Aqsa TV’s links with Hamas make it a legitimate military target. This claim “has no basis in international law,” CPJ stated. “Journalists, like all civilians, only lose their protected status if they directly take part in hostilities.” Al Mezan warned that Israel’s designation of al-Aqsa TV as a “terrorist” organization could escalate Israel’s attacks on Palestinian journalists and media. Israeli forces have killed two Palestinian journalists covering the Great March of Return protests and injured many others. An Israeli sniper fatally wounded journalist Yaser Murtaja, who was wearing a flak jacket marked with the word PRESS on 6 April last year. A week later journalist Ahmad Abu Hussein died of injuries sustained while covering protests. In December, photographer Mohammed Asad, a regular contributor to The Electronic Intifada, narrowly escaped a similar fate. The fragment of a bullet fired by an Israeli sniper destroyed his camera but left him physically unscathed. But that same bullet had hit 16-year-old Muhammad al-Jahjouh in the neck, killing him.

News article:
A Palestinian man wounded by Israeli security forces in clashes along the Gaza border last month succumbed to his injuries on Monday, the enclave’s health ministry said. Bassem Osman Safi, 22, died from his wounds after being injured during a weekly border protest east of Khan Younis on February 22, ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said on Twitter. Reports in Palestinian media said Safi was hit in the head with a tear gas canister. The restive Gaza border has seen increasingly intense bouts of violence in recent days, with Israel carrying out airstrikes in response to explosives tied to balloons launched from the Palestinian territory. Amid the heightened tensions, the southern town of Netivot planned to test its air raid sirens at 10:05 on Monday morning. Residents of the area were told that in the case of an actual attack the alarm system would sound twice.

A day earlier, Israeli jets bombed Hamas targets in Gaza after Palestinian terrorists in Gaza fired a mortar shell at Eshkol. The army said the early-morning strikes were in response to the mortar attack the previous night, as well as “continuing terror activities from the Strip, including balloon explosives and causing harm to security infrastructure in the last several days.” As tensions between the sides continue to simmer, Gazans have also been launching balloon-borne bombs at Israel and firing small arms across the border, along with holding near-daily protests and riots at the fence, in which fire bombs are thrown at troops and Palestinians attempt to damage the barriers, according to the army. Advertisement Israel has carried out perfunctory air raids after each balloon or mortar attack, usually hitting empty military posts maintained by the Hamas terror group, which is the de facto ruler in the Strip. The uptick of violence comes after several months of relative calm thanks to a hard-won ceasefire brokered by Egypt. Egypt and other mediators have been working intensively in recent weeks to broker a new ceasefire agreement between the two sides, but thus far to no avail. On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Hamas that Israel would not hesitate to launch a large-scale military operation in Gaza, vowing his government would do whatever necessary to restore calm to southern communities. At the start to the weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu warned Hamas that it should not assume that Israel would not respond to the recent attacks because of Israel’s approaching elections. “I heard people from Gaza saying that since we are in an election campaign a wide-ranging operation is out of the question,” he said. “I suggest to Hamas – don’t count on it. We will do everything necessary to restore security and quiet to the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip and to the south in general.” Judah Ari Gross contributed to this report.

News article:
A Palestinian protester waves a flag near burning tyres during clashes with Israeli forces after a demonstration at the border with Israel, east of Gaza City A Palestinian was killed and more than 40 others wounded by Israeli fire Friday in renewed protests and clashes along the Gaza border, the enclave's health ministry said. Tamer Arafat, 23, died from his wounds after being shot in the head, ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said. Qudra said earlier that overall at least 42 Palestinians had been wounded by Israeli gunfire during the 50th week of demonstrations. Four medics were among those hurt, the ministry said. An Israeli army spokesman said "approximately 8,400 demonstrators and rioters are currently gathered in a number of locations along the Gaza Strip security fence". "They have hurled explosive devices and rocks at the security fence and soldiers, and have also ignited tyres," the spokesman said. Troops responded according to "standard operating procedures", he added. The Israeli military on Friday evening reported the launch of a projectile from the Gaza Strip into its territory. Protests and clashes began along the Gaza border on March 30 last year. Demonstrators have been calling for Palestinian refugees and their descendants to be allowed to return to former homes now inside Israel, which Israeli officials say is akin to calling for the Jewish state's destruction. Israel accuses Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas of using the demonstrations as cover for infiltrations and attacks, while rights groups and Palestinians say protesters posing little threat have been shot by Israeli snipers. At least 253 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since March 2018, the majority shot during weekly border protests and others hit by tank fire or air strikes in response to violence from Gaza. Two Israeli soldiers have been killed over the same period. Israel and Hamas, which has controlled the blockaded Gaza Strip for over a decade, have fought three wars since 2008. There has been an increase in violence over the past week as Israel has repeatedly struck Hamas positions in response to what it said were balloon-borne "explosive devices" floated across the border.

Two Palestinians were killed by Israeli live gunfire on Friday during protest along the Gaza border fence, the health ministry in the Strip reported, adding two more were critically wounded. One of the men was shot in the chest while protesting east of the El Bureij refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip, the report said, and stated 55 other Palestinians were wounded in the clashes thus far. Haaretz Weekly, Episode 19 Credit: Haaretz The health ministry later released the names of the two men killed, Nedal Abed Alkareem Ahmed Shatat, 29, and 24-year-old Jehad Monier Khaled Harara. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was present in the area of the protest, said, "The marches of return are a tool of resistance to the siege on Gaza, and a clear statement that the Palestinian people haven't given up on their right of return." Open gallery view Balloons carrying a make-shift drone-shaped object, set loose by Palestinian protesters during a protest by the border with Israel, Gaza City, March 22, 2019.

On Thursday, the Israeli military said it shelled a Hamas military post in the southern Gaza Strip in response to incendiary balloons being flown over the border fence. Seven Palestinians were reported wounded by Gaza's health ministry. Last week, the organizing committee for the March of Return called off the weekly protest after a serious flare-up, throughout which the IDF attacked some 100 targets in Gaza following two rockets that were fired at Tel Aviv. Next Friday, March 30, is the anniversary of the "March of Return." It marks Land Day, a day Palestinians worldwide have commemorated since 1976, when Israeli security forces shot dead six Israeli-Arabs protesting land expropriation.

(MENAFN- Kuwait News Agency (KUNA)) GAZA, March 22 (KUNA) -- At least two Palestinian people were killed and 55 others wounded by the Israeli army's fire on Friday during the Marches of Return and Breaking the Israeli Siege along the eastern borders of Gaza Strip, Palestinian Health Ministry said. Some 55 people were injured by the Israeli forces which also fired tear gas on the medical teams, wounding some of paramedics and damaging some ambulances, the ministry's spokesman Ashraf Al-Qedra said in a statement. Thousands of Palestinian people took part in the 51st Friday of the return marches along the Strip's eastern border, despite threats by the Israeli army. The Israeli army deployed additional forces in the early hours of this morning to suppress marchers. For its part, the High Commission for Return and Breaking the Siege called on Palestinian people to take part in a million-man march on March 30 to mark the Land Day. Palestinian people have been staging marches for nearly a year calling for meeting their demands, including their return to their homes and lifting the siege imposed on the Strip. More than 260 Palestinians have been martyred so far and over 30,000 others injured in the marches. (end) wab.hm MENAFN2203201900710000ID1098291305

News article:
A Palestinian was killed by Israeli fire in the Gaza Strip early Sunday, authorities in the territory said, during overnight riots that also saw many explosive devices hurled at IDF troops across the border fence. The 24-year-old man was fatally shot in the chest and two others were wounded, the Hamas-run health ministry said. There was no immediate comment or confirmation by the army. Also during the night, Israeli military aircraft bombed Hamas targets in Gaza after a rocket alarm sounded in some Israeli communities bordering the strip, triggered by an improvised bomb thrown at the border. The Israel Defense Forces said aircraft struck two Hamas reconnaissance posts in response to “the multitude of explosive devices that were thrown and exploded during the night.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Nighttime riots in Gaza have been led by so-called “confusion units” organized by the Hamas terror group, the Strip’s de facto ruler. On Saturday, the units said they would step up activities, with a week of nightly riots from 7 p.m. until dawn along the border and more airborne incendiary devices launched into Israel. It said the move was in response to the deaths of two Palestinians shot by troops during border riots Friday. During the nightly demonstrations, participants regularly set off loud explosives or sounds grenades, burn tires and throw rocks at Israeli troops on the other side of the security fence. Israeli soldiers typically respond with tear gas and, in some cases, live fire. Advertisement On Saturday, Israeli military aircraft launched a pair of strikes at Palestinian cells flying incendiary balloons from the southern Gaza Strip into Israel, the army said. Four Palestinians were injured in the strikes. On Friday, several thousand Palestinians took part in violent protests on the Gaza-Israel border, throwing explosive devices and rocks at Israeli soldiers who responded with tear gas and occasional live fire. Recent weeks have seen an uptick of incendiary balloons launched from the coastal enclave, after a drop-off in attacks following an unofficial truce between Israel and Hamas in November. The launch of incendiary and explosive devices into Israel tied to kites and helium-filled balloons became a common tactic in violent protests along the Gaza border over the past year, burning thousands of acres of farmland and nature reserves, and killing livestock and other animals. There are fears that violence will ramp up this week, with Hamas hoping to draw hundreds of thousands of rioters to the fence at the weekend to mark a year of so-called March of Return protests. Israel says the demonstrations are orchestrated by Hamas, which vocally supports them, sending free buses to the border and providing food and internet to participants — as well as money for those injured in them — in order to provide a cover for the organization’s nefarious activities along the security fence, including infiltration attempts, the planting of explosives and attacks on Israeli soldiers. An Islamist terror group, Hamas seeks to destroy Israel. Advertisement Their organizers have said the protests aim to achieve the “return” of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to lands that are now part of Israel, and pressure the Jewish state to lift its restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out of the coastal enclave. Israeli officials hold that the return of Palestinian refugees and their descendants would destroy Israel’s Jewish character. They also maintain that the restrictions on movement are in place to prevent Hamas and other terrorist groups from smuggling weapons into the Strip. The sides are said to be engaged in Egyptian mediated ceasefire talks.

In an update from an earlier report, in which IMEMC reported that 2 Palestinians were wounded by Israeli gunfire on Friday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health has now reported that 11 Palestinian protesters were wounded, including one who was shot in the chest in a protest east of Rafah, in southern Gaza. Additionally, on Friday evening, Israeli forces fired two shells at a building in Juhr ad-Deek area southeast of Gaza City, causing damage to the building. updated from: 800 Palestinians protest at Gaza border; two shot in the legs as Israel amasses tanks Mar 29, 2019 @ 22:56 Two Palestinians were moderately injured by Israeli gunfire Friday at protests on the eastern border of the Gaza Strip. The protests were smaller than the usual weekly protests have been, as Palestinians in Gaza gear up for major protests on Saturday to commemorate the 43rd Palestinian Land Day. It was Land Day 2018 that sparked the weekly protest movement known as the Great March of Return, which has taken place every week since March 30, 2018, and has resulted in the deaths of nearly 200 Palestinian protesters shot by Israeli sharpshooters, and the serious injuries of more than 11,000, according to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights. Friday’s protests took place in four locations along the eastern border of Gaza, with Israeli tanks and troops lined up on the other side of the border. The troops and tanks have been amassing there since Monday, apparently planning for a land invasion of Gaza to accompany the airstrikes that have been ongoing all week, and have destroyed at least thirty buildings, including high rise apartment and office buildings. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two Palestinians were moderately wounded in their legs with live gunfire from Israeli snipers. The injuries took place at the protest east of Jabaliya, in the northern part of the West Bank. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from all over Gaza are expected to participate in the Land Day protests on Saturday, and Palestinian leaders have urged the Israeli military to show restraint and to stop their practice of indiscriminately firing live ammunition toward the unarmed protesters, as they have done every week since the protests began one year ago.

(MENAFN- Gulf Times) Four Palestinian demonstrators have been killed and more than 300 injured in clashes with the Israeli army on the Gaza border since Friday night, the Gaza Health Ministry said yesterday. Violence erupted between demonstrators and Israeli soldiers stationed on the Israel-Gaza border, as tens of thousands demonstrated to mark the one-year anniversary of the Great March of Return protests. The Israeli army, which put the number of protesters at 40,000, accused participants of throwing rocks and setting tyres on fire. In addition, a number of grenades and explosive devices were hurled at the border fence, it said. Witnesses said Israeli soldiers fired tear gas and live gunfire at the demonstrators to keep them from approaching the fence. The Israeli army warned Gazans not to approach the fence during the protests, calling on them to keep a distance of 300m away. The army said that troops had fired "in accordance with standard operating procedures." Hundreds of Palestinian men, some from Hamas, were deployed in bright orange vests to deter people from going near the fence. There was also less acrid black smoke swirling around with little sign of tyre-burning, as on previous weekends. The Gazan Health Ministry said yesterday evening that at least 316 Palestinians had been injured. Of those, 64 sustained gunshots wounds. Others were hurt by shrapnel, exposure to tear gas or being hit by tear gas canisters. The Great March of Return protests, which have been taking place every week since they began a year ago, call for the right of return of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to the territory of today's Israel, as well as for an end to the 12-year-long blockade imposed by Israel. A general strike was held in the Gaza Strip and the Health Ministry and Interior Ministry declared a state of emergency. Governmental and private sector institutions were closed, including schools, universities and stores all in the Gaza Strip, except medical institutions, clinics and hospitals. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, 269 Palestinians have been killed and thousands injured in the protests since they started one year ago. The anniversary coincides with Land Day, which commemorates the death of six Arab Israelis who were killed by Israeli forces during protests against the expropriation of land by Israel in 1976. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement: "The suffering of our people over 100 years and the enormous sacrifices made by this great people will not go to waste." Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, said the day had "lots of rioters but significantly less violence", adding that it showed Hamas was able to stop violence when it wanted to. But many protesters still managed to get near the border and throw stones at Israeli soldiers.

The Israeli army warned Gazans not to approach the fence during the protests, calling on them to keep a distance of 300m away. The army said that troops had fired "in accordance with standard operating procedures." Hundreds of Palestinian men, some from Hamas, were deployed in bright orange vests to deter people from going near the fence. There was also less acrid black smoke swirling around with little sign of tyre-burning, as on previous weekends. The Gazan Health Ministry said yesterday evening that at least 316 Palestinians had been injured. Of those, 64 sustained gunshots wounds. Others were hurt by shrapnel, exposure to tear gas or being hit by tear gas canisters. The Great March of Return protests, which have been taking place every week since they began a year ago, call for the right of return of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to the territory of today's Israel, as well as for an end to the 12-year-long blockade imposed by Israel. A general strike was held in the Gaza Strip and the Health Ministry and Interior Ministry declared a state of emergency. Governmental and private sector institutions were closed, including schools, universities and stores all in the Gaza Strip, except medical institutions, clinics and hospitals. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, 269 Palestinians have been killed and thousands injured in the protests since they started one year ago. The anniversary coincides with Land Day, which commemorates the death of six Arab Israelis who were killed by Israeli forces during protests against the expropriation of land by Israel in 1976. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement: "The suffering of our people over 100 years and the enormous sacrifices made by this great people will not go to waste." Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, said the day had "lots of rioters but significantly less violence", adding that it showed Hamas was able to stop violence when it wanted to. But many protesters still managed to get near the border and throw stones at Israeli soldiers.

Israel and Russia agreed on a mechanism to avoid military confrontations between the two countries in Syria, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday after a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. “My goal was to prevent misunderstandings between IDF forces and Russian forces. We have established a mechanism to prevent such misunderstandings. This is very important for Israel’s security,” Netanyahu told Israeli reporters during a telephone briefing from the Russian capital. “Our conversation was dedicated to the complex security situation on the northern border,” the prime minister said. “I explained our policies in different ways to try to thwart the deadly weapons transfers from the Syrian army to Hezbollah — action actually undertaken under the supervision of Iran.” Netanyahu said that he told Putin in “no uncertain terms” that Israel will not tolerate Tehran’s efforts to arm Israel’s enemies in the region, and that Jerusalem has taken and will continue to take action against any such attempts. “This is our right and also our duty. There were no objections to our rights and to what I said. On the contrary: there was readiness to make sure that whatever Russia’s intentions for Syria, Russia will not be a partner in extreme actions by Iran against us.” Ahead of their meeting, as they made statements to the press, Netanyahu told Putin that Iran and Syria have been arming Hezbollah with advanced weapons, thousands of which are directed at Israeli cities. “At the same time, Iran, under the auspices of the Syrian army, is attempting to build a second terrorist front against us from the Golan Heights.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The prime minister told his Russian host that Israel’s policy is to prevent these weapons transfers “and to prevent the creation of a terrorist front and attacks on us from the Golan Heights.” Netanyahu came to the Kremlin to “clarify our policies, and to make sure that there is no misunderstanding between our forces,” he said. Putin replied by saying that the Syrian army was too bogged down in its own civil war to deal with fighting against Israel. “All of Russia’s actions in the region will always be very responsible,” Putin said. “We are aware of the shelling against Israel and we condemn all such shelling. I know that these shellings are carried out by internal elements. In regard to Syria, we know that the Syrian army is in a situation such that it is incapable of opening a new front. Our main goal is to defend the Syrian state. However, I understand your concern.” Advertisement He also said he remains mindful that many émigrés from the former Soviet Union live in Israel, which “has a special effect on our bilateral relations.”

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss Moscow's weapon deliveries to Syria. The leaders focused on how to keep their armed forces out of each other's way. At a meeting in Moscow on Monday, Netanyahu and Putin decided they would coordinate their military actions in Syria to avoid accidentally trading fire. "My objective was to prevent misunderstandings between IDF [Israel Defense Forces] units and Russian forces," Netanyahu told reporters, adding that he and Putin had "agreed on a mechanism" to prevent such events. Earlier, the Israeli prime minister had said it was important to remove misunderstandings between the two countries forces. Israeli planes have, on occasion, bombed neighboring Syria after suspecting Assad's forces of delivering weapons to the anti-Israeli Hezbollah, which is based in neighboring Lebanon and has Iran's support. Iran in turn, with the help of the Syrian army, was "trying to set up a second terrorist front on Golan Heights," which was captured by Israel in 1981, Netanyahu told diplomats in Moscow. Russia's 'responsible' role in Syria Putin rejected Netanyahu's concerns of Assad's forces opening up a second front. "We know that the Syrian army and Syria as a whole are in such a state that they have no time for a second front. They need to save their own state," the Russian president said, adding that he "understood" Israel's concerns. Moscow's actions in the Middle East "always were and will be very responsible," Putin stressed. The two leaders were also due to discuss the stalled peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was arriving in Moscow on Wednesday, the Kremlin said in a statement. Israel captured Golan Heights from Syria in 1981 Image: Reuters/B. Ratner Moscow to tie up with Assad? Last week, satellite images were released showing Russian tanks, armored vehicles and other military equipment arriving in Syria's Latakia province, a stronghold of President Bashar Assad's forces. The US had earlier reported a Russian military buildup in the Middle Eastern country. Moscow has dismissed US concerns, saying it has been reinforcing Assad's military to fight the "Islamic State" (IS). Its leaders have also been involved in diplomatic efforts to try and make US forces against the IS join hands with President Assad. Israel opposes Assad's regime, but has largely avoided being dragged into the Syrian conflict. However, following the international nuclear deal with Iran, Netanyahu is afraid that military aid in Latakia, on Israel's northeastern border, may embolden anti-Israeli groups like the Lebanon-based Hezbollah. The group, in turn, is supported by Iran, which has been a growing threat for Israel ever since western powers signed a nuclear deal lifting economic sanctions on Teheran. mg/msh (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)

News article:
Russia’s president and Israeli’s PM have agreed to “establish a channel for information exchange” with regard to the current situation in war-torn Syria, a Kremlin spokesman said on Tuesday, commenting on the Netanyahu’s visit to Moscow. The two discussed the need for a “more honest information exchange and coordination between Russia and Israel” in their actions in Syria, Vladimir Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov said, adding that the agreement had been prompted by the worsening situation there. “Based on the partnership relations between Russia and Israel it has been considered appropriate to establish channels of informational exchange on such a sensitive issue,” Peskov told journalists, adding that this coordination has become necessary because of the difficult situation in the region, and has nothing to do with Russian military advisers in Syria. The Kremlin’s comments came after Benjamin Netanyahu said that his meeting with Putin on Monday was intended to “prevent misunderstandings between IDF (Israel Defense Forces) units and Russian forces” in Syria. Briefing Israeli reporters after the talks, Netanyahu said that they had “agreed on a mechanism” to ensure that such “misunderstandings” do not happen, without elaborating further. Following the statements, some anonymous sources told the Israeli press that the goal of such coordination was to avoid situations in Syria in which the Russian and Israeli military could find themselves accidentally trading fire. The coordination will apply to “air, naval and electromagnetic fields,” RIA Novosti reported citing a source in Israeli military. Neither country is directly involved in the Syrian conflict. Moscow has been supplying Syria with arms on a regular basis for years under previous contracts, and Israel has kept its distance from the war, with the exception of several reportedly “preventive airstrikes.” (RT.com)

News article:
Russia informed Israel ahead of its Wednesday airstrikes — the first it carried out in Syria — targeting rebel strongholds there, Israeli officials said.

News article:
The Russian government gave Israel advanced notice of its airstrikes in Syria Wednesday, the Jerusalem Post reported. Russian President Vladimir Putin received the support of his country's parliament Wednesday to launch the strikes in Syria only two days after addressing the U.N. and meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama. Israel said it did not receive information on where the strikes would be launched and Israel’s defense minister Moshe Ya’alon said Tuesday that Israel “doesn’t coordinate our operations with Russia.” Both U.S. and French officials said Wednesday that the airstrikes targeted the city of Homs, an area that is not a stronghold of the terrorist group the Islamic State, prompting concerns that Russian strikes were aimed at supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad by hitting opposition forces. Israeli officials met with their Russian counterparts in Moscow last week to discuss the situation in Syria. The Israel Defense Forces have a working group with the Russian military to coordinate their actions in Syria, the Jerusalem Post reported. Israel has struck targets in the past within Syria, causing Assad to call the rebels fighting against his government “servants of Israel.” "The real tools that Israel is using, which are more important than the recent attacks, they are the terrorists in Syria," Assad said in an August interview. "If we want to deal with Israel, we must first deal with its proxies inside Syria.” Putin spoke at the U.N. General Assembly Monday and called on world leaders to form a coalition to fight terrorism. The Russian leader has continued to support Assad, while Obama has called for his removal. Just now: @JohnKerry spoke on #Syria counterterrorism efforts at UN Security Council mtg hosted by #Russia FM Lavrov http://t.co/9H3WZKWLSW — Department of State (@StateDept) September 30, 2015 "We should finally acknowledge that no one but President Assad is truly fighting the Islamic State," Putin said. The civil war in Syria began in 2011 and has taken the lives of 200,000 people and displaced millions. The Russian government admitted earlier this month to sending military advisors and supplies to Syria.

The big losers are the US, its Arab and Western allies, and Israel, despite reports that Russia informed Washington and Jerusalem in advance of its air missions. Yet regardless what Israeli officials say, they will not be able to conceal the fact that Israel's previous unstoppable freedom of action and maneuverability in Syria is now restricted. A gun placed on stage in the first act must be fired by the last one. This axiom is attributed to Russian playwright Anton Chekov - the same one whose work Minister of Culture Miri Regev proudly declared she has never read.Even though it was clear that the extensive military buildup by the Russia Army in Syria was bound to eventually lead to military intervention in the civil war, the first Russian air strikes yesterday were received with a bit of surprise. Yesterday morning the Russia Duma (parliament) approved the use of military force - as if President Vladimir Putin really needed their approval - and yesterday by noon missions were executed near the towns of Homs, Hama, and Latakiya. According to Western sources, the Russians targeted positions of rebel groups opposing the regime of President Bashar Assad, including factions supported by the US. The Russian Ministry of Defense, on the other hand, said that its air force targeted ISIS.Nevertheless, one can assume that Russia is trying to create a division of labor that is not to the liking of the US and its Arab and Western coalition partners assembled to fight on two fronts: the Assad regime and Islamic State.The Russian logic is that the US-led coalition will attack ISIS and Russia will attack the rest of the rebel groups. Regardless of whether such a division will be in place de facto, one conclusion is emerging: the big winner of the new situation is Assad and his failed regime.There are already indications that his self-confidence is growing due to the newly formed supportive coalition of Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah and partially the Iraqi government to save his neck.Really? If so, then why did Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself travel with the chief of staff and head of military intelligence to meet in Moscow two weeks ago? And why is the deputy chief of staff traveling next week to meet with his Russian counterpart? Of course, to have talks on "deconfliction" to avoid accidental clashes between Israel and the Russia armies.It doesn't mean necessarily that the IDF will not be able to respond in the future - as it did earlier this week to shells or rockets mistakenly or intentionally launched from Syria or to prevent terrorist attempts to penetrate the Golan Heights.Yet the question of what Putin's real goals are and what his grand strategy in Syria is, if he has one, puzzles Israeli and Western experts. All of them agree, however, that on the surface it seems that Putin hopes to achieve the following aims: to help Assad to consolidate his regime, even if it means allowing him to control only his "little Syria" fiefdom - or by a different name his "Alawaitestan;" to ensure Russian access to warm water ports in the Mediterranean; to safeguard Russia's last bastion and stronghold (Syria) in the Middle East; to enable Putin to conduct a confrontational foreign policy against the US; to leverage Syria as a bargaining chip for Russia to enhance agreements across the board - Ukraine versus Syria, for example - between world powers and to divide parts of the world to spheres of influence and interest, as it used to be during the cold war era; to contain ISIS - Putin may not care that the Islamic State controls chunks of Syria and Iraq, but he doesn't want it to advance in the direction of his back yard - the former Soviet- Muslim republic in Central Asia; to avoid sending "boots on the ground" to fight in Syria - for this purpose Putin has Hezbollah, Syrian and even Iranian- sponsored Shiite mercenaries to be used as cannon folder.Despite being an authoritative ruler, he doesn't want Russians to be returned in body bags to military funerals across Russia. He knows the lessons of the Soviet-era war in Afghanistan.From all of the above, it is also clear that the bloody civil war that has already caused the death of more than 250,000 Syrians will be prolonged because of Russian involvement, at least in the short term. Still, one should not rule out the possibility that in the long run Russia's entry may enhance the chance of a political-diplomatic settlement in which Assad will remain in power for a transition period and eventually step down.Against the background of negative ramifications on Israel's security posture, there is a possible positive side, although it is not politically correct to express it: the continuation of the war benefits Israel by enhancing its standing as an unmatched regional power, while Hezbollah and Iran are weakened by their involvement.

News article:
Russia Israel military coordination talks on Syria to open Tuesday (MENAFN- The Peninsula)Russian President Vladimir Putin right listens to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during their meeting at the Bocharov Ruchei residence in the Black Sea resort of Sochi Russia Tuesday May 14 2013. JERUSALEM: A senior Russian military delegation will visit Israel on Tuesday for two days of talks on how the countries can avoid accidentally clashing while operating in Syria an Israeli military officer said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on Sept. 21 to set up teams as Moscow steps up military support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad who has been losing ground to an Islamist-led insurgency. Israel is worried the Russian deployment which includes advanced anti-aircraft units and warplanes risks pitting Russian forces against its own over Syria. Israel has attacked Syrian armed forces and arch-foe Lebanese Hezbollah a Damascus ally during the four-year civil war in its hostile neighbour. It has said it holds the Syrian government responsible for any spillover of violence. On Sept. 27 Israel struck Syrian army targets on the Golan Heights in retaliation for cross-border rocket fire. In August it waged its heaviest bombardment since the conflict began killing Palestinian militants in response to cross-border fire. The Russian delegation will be led by First Deputy Chief of General Staff General Nikolai Bogdanovsky who will meet his Israeli counterpart Deputy Chief of Staff Major-General Yair Golan. "The two will meet at military command headquarters in Tel Aviv as part of the two-day visit of the Russian army delegation to Israel. Among other matters they will discuss regional coordination issues" the Israeli officer said on Monday. After Putin and Netanyahu met an Israeli military officer who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters the countries would focus on aerial operations in Syria and "electromagnetic coordination". The latter appeared to refer to the sides agreeing not to scramble each other's radio communications or radar-tracking systems and devising ways of identifying each other's forces to avoid any unintended confrontation in the heat of battle. Israel and Russia will also coordinate on sea operations off Syria's Mediterranean coast where Moscow has a major naval base the Israeli officer said. In explaining Israel's objectives in coordination with the Russians Netanyahu told CNN in an interview on Sunday: "I went to Moscow to make it clear that we should avoid a clash between Russian forces and Israeli forces." "In Syria I've defined my goals. They're to protect the security of my people and my country. Russia has different goals. But they shouldn't clash" he said. When asked by Reuters about the talks an official at the Russian embassy in Israel declined to comment. Reuters

Baku, Azerbaijan, Oct.7 By Anakhanum Khidayatova - Trend: Russia won't make compromise regarding the Syrian issue either with the US or Turkey, Yaakov Kedmi, diplomat, former head of Israel's 'Nativ' intelligence agency exclusively told Trend Oct.7. "The complicated relations between Russia and Turkey are full of contradictions," he said. "Both countries have common problems with Europe, as well as common economic interests, but Turkey is a NATO member." Russia supports Syrian's President Bashar al-Assad, sympathizes with Kurds, and speaks for secular Syria, said Kedmi, adding that meanwhile, Turkey pursues its own interests in Syria. Nevertheless, both Turkey and Russia want to have influence on Syria, according to the Israeli diplomat. The expert also touched upon the recent incident related to the violation of Turkey's airspace by Russian aircraft. Turkey's Foreign Ministry said that the planes of Russian air forces, involved in the military operation in Syria, violated Turkey's airspace on Oct. 3. The aircraft of Turkish air forces carried out warning sorties following the violation of the country's airspace. After this Russian planes left the Turkish airspace. Following the incident, Russian ambassador to Turkey was summoned to the country's Foreign Ministry to clarify the situation. "Despite Russia's apologies, Turkey strongly reacted to the unintended (for a few seconds) violation of its airspace by Russian aircraft," said Kedmi. In fact, Russia closed the Syrian airspace for Turkish air raids over the districts densely populated by Kurds as well, he added. The expert said that the further development of relations between Moscow and Ankara will depend on Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his ability to act logically and within his country's interests, but not impulsively. --- Follow the author on Twitter: @Anahanum

AMMAN — Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi and Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation's (PLO) executive committee, on Monday stressed the unified Jordanian-Palestinian stance on the Palestinian cause. This stance emphasises that the only road to comprehensive peace is one that meets all the Palestinians’ legitimate rights, foremost of which is the right of the Palestinian people to freedom and an independant Palestinian state along the June 4, 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, the two officials said. According to a Foreign Ministry statement, Safadi and Erekat reaffirmed the cohesion of Jordanian-Palestinian efforts that seek to protect Jerusalem’s Muslim and Christian holy sites. “The protection of Muslim and Christian holy sites is a priority under the patronage of His Majesty King Abdullah, who has devoted everything at the Kingdom’s disposal to preserve Jerusalem’s Arab, Muslim and Christian identities, its holy sites and their historical and legal status quo,” Safadi reiterated. Safadi and Erekat also reviewed the latest developments in relation to the Bab Al Rahmah (Gate of Mercy) building at Al Aqsa Mosque and the efforts being made to protect it as an integral part of Al Aqsa Mosque/Al Haram Al Sharif. The foreign minister stressed Jordan’s utter rejection of the Israeli court’s decision to close Bab Al Rahmah and any steps taken in attempt to change its legal and historical status. He added that Jordan does not recognise the legitimacy of the Israeli court in East Jerusalem, pointing out that the Jerusalem Awqaf Department is the only authority with jurisdiction to manage Al Haram Al Sharif in accordance with international law, according to the statement. Erekat expressed his appreciation, on behalf of the Palestinian state, for the “King’s efforts, as the patron of Christian and Muslim holy sites, in protecting the Arab-Islamic identity of Jerusalem’s holy sites, and his efforts to protect Bab Al Rahmah to preserve its historical status”. Furthermore, Safadi and Erekat agreed to continue coordination and negotiation in fulfilment of the King and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ directives. They highlighted the importance of maintaining cooperation between Jordan and Palestine in pursuit of a peace that restores the rights of the Palestinians to freedom and statehood, in accordance with a two-state solution, international legislation and the Arab Peace Initiative, the statement added.

News article:
(MENAFN- Jordan Times) The meeting between Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi and Secretary General of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation's Executive Committee Saeb Erekat on Monday was convened at the right time, given the stalemate in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the recent wave of Israeli provocations in East Jerusalem against Islamic holy sites, including the attempt to close the Bab Al Rahmah (Gate of Mercy) of Al Aqsa Mosque. The two officials used the strongest words possible to describe the identical views of the two sides on the Palestinian case, which call for the right of the Palestinian people to freedom and an independent Palestinian state along the June 4, 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The Palestinian recognition and support for the Hashemite Custodianship over the Islamic and Christian holy places in East Jerusalem was also highlighted as a pivotal point in their agreement on the East Jerusalem. It is, after all, on the strength and legitimacy of this Jordanian custodianship over the holy sites in East Jerusalem, including Al Aqsa Mosque and its Bab al Rahmah, that Jordan was able to defend their Islamic status from Israeli encroachments, and reject any Israeli court decisions on them as a clear violation of international law and UN resolutions. It is only the Jerusalem Awqaf Department, the two sides emphasised, that has the sole authority to determine the status of any part or entrance belonging to these Islamic sites. The unity of ranks between Jordan and the Palestinian Authority (PA) is what reinforces and lends support to the role of Jordan as the protector of the holy places in East Jerusalem and the final arbiter of their status. As long as Jordan and the PA see eye to eye on what counts most with regard to East Jerusalem, the Holy City and its shrines will be in safe hands and their protection from any Israeli attempt to change their status will be thwarted. This comes as no surprise, as what unites the Palestinians and the Jordanians goes back several decades, and nothing will succeed in dividing their ranks. That said, there is now a pressing need for an Arab and or an Islamic summit on East Jerusalem to discuss the latest developments. Now that Israel has decided to up the ante on the holy sites in East Jerusalem, the Arab and Muslim world need to react in a united front. The stakes in East Jerusalem and its Islamic and Christian holy places are now too high to be dealt with casually or routinely. A united Arab and Muslim front have become urgently needed.

(MENAFN- Jordan Times) The meeting between Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi and Secretary General of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation's Executive Committee Saeb Erekat on Monday was convened at the right time, given the stalemate in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the recent wave of Israeli provocations in East Jerusalem against Islamic holy sites, including the attempt to close the Bab Al Rahmah (Gate of Mercy) of Al Aqsa Mosque. The two officials used the strongest words possible to describe the identical views of the two sides on the Palestinian case, which call for the right of the Palestinian people to freedom and an independent Palestinian state along the June 4, 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The Palestinian recognition and support for the Hashemite Custodianship over the Islamic and Christian holy places in East Jerusalem was also highlighted as a pivotal point in their agreement on the East Jerusalem. It is, after all, on the strength and legitimacy of this Jordanian custodianship over the holy sites in East Jerusalem, including Al Aqsa Mosque and its Bab al Rahmah, that Jordan was able to defend their Islamic status from Israeli encroachments, and reject any Israeli court decisions on them as a clear violation of international law and UN resolutions. It is only the Jerusalem Awqaf Department, the two sides emphasised, that has the sole authority to determine the status of any part or entrance belonging to these Islamic sites. The unity of ranks between Jordan and the Palestinian Authority (PA) is what reinforces and lends support to the role of Jordan as the protector of the holy places in East Jerusalem and the final arbiter of their status. As long as Jordan and the PA see eye to eye on what counts most with regard to East Jerusalem, the Holy City and its shrines will be in safe hands and their protection from any Israeli attempt to change their status will be thwarted. This comes as no surprise, as what unites the Palestinians and the Jordanians goes back several decades, and nothing will succeed in dividing their ranks. That said, there is now a pressing need for an Arab and or an Islamic summit on East Jerusalem to discuss the latest developments. Now that Israel has decided to up the ante on the holy sites in East Jerusalem, the Arab and Muslim world need to react in a united front. The stakes in East Jerusalem and its Islamic and Christian holy places are now too high to be dealt with casually or routinely. A united Arab and Muslim front have become urgently needed.

His Majesty King Abdullah chose Zarqa to make momentous declarations, especially on East Jerusalem and its Muslim and Christian holy places. Zarqa is a major metropolitan urban city in Jordan that is home to about 50 per cent of the country’s industries and businesses. But that was not what the King had in mind when he spoke up about Jerusalem and its holy places. At a time when many countries, including some Arab states, are silent on the Israeli threats to the Islamic holy places, including Al Aqsa Mosque, the King chose to keep the torch of Jerusalem burning, hoping that the silent nations would wake up one day and speak up on the fate of the Muslim and Christian religious sites. The Zarqa declarations did not come, therefore, from a vacuum. The Hashemite Custodianship over the holy sites in East Jerusalem is a firm and unshaken conviction that no side can derail or question. That is what the King wanted to say in Zarqa loud and clear. East Jerusalem is a red line, said the King, that no side can cross with impunity. “No one can pressure Jordan on this matter, and the answer will be no. All Jordanians stand with me on Jerusalem. At the end of the day, Arabs and Muslims will stand with us as well,” the King said. The Jordanian custodianship over these holy sites is also a red line that the King will uphold at all costs. “All my people are with me,” the King added. His Majesty did not fail to add that he remains sanguine about the future, despite all the odds that the country faces, which undermine its stability and progress. Some countries, the King said, were actually applying pressure on his steadfastness on East Jerusalem, but he reiterated that he will not waver. Jordan’s stance on East Jerusalem and its holy places is a matter of principle and not a subject for negotiation. Well, the King has spoken loud and clear and it is up to the rest of the shareholders to take full note of his firm determination to uphold his custodianship of the holy sites in East Jerusalem, come what may. The King touched upon the so-called allegation that Jordan could be the homeland for the Palestinian people. He stressed that any talk about an “alternative homeland” for Palestinians in Jordan is rejected, noting that “to anyone who speaks about an alternative homeland, the answer is no”. Jordan is Jordan and Palestine is Palestine. This should put an end to those who still market the ridiculous idea that Jordan is the homeland for the Palestinians. Only when the state of Palestine is created on Palestinian soil in the West Bank, with East Jerusalem as it capital, would Jordan consider some form of unification or another. That moment in time has not arrived. That was Jordan’s official position and remains its final word on the subject.

(MENAFN- Jordan Times) AMMAN — His Majesty King Abdullah, the Supreme Commander of the Jordan Armed Forces-Arab Army (JAF), accompanied by HRH Crown Prince Hussein, on Thursday attended a ceremony at the Unknown Soldier Monument in the Jordan Valley to mark the 51st anniversary of the Karameh Battle, according to a Royal Court statement. On March 21, 1968, Jordanian soldiers repelled an Israeli attack on the small Karameh town in the Jordan Valley, whose name means "dignity". Eighty-six Jordanian soldiers lost their lives in the battle and 108 were wounded. The Israeli raid was repelled with heavy losses as the Jordanian army launched an artillery barrage against Israeli tanks. A total of 250 Israeli soldiers were killed and 450 were wounded, according to official sources. A 21-gun salute welcomed His Majesty as he arriving at the ceremony site, where he was received by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lt. Gen. Mahmoud Freihat and other high ranking officers. The King reviewed the guard of honour, laid wreaths at the monument and recited verses from the Koran at the site, according to the statement. Also during the ceremony, JAF Mufti Brig. Gen. Majed Darawsheh paid tribute to the fallen soldiers of the Arab Army. The Supreme Commander and the Crown Prince greeted several Royal family members, Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Omar Razzaz and other senior officials and high ranking officers, the statement said.

(MENAFN- Jordan News Agency) Amman, Mar.26 (Petra) -- His Majesty King Abdullah, the Supreme Commander of the Jordan Armed Forces-Arab Army (JAF), affirmed on Tuesday that "the future of Jerusalem and Palestine is a red line for Jordan". Speaking during a meeting at the JAF General Command, King Abdullah stressed that the position of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and all Jordanians is unwavering on Jerusalem and on any attempts to create an alternative homeland for the Palestinians in Jordan. His Majesty said the decision to cancel his visit to Romania was over Jerusalem. "As I said in Zarqa and as I have continued to say over perhaps the past 15 years Jerusalem and the future of Palestine is a red line for Jordan. I don't know what more I can say to make it clear!" the King said at the meeting, attended by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lt. Gen. Mahmoud Freihat, heads of security agencies, and a number of senior army and security officers. His Majesty criticised those questioning Jordan's unequivocal position, underscoring that "this is the position of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and all Jordanians". The King said his recent remarks in Zarqa on the Hashemite state was directed at those cynics. "As a Hashemite, how can I back down on Jerusalem? Impossible. This is a red line. No on Jerusalem; no to an alternative homeland, no to resettlement [for Palestinians in Jordan]," His Majesty affirmed. The King warned against those who spread negativity and doubts "amongst us as Jordanians, as institutions, and as a state", calling for a national campaign to counter doubters. His Majesty warned against the danger of these campaigns to spread doubts, describing them as ammunition for Jordan's enemies. "How long can this continue?" the King asked. "Those speaking against us and against Jordan are adding fuel to the fire." His Majesty said Jordan is aware of the economic challenges it is facing and working to alleviate poverty and unemployment, warning that doubters must not be given the chance to spread their harm. The King criticised unfounded claims circulated regarding the "deal of the century" or "the alternative homeland". "Don't we have a voice? We are the brave Arab Army. We have a history in Jerusalem and in Palestine. We have a voice and a position," His Majesty affirmed. The King said his tour which starts Wednesday and includes Morocco, Italy, France, and Tunisia, where His Majesty will attend the Arab Summit will focus on Jerusalem and the peace process. During the meeting at the General Command of JAF, His Majesty was also briefed by Assistant to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs for Intelligence Brig. Gen. Nasser Mheirat on the northern and eastern borders. The King also checked on the readiness of JAF formations, commending the advanced level of their personnel in terms of preparedness, armament and training. AF 27/03/2019 00:02:04

(MENAFN- Jordan News Agency) Casablanca, Mar. 28 (Petra)-- His Majesty King Abdullah and King Mohammed VI of Morocco affirmed on Thursday that defending Jerusalem and its holy sites against attempts to change the historical, legal, and political status quo or alter their religious and cultural Islamic and Christian identity is a top priority for Jordan and Morocco. During talks in Casablanca ahead of the Arab Summit in Tunisia, the two leaders stressed their full support for the Palestinian people in restoring their legitimate rights and enabling them to establish an independent Palestinian state on the 4 June 1967 lines with East Jerusalem as its capital, based on international law, relevant UN resolutions, the Arab Peace Initiative, and the two-state solution. King Abdullah and King Mohammed VI reiterated their rejection of all unilateral measures and steps by Israel, the occupying power, to change the legal and historical status quo, the demographics, and the spiritual and historical identity of East Jerusalem, especially at Islamic and Christian holy sites in the city. His Majesty and King Mohammed VI affirmed the importance of the historical Hashemite Custodianship undertaken by King Abdullah over Islamic and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, noting its key role in safeguarding these sites and their Arab, Islamic, and Christian identity, especially Al Aqsa Mosque/Al Haram Al Sharif. The two leaders also noted the role of the Jordanian Jerusalem Awqaf Department as the sole legal authority administering, maintaining, and regulating entry into Al Haram Al Sharif. King Abdullah commended the ongoing efforts by King Mohammed VI, chairman of Al Quds Committee, in solidarity with Jerusalem, praising the initiatives implemented by Bayt Mal Al Qods Asharif Agency, under the Moroccan monarch's supervision, to support the steadfastness of Jerusalemites.

His Majesty King Abdullah receives the 2019 Lamp of Peace award from Sacred Convent Custodian Father Mauro Gambetti (left), in the presence of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (right), on Friday, in Assisi, Italy (Photo courtesy of Royal Court) AMMAN — His Majesty King Abdullah reaffirmed on Friday that “today, nowhere is it more important to act than in safeguarding Jerusalem”. Speaking at a ceremony attended by Her Majesty Queen Rania in Assisi, Italy, after receiving the 2019 Lamp of Peace award for efforts to promote human rights, harmony, interfaith dialogue and peace in the Middle East and the world, King Abdullah noted Jordan’s duty in line with the Hashemite Custodianship of Jerusalem’s Islamic and Christian holy sites, a Royal Court statement said. “As Hashemite Custodian of Jerusalem’s Islamic and Christian holy sites, we are bound by a special, personal duty to the security and future of the Holy City,” His Majesty noted. “Ties of love and concern bind the Holy City to billions of Muslims and Christians around the world, and Jerusalem should be and must be a unifying city of peace,” the King underscored. In his speech, delivered at the Sacred Convent of St. Francis of Assisi, His Majesty also paid tribute to “the suffering families and victims of the terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, two weeks ago” “Such evil, wherever it happens, is our suffering, too,” the King said, asking the attendees — who included German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Italian Episcopal Conference President Gualtiero Bassetti and President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani — to observe a moment of silence for the victims of the New Zealand attack and all victims of hatred. His Majesty accepted the Lamp of Peace award, which recognises global figures for their work towards promoting peace and harmony, “on behalf of all who are working for a better future, and, most especially, on behalf of the people of Jordan, Muslim and Christian alike, who are making sacrifices every day for a better future for all”. Since its launch in 1981, the Lamp of Peace has been awarded to a number of political and religious leaders, including Chancellor Merkel in 2018, former Polish president Lech Wałęsa, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, former Colombian president and Noble Prize Laureate Juan Manuel Santos, Pope Francis, Pope John Paul II, the Dalai Lama and Mother Teresa. The King, who received this year’s award from the Custos of the Sacred Convent of Assisi Father Mauro Gambetti, said Muslims and Christians make up more than half the people on earth. “It has never been more important to come together in harmony,” His Majesty noted. “The principles of coexistence and interfaith harmony are deeply embedded in Jordan’s heritage. Our country is home to a historic Christian community. All our citizens actively share in building our strong nation,” the King said. “And indeed, Christians have been part of Middle East societies for thousands of years and are vital to the future of our region,” His Majesty stressed. “The people of the world do not have to be the same in order to have the same concerns, share the same needs or hope the same hopes. To reach a better future, we must find a common path,” the King said. Noting that “Jordan’s commitment to harmony and peace underlies our international role”, His Majesty highlighted the Kingdom’s role in the fight against terror and hatred on all fronts within a holistic approach, and in seeking effective solutions to global and regional crises. The King also reaffirmed Jordan’s ongoing efforts for a lasting resolution of the region’s core conflict, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, based on the two-state solution. His Majesty concluded the speech with a call for peace and harmony, according to the statement. “Today, all over the world, millions of Muslims are coming together to perform Friday prayers, as those pious Muslims did who came to their mosques in New Zealand two Fridays ago. And today, as every day — five times a day — our prayers are calling for peace,” the King said. “So I ask you to listen to that call. I ask you to help be the lights of peace who create the understanding and hope that our world desperately needs,” His Majesty concluded. In his remarks at the beginning of the ceremony, Sacred Convent Custodian Father Mauro Gambetti commended the King’s efforts in promoting interfaith dialogue and peace. He also lauded His Majesty’s commitment to education reform, protecting religious freedom and offering millions of refugees a safe haven in times of conflict. Father Gambetti referenced His Majesty’s speech at the European Parliament in 2015, quoting him as saying that Islam demands respect and caring for others. Gambetti added that the Islamic greeting is one that wishes peace upon others, which is aligned with what Saint Francis of Assisi drew from the Bible. The Sacred Convent custodian thanked the King for promoting the shared commandments between Islam and Christianity on loving God and loving one’s neighbour. He added that such efforts enhance understanding between all religions and underscore the shared values of peace between them, the statement added. Father Gambetti thanked His Majesty for safeguarding Islamic and Christian holy sites, and called on him to continue his efforts in promoting and enhancing peace and interfaith harmony. Also speaking at the ceremony, Chancellor Merkel commended His Majesty’s efforts in promoting peace and harmony, as well as Jordan’s role in hosting Syrian refugees. Highlighting the refugee burden undertaken by Jordan, Merkel said it is as if Germany were hosting over 5 million refugees, or if Italy were hosting 4 million refugees. She noted that Europeans should always remember what the King has done for refugees, adding that Jordan deserves Europe’s respect, solidarity and support. Chancellor Merkel said the message of interfaith dialogue that His Majesty promotes is one of utmost importance, pointing to “A Common Word” as a historic event in Islamic-Christian relations. She described the King as a role model for people around the world, dubbing him a leader of peace. Jordan, she said, has proven to be a cornerstone for peace in the Middle East, having maintained its safety and stability. She also commended the King’s efforts in the peace process, promoting the two-state solution for the Palestinians and Israelis. The event included a tour of the Sacred Convent of St Francis of Assisi, during which Their Majesties visited the Tomb of Saint Francis and signed the Flag of Peace, according to the statement. His Majesty also signed the guest book at the Sacred Convent.

Speaking at a ceremony attended by Her Majesty Queen Rania in Assisi, Italy, after receiving the 2019 Lamp of Peace award for efforts to promote human rights, harmony, interfaith dialogue and peace in the Middle East and the world, King Abdullah noted Jordan's duty in line with the Hashemite Custodianship of Jerusalem's Islamic and Christian holy sites, a Royal Court statement said. 'As Hashemite Custodian of Jerusalem's Islamic and Christian holy sites, we are bound by a special, personal duty to the security and future of the Holy City,' His Majesty noted. 'Ties of love and concern bind the Holy City to billions of Muslims and Christians around the world, and Jerusalem should be and must be a unifying city of peace,' the King underscored. In his speech, delivered at the Sacred Convent of St. Francis of Assisi, His Majesty also paid tribute to 'the suffering families and victims of the terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, two weeks ago' 'Such evil, wherever it happens, is our suffering, too,' the King said, asking the attendees — who included German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Italian Episcopal Conference President Gualtiero Bassetti and President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani — to observe a moment of silence for the victims of the New Zealand attack and all victims of hatred. His Majesty accepted the Lamp of Peace award, which recognises global figures for their work towards promoting peace and harmony, 'on behalf of all who are working for a better future, and, most especially, on behalf of the people of Jordan, Muslim and Christian alike, who are making sacrifices every day for a better future for all'. Since its launch in 1981, the Lamp of Peace has been awarded to a number of political and religious leaders, including Chancellor Merkel in 2018, former Polish president Lech Wałęsa, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, former Colombian president and Noble Prize Laureate Juan Manuel Santos, Pope Francis, Pope John Paul II, the Dalai Lama and Mother Teresa. The King, who received this year's award from the Custos of the Sacred Convent of Assisi Father Mauro Gambetti, said Muslims and Christians make up more than half the people on earth. 'It has never been more important to come together in harmony,' His Majesty noted. 'The principles of coexistence and interfaith harmony are deeply embedded in Jordan's heritage. Our country is home to a historic Christian community. All our citizens actively share in building our strong nation,' the King said. 'And indeed, Christians have been part of Middle East societies for thousands of years and are vital to the future of our region,' His Majesty stressed. 'The people of the world do not have to be the same in order to have the same concerns, share the same needs or hope the same hopes. To reach a better future, we must find a common path,' the King said. Noting that 'Jordan's commitment to harmony and peace underlies our international role', His Majesty highlighted the Kingdom's role in the fight against terror and hatred on all fronts within a holistic approach, and in seeking effective solutions to global and regional crises. The King also reaffirmed Jordan's ongoing efforts for a lasting resolution of the region's core conflict, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, based on the two-state solution. His Majesty concluded the speech with a call for peace and harmony, according to the statement. 'Today, all over the world, millions of Muslims are coming together to perform Friday prayers, as those pious Muslims did who came to their mosques in New Zealand two Fridays ago. And today, as every day — five times a day — our prayers are calling for peace,' the King said. 'So I ask you to listen to that call. I ask you to help be the lights of peace who create the understanding and hope that our world desperately needs,' His Majesty concluded. In his remarks at the beginning of the ceremony, Sacred Convent Custodian Father Mauro Gambetti commended the King's efforts in promoting interfaith dialogue and peace. He also lauded His Majesty's commitment to education reform, protecting religious freedom and offering millions of refugees a safe haven in times of conflict. Father Gambetti referenced His Majesty's speech at the European Parliament in 2015, quoting him as saying that Islam demands respect and caring for others. Gambetti added that the Islamic greeting is one that wishes peace upon others, which is aligned with what Saint Francis of Assisi drew from the Bible. The Sacred Convent custodian thanked the King for promoting the shared commandments between Islam and Christianity on loving God and loving one's neighbour. He added that such efforts enhance understanding between all religions and underscore the shared values of peace between them, the statement added. Father Gambetti thanked His Majesty for safeguarding Islamic and Christian holy sites, and called on him to continue his efforts in promoting and enhancing peace and interfaith harmony. Also speaking at the ceremony, Chancellor Merkel commended His Majesty's efforts in promoting peace and harmony, as well as Jordan's role in hosting Syrian refugees. Highlighting the refugee burden undertaken by Jordan, Merkel said it is as if Germany were hosting over 5 million refugees, or if Italy were hosting 4 million refugees. She noted that Europeans should always remember what the King has done for refugees, adding that Jordan deserves Europe's respect, solidarity and support. Chancellor Merkel said the message of interfaith dialogue that His Majesty promotes is one of utmost importance, pointing to 'A Common Word' as a historic event in Islamic-Christian relations. She described the King as a role model for people around the world, dubbing him a leader of peace. Jordan, she said, has proven to be a cornerstone for peace in the Middle East, having maintained its safety and stability. She also commended the King's efforts in the peace process, promoting the two-state solution for the Palestinians and Israelis. The event included a tour of the Sacred Convent of St Francis of Assisi, during which Their Majesties visited the Tomb of Saint Francis and signed the Flag of Peace, according to the statement. His Majesty also signed the guest book at the Sacred Convent.

Head of the political bureau of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, yesterday reaffirmed the movement's support for Jordan in the face of "foreign pressures, especially American and Israeli pressure, aimed at changing the region's geopolitics". Haniyeh added that Hamas "will not accept any solution to the Palestinian cause at the expense of Jordan and its sovereignty", stressing that the "deal of the century" targets Palestine, Jordan and the Palestinian refugees. Haniyeh also reiterated the movement's rejection of "settling the Palestinian refugees in their places of residence, especially at the expense of Jordan's sovereignty". Last month, Jordan's King Abdullah II said pressure is being exercised on him personally to change his country's position regarding the occupied city of Jerusalem, adding that he will not change his position and that the Jordanian people stand with him on this issue. READ: Jordan rejects any change to status quo of Jerusalem "We in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan have a historic duty towards Jerusalem and the holy sites there. Jerusalem is a red line, and my people stand with me," he said. Later on March, the king cancelled a planned visit to Romania after the Romanian prime minister pledged to transfer the country's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

People gather at Arab Army Square in Zarqa Governorate for a rally organised by the Zarqa Governorate Council to show support of His Majesty King Abdullah’s recent declarations on Jerusalem and Hashemite Custodianship (Petra photo) AMMAN — Jordanians on Wednesday took to Zarqa’s streets in a show of support for His Majesty King Abdullah’s stances towards Jerusalem. Jordanians marched to Arab Army Square in Zarqa Governorate, 22km northwest of Amman, where they held a rally waving Jordanian flags, the Jordan News Agency, Petra, reported. “Jerusalem is a Red Line,” one of the banners carried during the march read. Others read “No Alternative Homeland”, “Yes for the Hashemite Custodianship over Jerusalem’s Islamic and Christian Holy Sites” and “No Settlement”, according to Petra. Organised by the Zarqa Governorate Council, the rally was designed to show that public stances align with King Abdullah’s positions expressed at international forums, as well as to renew rejections of any solution to the Palestinian cause which comes at the expense of the Kingdom, the president of the council, Ahmad Eleimat said. In solidarity with Jerusalem, King Abdullah previously called off a planned trip to Romania following a pledge by Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dancila to move her country’s embassy in Israel to occupied Jerusalem. The Romanian prime minister recently pledged during a trip to Washington that her country would move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to occupied Jerusalem, breaking with both the EU position and with her own country’s president, according to AFP. Prime Minister Viorica Dancila made the announcement at the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), an influential pro-Israel lobby. Her stance would align Romania with the US position under President Donald Trump, and it came on a day when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was beginning a Washington visit which included an AIPAC appearance and a meeting with Trump.

AMMAN — Secretary General of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation’s Executive Committee Saeb Erekat on Saturday praised His Majesty King Abdullah’s historical stances on Jerusalem and its holy sites and commended His Majesty’s utter rejection for Jerusalem to be the capital of Israel. In an interview with the Jordan News Agency, Petra, Erekat referred to the Jordanian reactions that followed the remarks of Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dancila recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, after which King Abdullah received a statement from Romanian President Klaus Iohannis denying his prime minister’s remarks. The secretary general also praised His Majesty’s cancellation of the visit to Romania, which highlights that “Jerusalem is not up for negotiation to Jordan”. Erekat expressed gratitude and appreciation for His Majesty’s role as the custodian over the Islamic and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, as well as for Jordan’s efforts, through the Awqaf Ministry, in administrating Al Aqsa Mosque/Al Haram Al Sharif and providing all necessary equipment. As for what is dubbed as the “deal of the century”, Erekat said that it is “completely rejected”, describing it as an attempt to bury the Palestinian cause and noting that Israel has already implemented some of its clauses through the expansion of settlements and the recognition of Jerusalem as its capital. He stressed that the Palestinian administration is boycotting all parties that recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and boycotts the US administration as well through a unified national Palestinian stance.

DEAD SEA, Jordan — A senior Jordanian politician has said Jordan hopes Israel’s national elections will produce a new government headed by someone other than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Jordan is one of two Arab countries to maintain formal diplomatic relations with Israel. “Jordan hopes that after these elections, there will be a government led by someone other than Netanyahu, who knows that the only solution to the Palestinian issue is the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital,” Jordanian Senate Speaker Faisal al-Fayez told The Times of Israel over the weekend, on the margins of the World Economic Forum at the Dead Sea in Jordan. “Netanyahu’s position on the Palestinian issue is known. He is not looking to resolve it and I worry that he may want to annex the West Bank in the future.” The Senate is the upper house of the Jordanian parliament, which proposes and approves legislation.

But the prime minister has said in recent days that the Israeli right was in danger of losing its grip on power following the elections. In a video posted to social media, the premier called on voters to “come back home to Likud,” warning that the Blue and White party could “break the right-wing bloc.” Advertisement Gantz, a former IDF chief of staff, has said he believes he will become Israel’s next prime minister. While Gantz has said that Israel should “strive for peace” with the Palestinians, he has not endorsed the establishment of a Palestinian state. The Senate speaker also said he thinks personal ties between Jordanians and Israelis will remain almost nonexistent without a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “We have a peace treaty with Israel and there are official ties,” he said. “But on the popular level, interaction between Jordanians and Israelis is almost zero. The only way this can change is if Israel gives the Palestinian people their rights including to a sovereign, livable and independent state.” While Israel and Jordan signed a peace deal in 1994 and their governments cooperate on security, economic and other issue, contact between Jordanians and Israelis has continued to be very limited.

News article:
Jordan has been experiencing tough days which have led it to the current economic crisis given the absence of any Arab support. Instead, the Arabs' dollars are being set on fire in crushing wars here and there. Moreover, the Arabs and Israel are fighting from the same trench to pressure Jordan to accept the deal of the century. While Arab support is absent, the trade between Jordan and Israel has reduced to 65 per cent of what it was ten years ago. It has become known nowadays that the difficult situation in Jordan is due to its rejection of the deal of the century, an American-Israeli peace project that aims to eliminate and liquidate all issues, including Jerusalem and the refugees. Instead, the agreement seeks to resolve these issues at the expense of the Jordanian identity and interests, and of course, at the expense of the Palestinian people. Jordan is aware that it is engaging in the most difficult and most important confrontation since 1967, and therefore it has rejected all the generous offers it received. Such proposals include paying off its debt for the entire year, amounting to $40 billion in exchange for agreeing to the deal of the century. This is because it will ultimately mean that Jordan is selling Jerusalem, as well as Jordan itself, for this amount, making Jerusalem an Israeli city and Jordan, a homeland for refugees. The Palestinian cause will end with this in the face of the Arab, Israel, and American pressure, which Jordan is forced to confront. Jordan sees no other way of facing such pressure except by making a change, and this change has become apparent in several Jordanian measures over the past few days. The most important of such measures is the signing of several agreements with Qatar in the military and economic fields during a visit by a senior-level Qatari delegation. READ: Islamists make comeback in union elections in Jordan This means that Jordan has indeed begun looking for new allies in the region. Moreover, as of the beginning of 2019, King Abdullah II visited Turkey and met with Erdogan, as well as visited Tunisia, the cradle of the Arab Spring, and met with President Essebsi. He even sent a rare congratulatory telegram to the Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani and visited Iraq, which is the first visit in 10 years. Jordan's most recent notable action occurred on a national level, as King Abdullah II met with Muslim Brotherhood MPs, which is the first meeting between Muslim Brotherhood leaders and the King in over seven years. This move has several implications for the countries pressuring Jordan. Significant developments are occurring in Jordan, which is experiencing a historically important turning point. However, the most significant event has not happened yet, i.e. ending the peace agreement with Israel, known as the Wadi Araba Treaty, completely and withdrawing from it. If the Israelis, along with with the Americans, the mediator and treaty guarantor, want to change the status of Jerusalem and the status of the refugees, then they would be violating the treaty's main clauses. The treaty stipulates that "Israel respects the present special role of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in Muslim Holy shrines in Jerusalem," and "When negotiations on the permanent status will take place, Israel will give high priority to the historic Jordanian role in these shrines." The agreement also clearly states that Jordan must be involved in any solution related to the refugees, as it hosts the largest number of refugees since the Nakba in Palestine in 1948. Jordan's response to the deal of the century should be nothing less than completely withdrawing the peace agreement with Israel, as it cannot continue to adhere to an agreement that does not preserve Jordan's main interests. This along with the continued loss of the economic benefits of this treaty, which means that the deal is gradually losing all economic and political value and benefit.

News article:
Jordan has been experiencing tough days which have led it to the current economic crisis given the absence of any Arab support. Instead, the Arabs' dollars are being set on fire in crushing wars here and there. Moreover, the Arabs and Israel are fighting from the same trench to pressure Jordan to accept the deal of the century. While Arab support is absent, the trade between Jordan and Israel has reduced to 65 per cent of what it was ten years ago. It has become known nowadays that the difficult situation in Jordan is due to its rejection of the deal of the century, an American-Israeli peace project that aims to eliminate and liquidate all issues, including Jerusalem and the refugees. Instead, the agreement seeks to resolve these issues at the expense of the Jordanian identity and interests, and of course, at the expense of the Palestinian people. Jordan is aware that it is engaging in the most difficult and most important confrontation since 1967, and therefore it has rejected all the generous offers it received. Such proposals include paying off its debt for the entire year, amounting to $40 billion in exchange for agreeing to the deal of the century. This is because it will ultimately mean that Jordan is selling Jerusalem, as well as Jordan itself, for this amount, making Jerusalem an Israeli city and Jordan, a homeland for refugees. The Palestinian cause will end with this in the face of the Arab, Israel, and American pressure, which Jordan is forced to confront. Jordan sees no other way of facing such pressure except by making a change, and this change has become apparent in several Jordanian measures over the past few days. The most important of such measures is the signing of several agreements with Qatar in the military and economic fields during a visit by a senior-level Qatari delegation. READ: Islamists make comeback in union elections in Jordan This means that Jordan has indeed begun looking for new allies in the region. Moreover, as of the beginning of 2019, King Abdullah II visited Turkey and met with Erdogan, as well as visited Tunisia, the cradle of the Arab Spring, and met with President Essebsi. He even sent a rare congratulatory telegram to the Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani and visited Iraq, which is the first visit in 10 years. Jordan's most recent notable action occurred on a national level, as King Abdullah II met with Muslim Brotherhood MPs, which is the first meeting between Muslim Brotherhood leaders and the King in over seven years. This move has several implications for the countries pressuring Jordan. Significant developments are occurring in Jordan, which is experiencing a historically important turning point. However, the most significant event has not happened yet, i.e. ending the peace agreement with Israel, known as the Wadi Araba Treaty, completely and withdrawing from it. If the Israelis, along with with the Americans, the mediator and treaty guarantor, want to change the status of Jerusalem and the status of the refugees, then they would be violating the treaty's main clauses. The treaty stipulates that "Israel respects the present special role of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in Muslim Holy shrines in Jerusalem," and "When negotiations on the permanent status will take place, Israel will give high priority to the historic Jordanian role in these shrines."

Jordan's response to the deal of the century should be nothing less than completely withdrawing the peace agreement with Israel, as it cannot continue to adhere to an agreement that does not preserve Jordan's main interests.

This refers to the letter ‘Loyalty trumps competence’ (April 22) by Dr Najeeb A Khan. The writer has praised the appointment of Abdul Hafeez Shaikh as the new head of the finance ministry but criticized other appointments within the cabinet in the reshuffle. The newly inducted adviser to the PM on finance is an IMF preference, having had close ties with the IMF and other key international institutions controlled by the US and its Western allies. With Pakistan on the wrong side of the US and its partners India and Israel in the present geopolitical situation, the nation is not going to have smooth sailing with the IMF. Unfortunately, former finance minister Asad Umar blundered in not taking bold decisions and focusing on home-grown measures soon after assuming office, and put all eggs in one basket. His inexperience in handling public finance and economy as well as ignorance of the prevailing geopolitical situation cost him dearly. He failed in building a robust team and continued to work with Ishaq Dar era officials in the Ministry of Finance, FBR, State Bank, SECP etc. Having an abrasive personality, he failed to listen to saner voices in the country who were advising against seeking IMF crutches.

However, India maintains that Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran, where he had business interests after retiring from the Navy. India had recently approached the International Court of Justice, calling the Jadhav affair an "egregious" Pakistani violation of the provisions of the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Addressing a joint press conference with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the end of his two-day trip (21-22 April) to Tehran, Pakistan's Prime Minister had said, "I know Iran has suffered from terrorism (perpetrated) by groups operating from Pakistan. We (need to) have trust in each other that both countries will not allow any terrorist activity from their soil. We hope this will build confidence between us."

Khurrum Dastigir, a senior leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) attacked Khan, saying the Prime Minister's statement threatens national security, as for the first time he has admitted the use of (the country's) soil for terrorism in Iran, according to a report in Pakistan's Daily Times. Pakistan Peoples Party leader and former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar said that the statement was not funny anymore, alluding to a faux pas in which Khan had referred to Japan when talking about Germany's relations with its European neighbours. "You cannot play with the future of the country anymore. This was not a slip of the tongue. The prime minister has distorted both geography and history for all of us." The Prime Minister's office added that Imran Khan has clearly stated during his visit to Iran that terrorists have been using Afghanistan and Iran as staging grounds for attacking Pakistan.

FILE PHOTO: EXPRESS The Foreign Office (FO) has reiterated that Prime Minister Imran Khan's comments on terrorism during his recent visit to Iran were presented out of context. At the weekly press briefing on Thursday, FO Spokesperson Dr Muhammad Faisal said PM Imran was referring to foreign-funded non-state actors when he spoke of Iran being affected by terrorists operating from Pakistani soil. "We must remember that even Kulbhushan Jadhav was arrested from the Pak-Iran border region." He announced that a meeting of the Pak-Iran border commission would be held in Islamabad next month. "Meetings of the Pak-Iran Joint Economic Commission and other bilateral groups will also be conducted over the course of this year," said Dr Faisal. "As stated by the premier during the press conference with President Rouhani, security issues of both sides need to be resolved completely through greater cooperation. We remain committed to comprehensive efforts to this end." Responding to a question, the FO spokesperson clarified that the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project was also discussed. "Both sides remain committed to the successful completion of the project." On PM Imran's visit to China starting today, the FO spokesperson said the four-day tour was of vital importance. "The prime minister will be holding meetings with the top Chinese leadership and other top leaders from around the world. This will be a very interesting and extremely important visit." Dr Faisal also condemned India's continuing atrocities in occupied Kashmir. "The occupying force has martyred two more innocent Kashmiris and has barred cellular services in the occupied valley. India continues to inflict misery on the people of Kashmir. We strongly condemn the treatment of Yasin Malik and other Kashmiri leaders and, once again, urge India to realise the need for dialogue," he said. He said Pakistan would continue to raise its voice against the anti-Muslim and anti-minorities policies of India's ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Responding to a question, the FO spokesperson said any future decision on Jaish-e-Muhammad leader Masood Azhar would be in line with Pakistan's national interest. On Sri Lanka, Dr Faisal said Pakistan had strongly condemned the Easter terrorist attacks and multiple offers of assistance and support were extended to the Sri Lankans. "We have not yet received any request for assistance in the investigation and forensics. Pakistan remains ready and willing to provide all possible support to Sri Lanka." On Afghanistan, he said Pakistan remains committed to an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led solution to the Afghanistan conflict. The weekly FO briefing concluded on a question regarding the status of the Pakistani community among rising violence in Libya. "Our high commission in Tripoli is in constant contact with the Pakistani community. We are monitoring the situation closely and are facilitating Pakistani nationals," said Dr Faisal.

News article:
Pakistan not to back any aggression against Iran: speakers IRNA – Senior political figures and leading Pakistani thinker said that Pakistan would not become part of any military misadventure against Iran. They emphasized on the government to strengthen relations with Iran by addressing issues of mutual concern and building trade ties. They said that Iran and Pakistan should cooperate for greater Asia region. They also stressed upon the need for the implementation of Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project for Pakistan’s national interest. They were speaking at a seminar on ‘Pakistan – Iran Relation: Challenges and Prospects’ organized by Islamabad Policy Institute (IPI). The discussion was held in the context of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s recent trip to Tehran. Ambassador of Iran to Pakistan Mehdi Honardoost was also present on the occasion. Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Ali Zaidi, in his key note speech, recalled how Prime Minister Khan and the Iranian leadership overcame their communication gap during the premier’s visit to Iran through some candid talk. “It was a very positive visit. Ice has been broken and foundation has been laid for better ties. We now have to build on it,” he said in his assessment of Mr Khan’s maiden trip to Iran. While pointing out that several countries have continued trading with Iran despite sanctions, the federal minister said, ‘We too need to keep our interest supreme and explore ways for completing gas pipeline.’ He noted that absence of banking channels had been a major hindrance in development of ties, therefore a barter mechanism was under discussion for promoting bilateral trade. Chairman of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Senator Mushahid Hussain, while presiding over the session, said the two neighboring countries enjoyed convergences in geography and culture with Allama Iqbal being the cementing factor; and compatibility of interest. ‘There is no incompatibility of interest on core issues,’ he underscored. However, he observed, there were concerns, mostly in security domain, which were being addressed through an ongoing and sustained security dialogue. Mushahid said Pakistan would never support a military adventure in the region and would not allow its territory to be used against Iran. He opined that scrapping of the Iran nuclear deal was detrimental for global and regional peace. He thanked Supreme Leader of Iran’s Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei for supporting the Kashmir cause. Pakistan Peoples Party leader Farhatullah Babar hailed PM Khan’s candid remarks on terrorism during Iran visit saying relations can be improved only by beginning with a clean slate. ‘There should be truth telling on both sides and the issue of ungoverned spaces on either sides of the border need to be tackled immediately,’ he said and regretted that in the past this important relationship was mishandled. Convener of Pak-Iran Friendship Group in Senate Lt Gen (R) Abdul Qayyum said there should be efforts for developing direct air link between Islamabad and Tehran and bilateral trade even if through barter to avoid sanctions. Gen Qayyum said Pakistan would never support aggression against Iran or its diplomatic isolation and economic strangulation. Director General Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI) Aizaz Chaudhry said that it was incomprehensible that Pakistan and Iran have not fully exploited the potential of their economic cooperation and trade. He believed that border security issues should have been resolved long ago. These issues, he suggested, can be effectively addressed through security and intelligence coordination. “There is no option for the two countries, but to improve their bilateral cooperation and coordination,” he emphasized. Former Foreign Minister and President Pakistan Council on China Inamul Haque called for exploring ways through which bilateral trade can be enhanced with Iran despite the US sanctions and regularizing illegal trade. He also asked for seeing why fencing was required on borders with Iran and Afghanistan. Executive Director Islamabad Policy Institute Professor Sajjad Bokhari said that Iran and Pakistan always enjoy strong brotherly ties. He added that border between Iran and Pakistan is the border of peace and both countries have always shown readiness to discuss border issues at the very highest level. He added that improved border security can help for better understanding on different issues.

News article:
Voicing serious concerns over the deepening crisis in the Persian Gulf, Pakistan on Thursday urged Iran and the United States to show restraint as any “miscalculated move can transmute into a large-scale conflict”.Speaking at a weekly news briefing in Islamabad, Foreign Office Spokesperson Dr Muhammad Faisal said recent developments in the Persian Gulf region were disturbing.He emphasised the need for resolving all issues through peaceful dialogue and engagement by all sides.“The US decision to deploy aircraft carrier and bombers has added to the tensions and the existing precarious security situation in Middle East,” Faisal said. “We expect all sides to show restraint as a miscalculated move can transmute into a large-scale conflict."His statement came against the backdrop of heightened fears of a clash between the US and Iran. The US has recently sent an aircraft carrier and a bomber taskforce to the Middle East in response to what officials called “a credible threat” by Iranian regime forces.Saudi Arabia said that several of its oil tankers had been damaged in mysterious “sabotage attacks” after US warnings that Iran could target shipping in the region.Observers believe that any serious conflict between Iran and the US would test the diplomatic skills of Pakistan, which has close ties with Iran’s arch rival Saudi Arabia but at the same time does not want to antagonise the neighbouring country.Sensing the gravity of the situation, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi recently admitted that Pakistan needed to evolve a clear strategy on the Iran-US tensions. He went on to say that Pakistan would not join any camp in case of a conflict broke out between the Tehran and Washington. Qureshi noted that Pakistan would evolve its strategy keeping in view its best national interests.Meanwhile, the spokesperson said the UAE government had decided to release 572 Pakistani prisoners languishing in their jails. “Our mission in the UAE is in touch with the UAE authorities in order to expedite their release and deportation,” Faisal said.He also said that soon a good news would be shared regarding the release of Pakistani prisoners from Saudi jails. Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman during his visit to Pakistan in February had agreed to release over 2,000 Pakistan prisoners, held over minor crimes, at the request of Prime Minister Imran Khan.The spokesperson also confirmed that 50 Pakistanis were deported from the United States on Wednesday through a chartered flight.On the current situation in Kashmir, Faisal strongly condemned the Indian atrocities, saying the valley had been turned into a military camp, “where people are under siege, facing injustice, harassment and barbarism”.The spokesperson asked India to stop “misleading international community on Kashmir dispute and accept the ground realities and aspirations of the people of Kashmir.”

News article:
Iran's foreign minister was in Pakistan on Friday, a critically timed visit amid a simmering crisis between Tehran and Washington and ahead of next week's emergency Arab League meeting called by Saudi Arabia over regional tensions. The purpose of the visit by Mohammad Javad Zarif, who held talks with his Pakistani counterpart, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, and also Prime Minister Imran Khan, was not made public. But there has been speculation that Iran is looking to Islamabad and its close relationship with Riyadh to help de-escalate the situation. Ahead of Zarif's arrival, Pakistan's foreign ministry called on "all sides to show restraint, as any miscalculated move, can transmute into a large-scale conflict." Zarif has been criticized by name this week by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who named him and President Hassan Rouhani as failing to implement the leader's orders over Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Khamenei had claimed the deal had "numerous ambiguities and structural weaknesses" that could damage Iran. The official Iranian news agency IRNA quoted Zarif in Islamabad as warning of anarchy if world powers did not unite to stop what he called U.S. aggression — Iran's official parlance for Washington's pressure on Tehran. Tensions have ratcheted up recently in the Mideast as the White House earlier this month sent an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the region over a still-unexplained threat it perceived from Iran. And on Thursday, the Pentagon outlined proposals to the White House to send military reinforcements to the Middle East to beef up defenses against Iran. The crisis takes root in the steady unraveling of the nuclear deal, intended to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The accord promised economic incentives in exchange for restrictions on Tehran's nuclear activities. The Trump administration pulled America out of the deal last year, and subsequently re-imposed and escalated U.S. sanctions on Tehran — sending Iran's economy into freefall. Khamenei's criticism of Zarif signaled a hard-line tilt in how the Islamic Republic will react going forward amid President Donald Trump's maximalist pressure campaign. Iran declared earlier this month that the remaining signatories to the deal — Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia — have two months to develop a plan to shield Iran from American sanctions. On Monday, Iran announced it had quadrupled its production capacity of low-enriched uranium, making it likely that Tehran will soon exceed the stockpile limitations set by the nuclear accord, which would escalate the situation further. Several incidents have added to the crisis. On Thursday, Saudi Arabia said Yemen's Iran-aligned rebels again targeted an airport near its southern border with a bomb-carrying drone. The Saudi military said it intercepted the drone, while the rebel Houthis said it struck a Patriot missile battery at the airport. The Houthis have claimed three times in recent days to have targeted the airport, which also hosts a military base. It comes after the Houthis last week targeted a Saudi oil pipeline in a coordinated drone attack. Pakistan was quick to condemn the attacks and promised Saudi Arabia, a staunch ally, its full support. The kingdom this week announced a $3.2 billion deferred oil and gas payment package for energy-strapped Islamabad. With neighboring Iran, Pakistan walks a fine line and their relationship is sometimes prickly. Islamabad has little leverage with Washington, although relations between the two have improved since Pakistan expressed readiness to help move talks between the Afghan Taliban and Washington forward. IRNA also reported that Zarif came to Pakistan with a proposal to link Iran's port of Chabahar on the Arabian Sea with Pakistan's Gwadar port, mostly being developed by China as part of the multi-billion-dollar One Road project that will connect the Arabian Sea with China. The proposal is unexpected because Pakistan's rival India has been Iran's partner in developing Chabahar while Iran's key regional rival, Saudi Arabia, has been in talks to develop an oil refinery facility at Pakistan's Gwadar, though no agreements have been signed. Meanwhile, Oman's Foreign Ministry said it was working to "ease the tensions" between Iran and the U.S. The ministry in a series of tweets on Friday morning attributed the comments to Yusuf bin Alawi, the sultanate's minister of state for foreign affairs, and cited an interview in Asharq Al-Wasat, the London-based newspaper owned by a Saudi media group long associated with the Al Saud royal family. In the interview, bin Alawi warns war "could harm the entire world if it breaks out." He doesn't confirm any current Omani mediation but says both the U.S. and Iran realize the gravity of the situation. Oman's Sultan Qaboos bin Said spoke last week by telephone with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Oman, a nation on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, has long been an interlocutor of the West with Iran. The U.S. held secret talks in Oman with the Iranians that gave birth to the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.

News article:
Amid rising tensions in the Persian Gulf region, Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Bajwa has urged all sides for efforts to keep conflict away from the region.“War is not in anyone’s interest,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) quoted the army chief as saying in his meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif at the General Headquarters, who arrived in Islamabad on Thursday.During the meeting, the military’s media wing said, matters of mutual interest and evolving situation in the region were discussed.The Iranian leader appreciated Pakistan’s positive role for regional peace and stability.Earlier in the day, Zarif held a meeting with Prime Minister Imran Khan and Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi.Delegation-level talks were also held between Iran and Pakistan at the Foreign Office.Zarif’s visit comes against the backdrop of heightened fears of a clash between the US and Iran. The US has recently sent an aircraft carrier and a bomber taskforce to the Middle East in response to what officials called “a credible threat” by Iranian regime forces.

News article:
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Iran on Friday agreed to work for bringing down the tension in the region. The visiting foreign minister of Iran had significant meetings with Prime Minster Imran Khan, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa and had extensive talks with Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi separately here Friday. It was agreed during the meetings that war is not in favour of any country, therefore, it should be avoided. Iran Foreign Minister Dr Javad Zarif dashed to Islamabad on Thursday evening amid the rising tension in the Arabian Gulf area as his interlocutors here reminded disastrous outcome of military clash while General Qamar Javed Bajwa urged all sides to make efforts to keep conflict away from the region. Dr Javad Zarif, who visited India last week, engaged in hectic diplomatic efforts to ward off threats of war with the United States. “War is not in anyone’s interest,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) quoted the army chief as saying in his meeting with Javad Zarif at the General Headquarters. Matters of mutual interest and evolving situation in the region were discussed during the meeting. The visiting dignitary appreciated Pakistan’s positive role for regional peace and stability. The visit has taken place in the aftermath of Pakistan’s offer to mediate between Iran and the US. The offer was formally extended a day before the arrival of the Iranian foreign minister to Islamabad. The Foreign Office Spokesperson, Dr Muhammad Faisal, said on Thursday that Pakistan always supported dialogue and desired that all issues should be settled peacefully and through engagement by all sides. “If required, Pakistan is ready to play constructive and positive role in this regard,” he added. It has been officially stated that Iran’s foreign minister discussed Pakistan-Iran bilateral relations during his meeting with Prime Minister Imran Khan. Imran Khan expressed concern over the rising tensions in the Gulf, emphasising that war was neither a solution to any problem nor in anyone’s interest. He said all sides needed to exercise maximum restraint in the current situation. The prime minister stressed that every effort should be made to resolve the issues within the framework of international law and through diplomatic engagement. He added that Pakistan was prepared to use its friendly relations in the region to help lower tensions among the brotherly countries and promote peace and stability in the region. Imran Khan expressed satisfaction over the excellent bilateral relations between Pakistan and Iran. He underscored that early implementation of various decisions reached during his visit to Iran would further enhance cooperation in all areas. Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi was also present on the occasion. Delegation-level talks were held between Iran and Pakistan at the Foreign Office. Javad Zarif said he has brought a message of connecting the Gwadar and Chahbahar ports. He said the world community must stop the US from aggression. Javad Zarif also called on National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser in the Parliament House. The speaker underlined the importance the people and Government of Pakistan attached to the longstanding brotherly relations between the two countries. The speaker expressed his deep concern over the recent tension in the Gulf region which posed a threat to the regional peace and stability. He said that all sides needed to exercise restraint and a solution may be found for amicable resolution within the framework of international law. He reiterated the support of Government of Pakistan for joint comprehensive plan, which represents an excellent example of negotiated settlement of complex issues through diplomacy and dialogue. Referring to his interaction with his counterpart Dr Ali Larajani, the speaker said that there was a broader consensus for strengthening the Pakistan-Iran relations through enhancing parliamentary interaction and cooperation. The Iranian foreign minister thanked the speaker for his sentiments and said Iran had special affection for their Pakistani brethren and strongly believes in the need for further strengthening of these relations. He said that continuous interaction between the political and parliamentary leadership from both countries would help further cement Pak-Iran relations. He said that Iran would exercise restraint, however, would not allow anyone to wage economic war on Iran. The US has recently sent an aircraft carrier and a bomber taskforce to the Middle East in response to what officials called “a credible threat” by the Iranian regime forces. Pakistan views the situation in the region as serious and it needs to be addressed through dialogue by all parties. Pakistan asked the parties to show restraint, as any miscalculated move can transmute into a large-scale conflict. Pakistan’s position is very clear in this regard. It supports dialogue in all situations. If there is any problem, it should be resolved through peaceful dialogue and negotiations. The sources reminded that the showdown between the US and Iran is obviously imminent but skilful diplomacy could push the clouds of war away from the region. Pakistan is watching the situation and making efforts to help avoid active clash, the sources added.

Zarif discusses Washington's anti-Iran measures in trip to Pakistan Iran Press TV Fri May 24, 2019 07:04PM Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said that talks during his ongoing trip to Pakistan have focused on countering Washington's anti-Iranian measures. "Discussions were held with Pakistan's leaders regarding how the two countries can counter the United State's ambitions and bullying," said Zarif on Friday, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). The Iranian foreign minister made the comments after meeting Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, Pakistani Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa and Pakistan's National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser. In a meeting with the Pakistani prime minister, the two officials discussed boosting mutual ties between the two countries, describing relations between Tehran and Islamabad as being in a good state and stressing the need to remove any obstacles impeding a further expansion of relations. Upon meeting with Zarif, Pakistan's foreign minister said that Islamabad seeks to facilitate the resolution of regional issues by diplomatic means, an issue that had been reportedly discussed between the two foreign ministers alongside expanding energy relations. Zarif also discussed expanding security cooperation with Pakistan's defense chief. Speaking after the Friday meetings, the Iranian foreign minister further pointed that Tehran and Islamabad had a common position regarding the negative role of "arrogant powers" on the world stage, adding that the two countries were specifically concerned about United States President Donald Trump's so-called "peace place" for Palestine. "We talked about the need for cooperation among all Islamic countries to counter American and Zionist schemes against the region, including in Palestine and "deal of the century", which is an attempt to quash the ideals of the Palestinian people," Zarif added. Upon arriving in Islamabad, Zarif had stressed the need for regional and international cooperation to safeguard international security and the respective interests of individual states, saying that the "American sanctions had targeted international order".

The meeting also saw Pakistan being elected vice chair of the bureau of OIC Summit from Asia.Earlier, in a separate meeting with OIC Secretary General Yousef al Othaimeen in Jeddah, Qureshi said the OIC Contact Group for Jammu and Kashmir must play its due role in highlighting Indian atrocities at the international level.According to Radio Pakistan , the minister said the solution to the challenges facing the Muslim community lies in unity and joint efforts. “Pakistan gives high value to the OIC and it intends to set up a permanent mission of OIC in Jeddah,” he said.The foreign minister expressed hope that the OIC secretary general would review the implementation of joint decisions regarding Islamophobia taken in the meeting of the OIC Executive Council in March this year.

News article:
Jeddah- Mohammed Al-Ayed Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has affirmed that the summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) hosted by Saudi Arabia in attendance of Arab, Gulf, and Islamic leaders is an opportunity to address the tensed conditions in the region and avoid the breaking out of the war. Amid the tension arising from the Iranian interventions in the region, Qureshi said that the war won’t be in the best interest of anyone, and won’t serve the region or the global economy. In fact, it would weaken the investment and increase the threat of terrorist activities, he added. Despite all, Iran remains part of the region and can’t be removed and that’s why there should be a way to deal with it, Qureshi asserted. As for the ballistic missiles launched by Houthis - Iran’s arm in Yemen – towards Makkah, Qureshi told Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that any attack against the kingdom and the Two Holy Mosques is equivalent to an attack targeting Pakistan. Qureshi stressed that his country will be ready in case any danger threatens the Saudi territories, lauding the continuous Saudi support to Pakistan. Commenting on the attacks against energy sources and passages in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, the Pakistani FM stated that these energy sources don’t only contribute to economy and trade development on the level of Saudi Arabia but the world overall. Further, he considered that the Iranian intention to close the Strait of Hormuz would escalate regional crises -- Qureshi urged Iran to desist from escalation and to open up to diplomacy because extremist means would not be constructive. Qureshi noted that the visit of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, to Pakistan brought several achievements to both countries, adding that Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have key roles in the Islamic world that could boost stability and security in the region.

News article:
JEDDAH: Pakistan’s Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs Shah Mehmood Qureshi said on Wednesday that his country is willing to play a role to help resolve some of the region’s “long-standing issues” between Muslim countries. Speaking exclusively to Arab News on the sidelines of the 14th Islamic Summit Conference in Makkah, Qureshi said: “Pakistan believes that this region is in flux. We have some very serious issues in the region. Our message is that we have to join hands; we have to understand each other’s concerns and have a collective objective of peace and stability so that our region can develop like other parts of the world. “The point is that it is a concerted effort,” he continued. “How are we going to achieve what we want to achieve if we do not sit and resolve our issues through diplomatic means? We should keep on joining hands, as that is the only way forward.” With around 5 million Pakistanis working in the Gulf, the region is of special interest to Islamabad, Qureshi pointed out. “We have excellent relations with all Gulf countries, historically and traditionally,” he said. “The Gulf is economically very important for Pakistan. The bulk of our energy requirements are being fulfilled from the Gulf. “So, for Pakistan, peace within the GCC states is always advocated. And the issues within the Gulf need to be resolved through dialogue. You can agree to disagree, but you can reconnect to resolve,” he added. Asked to comment on Iran’s role in the escalating tension in the Gulf, Qureshi said that any country isolating itself from the rest of the Muslim world “because of pursuing a particular policy” was going to suffer negative consequences. However, he added, “Iran is part of the region. It is a country that you have to live with. We share a border with them, so we recognize the challenges. But we have to see how those tensions can be defused and resolved.” Qureshi met with Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, in Islamabad last Friday to discuss rising tensions between Iran and the US. “My message to him was: Restraint, calm, and resolution of issues through diplomatic channels,” he said. “Conflict will not pay. It will only aggravate the situation. People want to see peace and stability in the entire region and we all have to play a responsible role.” It is important, he said, for the Muslim world to improve its international image. “We have to eliminate terrorist elements, and we have to reverse extremism,” he said. “Why is the world looking at us in a particular way? And how can we get rid of that image to make the world look at us positively?” Forums such as the Islamic Summit Conference and Arab League meetings provide vital opportunities to answer such questions, he suggested. “These meeting are very important,” he said. “And they will provide ample opportunity for all of us to achieve our goals.” One particular goal on which Pakistan is currently focused is a resolution to “the Kashmir issue.” “The situation (on the Indian side of Kashmir) has changed dramatically,” Qureshi said. “Today the world recognizes that Kashmiris — Kashmiris who were engaging with the union in India — are now distant from the center because the reality on the ground has changed.” A number of reports, from the UN, the UK and the EU, he said, “are all pointing in one direction.” “People are being alienated, excessive use of force has taken place, human rights are being violated and people are being killed and maimed,” he explained. “Pellet guns are being used and horrific stories of killings and gang rapes have surfaced. The situation is explosive, and unless it is addressed, it could lead to new tensions within South Asia between two neighbors, and no one wants that; particularly the Gulf countries because any deterioration will affect the Gulf as well. “We want to live in peace with India, but the issue of Kashmir has to be addressed,” he continued. “It cannot be ignored or overlooked.”

News article:
(MENAFN- Gulf Times) The Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs has called on the authorities in Saudi Arabia to remove obstacles facing citizens and residents of Qatar who wish to visit the holy sites to perform Umrah during the holy month of Ramadan or Haj as its season approaches. In a statement issued on Thursday, the ministry also demanded that the Saudi authorities provide all facilities similar to those extended to other citizens of the GCC states and Arab and Islamic countries. The ministry noted that direct flights from Doha to Jeddah are still not allowed, and that Saudi Arabia continues to close the only land border crossing which is used by people from Qatar who cannot travel by air and want to visit Al-Masjid Al-Haram (Grand Mosque) in Makkah Al-Mukarramah. The ministry pointed out that the Saudi authorities do not allow the Qatari Umrah and Haj campaigns to enter and obtain the necessary licences, which are available for Haj authorities of all other countries. This means that they cannot ensure the health and safety of pilgrims, which is a great challenge, especially in the case of women and the elderly persons and patients. The ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs pointed to systematic media incitement against Qataris and the dangers that may ensue. The continuation of inflammatory media discourse against Qatar and Qataris may pose a threat to their safety, it added. The ministry renewed its call on the Saudi authorities to review these discriminatory measures against Qatari citizens and residents, calling for a heightened sense of religious responsibility and non-politicisation of the religious rituals. The Haj is a religious pilgrimage for Muslims that must be carried out at least once in a lifetime by all who are physically and fi nancially capable of undertaking the journey. The event takes place once a year and culminates in the festival of Eid al-Adha, one of the two major Islamic holidays. Saudi Arabia, alongside the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt, severed relations with Qatar in June 2017, and has placed the Gulf state under a land, sea, and air blockade.

The ministry noted that direct flights from Doha to Jeddah are still not allowed, and that Saudi Arabia continues to close the only land border crossing which is used by people from Qatar who cannot travel by air and want to visit Al-Masjid Al-Haram (Grand Mosque) in Makkah Al-Mukarramah. The ministry pointed out that the Saudi authorities do not allow the Qatari Umrah and Haj campaigns to enter and obtain the necessary licences, which are available for Haj authorities of all other countries. This means that they cannot ensure the health and safety of pilgrims, which is a great challenge, especially in the case of women and the elderly persons and patients. The ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs pointed to systematic media incitement against Qataris and the dangers that may ensue. The continuation of inflammatory media discourse against Qatar and Qataris may pose a threat to their safety, it added. The ministry renewed its call on the Saudi authorities to review these discriminatory measures against Qatari citizens and residents, calling for a heightened sense of religious responsibility and non-politicisation of the religious rituals. The Haj is a religious pilgrimage for Muslims that must be carried out at least once in a lifetime by all who are physically and fi nancially capable of undertaking the journey. The event takes place once a year and culminates in the festival of Eid al-Adha, one of the two major Islamic holidays. Saudi Arabia, alongside the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt, severed relations with Qatar in June 2017, and has placed the Gulf state under a land, sea, and air blockade.

(MENAFN- Saudi Press Agency) Geneva, May 15, 2019, SPA -- The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; the Kingdom of Bahrain and the Arab Republic of Egypt called on the State of Qatar to stop funding terrorist groups and respect the rights of migrant workers. This came in the speeches delivered by the three countries before the UN Human Rights Council at its meeting today to review the human rights situation in Qatar. In its speech to the Council today, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia called upon the State of Qatar to take the necessary measures to stop its financing of the terrorist groups and to take the necessary measures not to give terrorist groups media platforms to spread fanatical ideas of terrorism. The Kingdom also called for the removal of obstacles that hinder Qatari citizens and expatriates working in Qatar from performing Hajj and Umrah. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expressed deep concern over the tragic humanitarian situation of hundreds of Qatari families of Al-Ghufran clan as the Qatari government withdrew citizenship from members of Al-Ghufran clan, confiscated their money and property and discriminated against them with forced displacement in addition to robbing them of their rights to return home. For its part, the Kingdom of Bahrain called upon the State of Qatar to take the necessary and immediate measures to remove barriers to access to justice for migrant workers, to apply the necessary standards to ensure their protection from abuse and exploitation, to punish offenders and to ensure that they receive their wages in a timely manner. At the UN Human Rights Council's Review on Qatar, the Kingdom of Bahrain also called on the Qatari government to implement reforms to develop the contractual system to improve labor recruitment procedures and to intensify efforts to prevent forced labor. It also called on the Qatari authorities to fully implement the National Plan of Action against Trafficking in Human Beings and to ensure that victims reach justice. Egypt, for its part, called on the State of Qatar to take steps and steps to sever all forms of communication with individuals, organizations and terrorist or extremist entities, and stop providing financial, financial or moral support to them. It also called on Qatar to stop providing various forms of support to media platforms that disseminate hate speech and justify violence or incitement to it, whether in Qatar or abroad. Egypt called upon the Qatari authorities to end all arbitrary detentions and enforced disappearances against a number of Qatari nationals, including members of the ruling family. The Republic of Egypt called upon Qatar to commit to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and to adopt legislation to combat violence against women, including protection of migrant women, and to take immediate measures to end the arbitrary deprivation of citizenship of some Qatari citizens and to restore nationality to those arbitrarily deprived. --SPA 17:34 LOCAL TIME 14:34 GMT 0016 MENAFN1505201900780000ID1098526310

News article:
Riyadh - Fatehelrahman Yousif President of Djibouti Ismail Omar Guelleh hailed Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the Gulf, Arab and Islamic summits, saying it stems from its sense of duty towards the region. He told Asharq Al-Awsat: “The summits will bolster security and stability given the critical situation in the region.” He hoped that the Islamic summit would yield decisions that would help resolve crises and maintain unity and solidarity between Islamic states. “Saudi Arabia is the leader of the Arab world and Muslims. Any assault against it targets the Arab and Muslim nations,” he declared. The summits, he continued, are being held at time of instability in Yemen, Syria, Libya, Iraq, Algeria, Sudan and Somalia. He also noted Israeli violations in the Palestinian territories and the growing extremist and terrorist threats in the world. These challenges demand massive efforts, especially in wake of last week’s sabotage operation off the coast of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates, Guelleh said. “We condemn in the strongest terms the sabotage operation off Fujairah,” he added. Commenting on the security threats in the Arabian Gulf, Red Sea and Ban al-Mandeb Strait, he strongly condemned any threat to international marine navigation and international peace and security. Asked about the Iranian threat in the region and the targeting of Saudi Arabia with drones, he replied: “Saudi Arabia is the leader of Arabs and Muslims… We reiterate our condemnation of the recent drone attack against oil pumping stations in the Kingdom, as well as the failed ballistic missile attack that targeted the holy city of Makkah.” These assaults are dangerous threats to the security of the region and energy supplies, he added. “We renew our absolute solidarity with Saudi Arabia’s government and people in confronting them.” Guelleh also urged international solidarity to confront these criminal acts. On ties between Saudi Arabia and Djibouti, he said that they date back to Djibouti’s independence in 1977. Riyadh played a major role in ensuring this independence. “The fraternal historic ties between us are based on trust, understanding and high coordination on all levels,” he noted. “This consequently lead to common ground on several regional and international issues.” Moreover, he said that ties between Saudi Arabia and Djibouti witnessed a “qualitative leap” in wake of his latest visit to the Kingdom. “Relations between us are growing stronger every day,” Guelleh remarked. “I am in constant contact with Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Deputy Prime Minister and Ministers of Defense.” On developments in Sudan, he stated: “Throughout history, we have expressed solidarity with Khartoum and continue to do so based on the strength of relations that bind us.” He highlighted that Djibouti has played an honorable role in sponsoring peace deals and reconciliations in the Horn of Africa. He cited its efforts in bringing together Sudanese rivals in 1999, which culminated in easing tensions that existed at the time. Guelleh said that Djibouti was closely following the ongoing developments in Sudan and is completely prepared to exert all possible efforts to ensure its stability and interests. On relations with Eritrea after the Saudi-led reconciliation, he remarked that the deal helped restore ties with its neighbor and rebuild trust between them. He hoped that the reconciliation would be crowned with the demarcation of the border between them.

News article:
DOHA: Qatar said on Sunday that it had received an invitation from Saudi Arabia to attend emergency regional talks to discuss mounting tensions between Iran and the United States. Riyadh had called two gatherings – one for Arab League members, the other for Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) regional bloc nations – after a spate of attacks. Several tankers in Gulf waters were targeted under mysterious circumstances and a Saudi crude pipeline was hit by drone strikes coordinated by Yemen rebels who Riyadh said were acting on Iranian orders. King Salman had invited Gulf leaders and Arab League members to summits in Makkah on May 30 but it was not stated if Qatar was also invited to the Arab bloc deliberations. It was unclear if Qatar – subject to a Saudi-led economic and diplomatic boycott over alleged support for Iran and religious fundamentalist movements – would be invited at all, with Doha initially reporting it had not received an invite. Qatar's emir "has received a written message" inviting the government to join the crisis talks, the government's information office said in a statement. The invitation was received by Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani during a meeting with the secretary general of the GCC, it added. Al-Thani has previously called for a "dialogue" between Iran and the United States to resolve the crisis between their countries.

Qatar’s prime minister will travel to Saudi Arabia for two summits in the kingdom, authorities announced Wednesday. This would mark the highest-level contact between the neighboring nations since a Saudi-led boycott of Doha began in 2017.

Qatari emir's plan lands in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Credit: Qatar Today/Twitter Also on Wednesday, Arab media reported that a Qatari royal flight landed at Jeddah airport in Saudi Arabia, for the first time since the Gulf crisis began two years ago.

It confirmed on Sunday it has been invited by Saudi Arabia to attend the emergency summits, after previously saying it had not been. The four nations say the Gulf Crisis stems from Qatar's support for extremist groups in the region, charges denied by Doha. They have also pointed to Qatar's close relationship with Iran, with which it shares a massive offshore gas field that provides the peninsular nation its wealth. Qatar restored full diplomatic ties to Iran amid the dispute. Last week Qatar said it had not been invited to the two summits Saudi Arabia is planning in Islam's holiest site to discuss the implications of drone strikes on oil installations in the kingdom and attacks on four vessels, including two Saudi oil tankers, off the United Arab Emirates coast earlier this month. The invitation and a letter was passed to Qatar by the head of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the statement said, without saying whether Qatar would accept it. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have imposed an economic and diplomatic boycott on Qatar since June 2017 over allegations that Doha supports terrorism and is cosying up to regional foe Iran. Qatar denies the charges. Saudi Arabia has accused Iran of ordering the drone strikes, for which Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis claimed responsibility. The kingdom said that while it did not want war in the region, it was ready to respond strongly. The UAE has not blamed anyone for the sabotage of the tankers pending an investigation, and said it was committed to de-escalation. Iran has denied it carried out either attack. The UAE has said that the current "critical circumstances" in the region required a "unified Arab and Gulf stance."

News article:
The World Trade Organisation on Wednesday announced that it would investigate the complaint filed by the UAE against a ban imposed by Qatar on Emirati products. The global body has created an arbitration committee to oversee and probe the UAE complaint. Doha's ban arose after the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and transport ties with the small Gulf state because of its support for extremist outfits. "The UAE believes that the Qatari measures violated the WTO’s basic principles of market access and its rules against discrimination. The Qatari measures aimed to target the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, which opposed Qatar’s patronage for terrorism and extremism, dissemination of hate speech, and interference in the internal affairs of other countries," Emirati news agency Wam reported. It continued to say that Qatar is "indulging in gross duplicity in its efforts to use international bodies for its own ulterior motives" and called on it to "desist from supporting and funding extremism and terrorism". Last month, Qatar partially withdrew measures imposed against the UAE and its products in an announcement at the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body. The Qatari climbdown recognises that Doha's policies violated its international obligations. Abdullah Hamdan Al Naqbi, director of the International Law Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation, said after Qatar's move that it was ''a clear concession" before the UAE request was heard. ''We continue to seek Qatar’s full withdrawal of these measures so as to ensure Doha's commitment to its WTO obligations and ensure our exports of goods has free access to Qatar markets,'' he said.

News article:
The World Trade Organisation on Wednesday announced that it would investigate the complaint filed by the UAE against a ban imposed by Qatar on Emirati products. The global body has created an arbitration committee to oversee and probe the UAE complaint. Doha's ban arose after the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and transport ties with the small Gulf state because of its support for extremist outfits. "The UAE believes that the Qatari measures violated the WTO’s basic principles of market access and its rules against discrimination. The Qatari measures aimed to target the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, which opposed Qatar’s patronage for terrorism and extremism, dissemination of hate speech, and interference in the internal affairs of other countries," Emirati news agency Wam reported. It continued to say that Qatar is "indulging in gross duplicity in its efforts to use international bodies for its own ulterior motives" and called on it to "desist from supporting and funding extremism and terrorism". Last month, Qatar partially withdrew measures imposed against the UAE and its products in an announcement at the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body. The Qatari climbdown recognises that Doha's policies violated its international obligations. Abdullah Hamdan Al Naqbi, director of the International Law Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation, said after Qatar's move that it was ''a clear concession" before the UAE request was heard. ''We continue to seek Qatar’s full withdrawal of these measures so as to ensure Doha's commitment to its WTO obligations and ensure our exports of goods has free access to Qatar markets,'' he said.

By JT - May 29,2019 - Last updated at May 29,2019 AMMAN — Jordan will be participating in the Arab and Islamic summits set to be held in Mecca on May 30, an official source told The Jordan Times on Tuesday. The emergency summits, called on by Saudi Arabia, are meant to address the “dangerous implications” of the sabotage attacks that targeted four commercial ships near the coast of the UAE and the attacks that targeted oil pumping stations in Saudi Arabia, the source said. The source highlighted that the Kingdom will take part in any efforts that guarantees the security of Arab countries, adding that “Jordan stands against any escalation in the region”. “Maintaining the peace and stability of Arab Gulf countries is a permanent Jordanian stance,” the source said, adding that “their security is Jordan’s security”. The official indicated that Jordan, like all Arab states, aims to protect the region from those who seek to tamper with it. The summits in Mecca reaffirm Arab solidarity and the strength of relations between Jordan and the Arab Gulf, the source underscored. “Jordan and GCC countries view each other as strategic partners,” according to the source. The source stated that the efforts of participating countries consolidate Arab solidarity and support the region’s causes. Meanwhile, Lower House Speaker and President of the Arab Inter-Parliamentary Union (APU) Atef Tarawneh on Tuesday welcomed the upcoming summits, calling on the leaders to seize the opportunity to demonstrate Arab solidarity and urging unity of efforts and putting aside differences to confront the challenges threatening the Muslim and Arab nations’ security and stability, the Jordan News Agency, Petra, reported. The timing of the summits aligns with the complicated regional political situation especially in the strategic Arab Gulf countries in light of the recent military escalation between Tehran and Washington, Tarawneh said. On behalf of the APU, Tarawneh called on Iran to cultivate better relations with Arab countries through translating its statements into practical steps on the ground that show its willingness to avoid violence, according to Petra. The APU president also called on Iran to resolve all international disputes peacefully on the basis of the UN Charter, urging Tehran to refrain from interfering in the region.

News article:
In the face of mounting tensions between the US and Iran, with repercussions across the region, Saudi Arabia is hosting two emergency summits in Makkah on Thursday, one with Arab League leaders and the other with members of the Gulf Co-operation Council. A third meeting with members of the Organisation for Islamic Co-operation will follow on Friday. Top of the agenda will be Iran's destabilising behaviour, which threatens the whole region, from its ties with Hezbollah in Lebanon to its support of Houthi rebels in Yemen. Leaders will be discussing Tehran's latest bout of aggression, launched under the weight of punitive US sanctions and in retaliation for the US pullout from the nuclear deal. Houthi rebels attacked a Saudi pipeline and Iran-backed militias launched a rocket at Baghdad's Green Zone earlier this month. The sabotage of four tankers off the coast of Fujairah in the UAE – which US national security adviser John Bolton today blamed on Iranian naval mines – will also be among the chief concerns of the summits. These meetings are an opportunity for the Arab world to stand united in the face of aggression. The nations convening in Makkah have strong historic and cultural bonds, even if they do not always concur on how to deal with threats. Iraq is expected to attend, despite its close ties with Iran. Qatar has been invited to the talks, even though the two-year boycott by the Arab quartet continues. Meanwhile, Hezbollah’s presence in the Lebanese government has prevented its leaders from taking a stand against Iran. The fragile stability of these two countries relies on maintaining good relations with both Washington and Tehran. But at a time when Iran is threatening to destabilise the whole region, a firm stance is needed to prevent further incursions. This is a time for Arab leaders to set aside their differences and express solidarity as those most affected by American-Iranian tensions. But Arab countries must also be able to count on their western allies to provide support. In this regard, Mr Bolton’s current visit to Abu Dhabi sends a strong message. He reaffirmed that the US, the UAE and Saudi Arabia were “on the same page” about the threat of Iranian weapons and made a point of visiting the UAE capital to discuss the next steps. Diplomatic talks are essential to de-escalate the situation and Mr Trump has repeatedly said he would be ready to sit down at the negotiating table with Tehran – an offer that Iran has shown no interest in reciprocating. The meetings in Makkah should not be treated as a mere photo opportunity. They can and should be used to reaffirm strong ties, decide a course of action and play a pivotal role in de-escalating a dangerous situation.

News article:
Qatar has been blockaded by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt since June 2017. The counties cut diplomatic and economic ties with Doha and accused it of supporting Iran and terrorism. Qatar denied these allegations, but is still isolated from its neighbours. Although this week, for the fist time since the blockade, Qatari diplomats travelled to Saudi Arabia to attend the summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council to discuss the situation around Iran. Meanwhile, Iran's deputy foreign minister has said that while the country is ready for war with the US, it still hopes to solve the crisis through dialogue. READ MORE: ‘Exclusive Intel' Claims Iran Cuts Funding to Allies Amid Economic War — Report The political analyst noted that Iran is the dominant force in the Persian Gulf in terms of its geographical and strategic position and the fact that it has advised all countries in the region to refuse to meet the demands of the United States only proves that it is seeking ways to diffuse tensions: "If so far no action has been taken by Iran, it only means that Iran does not want to exacerbate the situation. One should remember that countries in the region that would start a war would not be able to end it, because the scale of the war will increase as the number of its participants increases. Therefore, Qataris will never take such a risk and compromise the security of their country. Also, with the start of a war, the issue of oil transit through the Persian Gulf, which is of great importance for the West, will arise", Mosayeb Naimi concluded. The views expressed in this article are solely those of the speaker and do not necessarily reflect the official position of Sputnik.

News article:
Qatar has been blockaded by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt since June 2017. The counties cut diplomatic and economic ties with Doha and accused it of supporting Iran and terrorism. Qatar denied these allegations, but is still isolated from its neighbours. Although this week, for the fist time since the blockade, Qatari diplomats travelled to Saudi Arabia to attend the summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council to discuss the situation around Iran. Meanwhile, Iran's deputy foreign minister has said that while the country is ready for war with the US, it still hopes to solve the crisis through dialogue. READ MORE: ‘Exclusive Intel' Claims Iran Cuts Funding to Allies Amid Economic War — Report The political analyst noted that Iran is the dominant force in the Persian Gulf in terms of its geographical and strategic position and the fact that it has advised all countries in the region to refuse to meet the demands of the United States only proves that it is seeking ways to diffuse tensions: "If so far no action has been taken by Iran, it only means that Iran does not want to exacerbate the situation. One should remember that countries in the region that would start a war would not be able to end it, because the scale of the war will increase as the number of its participants increases. Therefore, Qataris will never take such a risk and compromise the security of their country. Also, with the start of a war, the issue of oil transit through the Persian Gulf, which is of great importance for the West, will arise", Mosayeb Naimi concluded. The views expressed in this article are solely those of the speaker and do not necessarily reflect the official position of Sputnik.

News article:
(MENAFN- Khaleej Times) Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Ibrahim bin Abdulaziz Al-Assaf has affirmed the success of Gulf and Arab summits in garnering support for Saudi and UAE position against the actions carried out by the Iranian-backed Houthi militia, the Saudi Press Agency, SPA, has reported. Speaking at a joint press conference along with Secretary-General of the Arab League Ahmed Aboul Gheit, and the Secretary-General of the GCC Abdullatif bin Rashid al-Zayani, following the conclusion of Gulf and Arab summits in Makkah, Dr. Al-Assaf said that the Iranian-backed Houthi militia were behind the attacks on two oil pumping stations in the Kingdom by using armed drones, and also sabotaged commercial vessels near the UAE's territorial waters. Saudi Foreign Minister said that the GCC countries have expressed their desire for peace and cooperation with Iran, but "Iran must stop supporting terrorist acts in our countries and be a cooperative neighbour". He added that the focus of these meetings was on the terrorist attacks on vessels near the UAE's territorial waters and the drone attacks on two pumping stations in Afif and Dawadmi governorates in Saudi Arabia, but "everyone knows that Iranian-backed terrorist Houthi militia has so far carried out 225 missiles and 155 drones attacks against the Kingdom". These attacks were carried out in the past, the Minister added, noting that this time they appear to be aiming at a huge escalation in light of the current situation in the Gulf region as well as relations between Iran and the United States. "In our view, these attacks have gone beyond the goals of the previous attacks," Dr. Al-Assaf stated. Answering a question about Qatar's participation in the two summits at the level of the prime minister, and if it is a beginning to solve the Gulf crisis, Dr. Al-Assaf explained that Qatar had participated in previous summits. He affirmed that Arab quartet's position is to find a solution to the causes of the crisis between these countries and Qatar, and there will be a solution "if Qatar returns to the right path". The Foreign Minister stressed that the concern from Iran is not only about its support for the Houthi militia and other terrorist groups, including the terrorist Hezbollah in Lebanon, but also their interference in the internal affairs of other countries such as Bahrain. The biggest concern, he added, is Iran's development of ballistic missiles and nuclear capabilities, pointing to the fact that this poses a direct threat to the Gulf states. He said that Iran's transgressions and support for the groups have exceeded Arab and neighbouring countries to Latin America and America "when they tried to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington". Minister Dr. Al-Assaf stressed that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's approach is clear, as it has repeatedly called for constructive and peaceful relations with Iran.

(MENAFN- Emirates News Agency (WAM)) MAKKAH, 31st May, 2019 (WAM) -- The 14th Summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) started in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, tonight under the chairmanship of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, and in the presence of the leaders of the OIC Member States. The UAE delegation to the Islamic Summit is led by H.H. Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, and include H.H. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation; Dr. Anwar bin Mohammed Gargash, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs; Reem bint Ibrahim Al Hashemy, Minister of State for International Cooperation; and UAE Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Sheikh Shakhbout bin Nahyan Al Nahyan. The 14th regular session of the "Hand in Hand toward the Future" Islamic Summit comes hot on the heels of two emergency Gulf and Arab summits which were held in Makkah Thursday to look into the mounting challenges besetting the region, primarily Iran's meddling into Arab affairs. The summit seeks to formulate a unified stance toward current issues of relevance to the Islamic world. It's focusing on the Palestinian cause and developments in the Arab, African and Asian regions. Cultural, economic, scientific, social and other matters of concern to the OIC Member States are equally being discussed. King Salman opened the summit by affirming that the Palestinian cause remains the top priority of the OIC's work. "The Palestinian causeis the utmost priority of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. It will continue to be the focus of our concern so that the brotherly Palestinian people will receive all their legitimate rights enshrined in relevant international resolutions and the Arab peace initiative," King Salman said. "We reaffirm our categorical rejection of any measures that would impinge on the historical and legal status of Jerusalem," the King added. King Salman condemned the recent sabotage attacks against commercial vessels in the UAE's regional waters and the bomb-laden drone strikes on Saudi pumping stations as grave menacing threats "not only targeting Saudi Arabia and the UAE, but the whole world." The OIC Secretary General Dr. Yousef bin Ahmad Al-Othaimeen spoke after King Salman and doubled on the central importance of the Palestinian cause. Al-Othaimeen also said that terrorism can never be associated with any religion, citing the recent Christchurch mosque mass shootings in New Zealand, which left around 50 people killed and dozens injured. 'Terrorism and extremism are some of the biggest challenges that we are facing, he said. WAM/Hatem Mohamed

Mecca – The 14th Islamic Summit hosted by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation has commenced in the al-Safa Palace in Mecca, with the attendance of Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz and several heads of state from the Arab and Islamic world. The summit this year is titled “Mecca Summit: Together for the Future,” and aims at developing a unified stance on events in the Islamic world. Advertisement The main topics of discussions for the summit will focus on the question of Palestine, Islamophobia, countering extremism and terrorism, and the situation of Muslims around the world. “The recent attacks do not only target the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, but also the maritime traffic, the maritime movement, and the oil supply globally,” Saudi King Salman said to the Islamic Summit in #Mecca.https://t.co/JTIjAZToCh pic.twitter.com/xksKaBSQDb — Al Arabiya English (@AlArabiya_Eng) May 31, 2019 Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz opened the session by saying that the Palestinian cause remains the top priority of the OIC’s work. “The Palestinian issue is the essential priority of the work of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which is the focus of our concern so that the brotherly Palestinian people will receive all their legitimate rights guaranteed by international resolutions and the Arab peace initiative,” King Salman said. “We reaffirm our unequivocal rejection of any measures that would affect the historical and legal status of Jerusalem,” he added. King Salman also spoke on the recent attacks on the Arabian Gulf, saying that the assaults were “not only target the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, but also the maritime traffic, the maritime movement, and the oil supply globally.” OIC Secretary-General Yousef Al-Othaimeen spoke next, reiterating Saudi King Salman’s statement regarding the Palestinian cause, adding that the Islamic organization “insists on the historic rights of Palestinians and on the two-state solution.” “We reject any action that infringes on the historical and legal status of East Jerusalem,” Al-Othaimeen told the summit. Al-Othaimeen also said that terrorism is not associated with any religion, citing the recent Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand. “Terrorism and extremism are some of the biggest challenges that we are facing,” he said. Speaking to Al Arabiya earlier in the day, Al-Othaimeen said that the Islamic Summit will complement the two previous Gulf and Arab summits held in Mecca on Thursday in its discussions regarding Iran’s disruptive activities both in the Arab and Islamic regions. “The stance of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation is clear and direct, that we are with the legitimate government of Yemen. We condemn all the actions perpetrated by the Houthis. We also condemn the countries which support the Houthis either financially, by supplying them with weapons, or those who provide them with a political cover. We support the stance taken by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Arab Coalition against the Houthis. At one point, even the Houthis attempted to launch a missile targeting Mecca,” OIC Secretary-General Yousef Al-Othaimeen told Al Arabiya. Analysts also weighed in during the day, saying they expect the Islamic summit to support the policies in place regarding Iran. “It was clear that both the Gulf and Arab emergency meetings were direct and unified in their stance regarding the Iranian file and we expect that the Islamic Summit’s agenda and final communique will not only complement the previous two summits but also take practical steps in how to implement future policies in order to tackle the issues at hand,” Hamoud Abutaleb, said a Saudi political writer. For his part, Radwan Buhaidel, an Algerian political researcher, told Al Arabiya that three summits come at a pivotal time in the region, especially after the exceptional circumstances in recent weeks. “These summits primarily address Iranian aggression, especially after the attacks on oil pipelines in Saudi Arabia and the maritime attack on the ships off the coast of the UAE. While the two Gulf and Arab summits were unified among Arab brethren regarding the issue, the Islamic Summit will focus on dealing with Iran on a wider scale as it affects other Islamic countries near the region,” Buhaidel said. “While Iran is still one of the main topics of discussions during the last day of the Mecca Summits, the Islamic Summit hosted by the OIC will probably give a priority to the Palestinian cause as well,” he added.

News article:
Qatar's foreign minister said on Sunday that Doha rejected the outcome of the recent Makkah talks on mounting regional tensions with Iran as it had not been properly consulted.Saudi Arabia hosted three summits in the holy city over the weekend critical of Iran after King Salman warned that 'terrorist' attacks in the Gulf region could imperil global energy supplies."The statements of the Gulf and Arab summits were ready in advance and we were not consulted on them," Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani told the Al-Araby broadcaster."Qatar has reservations on the Arab and Gulf summits because some of their terms are contrary to Doha's foreign policy."Tehran has strongly denied involvement in recent attacks on oil infrastructure and regional shipping -- incidents that prompted Riyadh to convene the three crisis summits.In a tweet just before the start of the summit, the king vowed to confront "aggressive threats and subversive activities".Qatar is the subject of a two-year Saudi-led economic embargo including bans on direct air, land and sea travel between the boycotting nations and Qatar, as well sanctions.The alliance, which also includes Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, accuses Qatar of supporting militant movements and Iran -- claims it denies."The Gulf summit statement talked about a unified Gulf, but where is it amid the continuation of Qatar's blockade?" added Abdulrahman in separate comments to state-funded Doha-based broadcaster Al-Jazeera.The summits "adopted Washington's policy towards Iran and not one that takes the neighbourhood into consideration", he added.Doha has looked to Tehran to ease its economic isolation, sourcing key imports from Iran and re-routing many flights by its flag carrier Qatar Airways over the Islamic republic."We hoped the Makkah summits would lay the groundwork for dialogue to reduce tensions with Iran," the foreign minister added in his comments to Al-Araby and reposted on Twitter by his ministry."The Makkah summit ignored the important issues in the region, such as the Palestine issue and the war in Libya and Yemen."

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump will host Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani at the White House next month, the White House said in a statement on Friday. The two leaders will discuss "economic and security ties" and counterterrorism issues during the July 9 visit, the White House said, amid a US effort to build pressure on the Iranian regime. Qatar has maintained cordial relations with Tehran even as other Arab states led by Saudi Arabia have cooperated with Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran. Saudi Arabia and its allies the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have boycotted Qatar for two years, unhappy about Doha's insistence on maintaining its own approach to regional relations and links with Iran and terrorist organizations. Doha denies any such links. Qatar is also slated to take part in the June 25-26 Bahrain conference on the Trump administration's Israeli-Palestinian peace initiative, where Washington hopes to raise financial pledges to support the Palestinian economy

News article:
The extraordinary series of summits called for by King Salman Bin Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia, which concluded in Makkah last Sunday, has highlighted a growing series of areas of concern that had to be addressed by all the participants. Iran’s aggressive policies in the region were at the fore of discussions among GCC ministers. Calls for Iran to abandon their subversive policies against Arab countries and give up their idea of dominating the region rang loud and clear. Diplomacy was stressed, but if Iran was to ignore peaceful overtures, then other means including armed conflict may result, something no one in particular in the region is looking forward to. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, or the OIC, was also present in full force at the Makkah summits. The 14th Summit of the OIC focused on the Palestinian cause and reiterated the Palestinians’ right to statehood. This was spelt out in the final communique released by the 14th regular session of the “Hand in Hand toward the Future” Summit. Their [Israeli] policies are eerily similar to those of the Nazi regime during Hitler’s reign in the last century, except more magnified as they are daily being exposed for their crimes... - Tariq A. Al Maeena The communique reaffirmed the centrality of the question of Palestine and the issue of occupied Jerusalem to the Islamic nation and reiterated the OIC’s “principled and continuous support at all levels for the Palestinian people to attain their inalienable national rights, including their right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian State on the 1967 borders with Jerusalem as its capital, and stressed the need to protect the right of return for refugees under resolution 194 and to face any denial of these rights with full force.” The document also condemned and rejected any positions issued by international bodies or countries, which support the “prolongation of the occupation and expansionist settlement project at the expense of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people, including the recognition by the US administration of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.” ‘An attack on the rights of Palestinians’ The statement also rejected and condemned in the “strongest terms of any illegal and irresponsible decision recognising Jerusalem as the alleged capital of Israel,” adding that any country’s decision to recognise occupied Jerusalem as the capital of Israel would be considered “null and void and constitutes an attack on the historical, legal and national rights of the Palestinian people and the Islamic world.” The Islamic Summit also called for the complete withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Syrian Golan Heights and return “to the borders of 4 June 1967, in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), the Land for Peace legislation, the Madrid Peace Conference and the Arab Peace Initiative adopted by the Arab Summit in Beirut in 2002.” The OIC communique was widely welcomed in the Arab world. The Israeli government must take note. This is the basis of all peace talks, and failure by Israel to recognise that the Arab and Muslim world would simply be ignored in their demands for a just peace where Palestinian rights are honoured would be an exercise doomed to failure. Israel’s apartheid policies It is obviously not something the Netanyahu government wanted to read in the OIC message for that would hinder their policy of ethnic cleansing and land robbing of Palestinian territory. Israel has adopted apartheid policies in recent years and has included the killing and maiming of innocent Palestinian women and children to its repertoire of terror against the legal owners of the land, specifically designed to drive them out. Their policies are eerily similar to those of the Nazi regime during Hitler’s reign in the last century, except more magnified as they are daily being exposed for their crimes and yet the world stands muted and silent in the face of the continuing onslaught. Perhaps Israel will begin to understand now that no peace is possible if those affected by their occupation are to remain subjugated as slaves in their own country, deprived of their basic rights and subject to daily assaults on their dignity. Contrary to a popular misconception, we do not want to drive the Israelis into the sea. And neither are we willing to watch the Palestinians being driven into oblivion.

News article:
The Hague (AFP) - The UN's top court on Friday rejected a request by the United Arab Emirates to take special measures against Qatar in a two-year crisis that has added to growing tensions in the Gulf. Oil and gas-rich Qatar has faced an economic and diplomatic boycott since June 2017 by Gulf rivals who accused Doha of backing terrorism and being too close to regional rival Iran. Abu Dhabi had asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to prevent Doha "aggravating" the dispute, after Qatar won a case last year over alleged discrimination against its citizens. ICJ Chief judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf said the court "rejects the request for provisional measures submitted by the United Arab Emirates" by a margin of 15 to one. The measures it asked for were temporary ones while the Hague-based court decides on a wider legal battle between the UAE and Qatar over the blockade. The legal blow for the UAE comes as tensions soar in the Gulf after two oil tankers were set ablaze in an attack that Washington has blamed on Tehran. - 'Groundless' request - Qatar's representative to the ICJ said it welcomed the rejection of the "groundless" UAE request. "Qatar brought this case to protect the Qatari people against the UAE’s policy and practice of racial discrimination. It is the Qatari people who are the victims here, and not the government of the UAE," said Mohammed Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi. For two years Saudi Arabia and its allies the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have barred Qatari flights from their airports and airspace, banned most Qatari visitors, cut trade and shipping links, and closed their borders, unhappy about Doha's insistence on maintaining its own approach to regional relations. Last June, in a case brought by Qatar, the ICJ ruled that the UAE must allow families which include Qatari members to be reunited, and that Qatari students must be given the chance to complete their education in the Emirates. Story continues But Abu Dhabi this year went back to court to seek the special measures, including to stop what it alleged was Doha blocking its own citizens from accessing Emirati websites to ease travel issues. It also asked the ICJ to order Doha to withdraw a separate discrimination case that it has lodged against the UAE with the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), a body which upholds a 1965 UN treaty on equality. - Regional tensions - The ICJ however ruled that the UAE's requests for special measures did not cover "plausible rights" that needed to be protected. "The conditions for the indication of provisional measures... are not met," the court said in its judgment. During a hearing earlier this year, the Emiratis meanwhile also accused Qatar of backing terrorist groups including the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda, echoing one of the original allegations by the Gulf allies against Doha. They also alleged that Qatar used its state-controlled news channels and fake documents to hamper Abu Dhabi's own efforts to damp down the row, and asked the court to tell Qatar to stop. Doha has repeatedly denied the claims of its rivals, accusing them of seeking regime change. Qatar has maintained cordial relations with Tehran even as other Gulf Arab states led by Saudi Arabia have cooperated with US pressure campaign against Iran, but Doha is also still close to Washington.

© Hatari / Instagram The Israeli broadcaster of the Eurovision said Iceland could be punished for holding up Palestinian flags during live coverage of the competition's voting results.Members of the Hatari group held up Palestinian flags with 'Palestine' written on them as the cameras were fixed on them during the announcement of their public votes at the final on Saturday night. The protest generated boos and cheers from the crowd at the Tel Aviv event, and support online."The Icelanders will apparently be punished by the European Broadcasting Union, which is really not tolerant of those who violate its rules," said Eldad Koblenz, CEO of Israel's public broadcaster Khan.Eurovision is meant to be non-political, so contestants could be disqualified or fined for breaking this rule. The EBU said that the move "directly contradicts the contest rules.""The banners were quickly removed and the consequences of this action will be discussed by the Reference Group [the event's executive board] after the contest," the EBU added.While the group received praise for its protest, the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) said that because Iceland had attended the contest instead of boycotting it, it was rejecting "this fig-leafing."Madonna also featured a Palestinian flag in her performance at the event. Two of her dancers wore a Palestinian and Israeli flag on their backs and held hands in a surprise addition to the routine that had not been cleared by the EBU or Kan.

Germany's decision to equate the boycott of Israel with anti-Semitism "violates international law", "international legitimacy" and is "immoral", the Boycott Campaign – Palestine said in a statement today. "This immoral decision violates as well human rights, freedom of expression and the right of people to support the oppressed around the world," the movement added. BCP warned that this decision "will give immunity and strengthen the occupation and encourage it to continue to commit further crimes and apartheid acts against the Palestinian people." Last week, German parliament – known as the Bundestag – voted to accept a motion defining BDS as anti-Semitic. The motion, "Resist the BDS Movement – Fighting Antisemitism," was sponsored by the Bundestag's two largest parties – Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian-Democratic Union and the Social Democrat party – as well as the Green Party and the Free Democratic Party. This decision, BCP said, comes at a time when Germany should be putting pressure on Israel "to comply with the resolutions of international legitimacy and end the occupation". "We call on the German parliament to immediately reverse the decision and support any popular action against any occupation around the world, especially the Israeli occupation, which continues to commit war crimes and genocide against the defenseless Palestinian people," the BCP concluded.

News article:
Advertisement Britain did even worse in the Eurovision Song Contest than viewers first thought as its disatrous bottom-placed entry was actually awarded five more points that it should have been on the night. Michael Rice’s song, Bigger Than Us, was originally thought to have picked up 16 points, putting Britain in last place. But it turns out he scored just 11 in the final on Saturday in Tel Aviv, as the Eurovision Broadcasting Union (EBU) reveal a mistake due to 'human error'. The blunder originated with the Belarussian jury's dismissal from the competition when its members broke the contest's rules by revealing who they'd voted for in the semi-final. Michael Rice (pictured, left) bagged a disastrous 16 - but it turns out he actually scored just 11. An error in counting resulted from a mistake in the allocation of points from Belarus (pictured, right, their entree, Zena) Duncan Laurence, 25, of the Netherlands reacts after winning the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Saturday, when Britain finished last For the final, competition bosses pooled previous Belarussian votes with those of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia and Georgia to give an aggregate score to award finalists. The scores were supposed to be spread among the countries that were running in the top 10, but the EBU mistakenly dished them out to the bottom 10, with Rice gaining five points belonging to Azerbaijan. What are the corrected Eurovision results? 1. Netherlands (498 points) 2. Italy (472 points) 3. Russia (370 points) 4. Switzerland (364 points) 5. Sweden (334 points) 6. Norway (331 points) 7. North Macedonia (305 points) 8. Azerbaijan (302 points) 9. Australia (284 points) 10. Iceland (232 points) 11. Czech Republic (157 points) 12. Denmark (120 points) 13. Cyprus (109 points) 14. Malta (107 points) 15. Slovenia (105 points) 16. France (105 points) 17. Albania (90 points) 18. Serbia (89 points) 19. San Marino (77 points) 20. Estonia (76 points) 21. Greece (74 points) 22. Spain (54 points) 23. Israel (35 points) 24. Belarus (31 points) 25. Germany (24 points) 26. United Kingdom (11 points) Advertisement Though the top four remain unchanged by the correction, winner Duncan Laurence’s song Arcade gained six points for the Netherlands after the error was rectified. Norway had points deducted and dropped to sixth from fifth. Yesterday's revelation came after fans claimed online that Hartlepool-born Rice should have received an even lower score. Wily Twitter users theorised that Belarus's points were incorrectly allocated to the bottom 10 songs rather than the top 10. Professor Adrian Kavanagh, of Maynooth University in Ireland, said: 'I think this is more a case of "you had just one job" rather than a scandal. Just an absolute mess up.' According to the Eurovision website semi-finalists get allocated into six pots, based on historical voting patterns as calculated by the contest's official televoting partner Digame. They say: 'Drawing from different pots helps to reduce the chance of so-called neighbourly voting and increases suspense in the semi-finals.' Belarus was in the same 'pot' as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Russia but the points Belarus gave were in the exact opposite order to the rest of the pot's rankings. The other four nations put Malta at the top, but Belarus gave it zero points. Belarus also gave Israel the maximum of 12 points, despite the other four placing it bottom. Dr Kavanagh believes the UK's low score was the result of a perceived lack of effort, rather than politics, after Rice suggested that he was being punished for Brexit. He said: 'I don’t think the poor UK jury results in past years are a reflection on Brexit, more a reflection that other countries don’t think that the UK cares or tries at Eurovision. 'When the UK has made a concerted effort at Eurovision, they’ve done OK with the juries, even in the Brexit era – Lucie Jones finished 10th in the Eurovision Final Jury Vote in 2017 (despite this being in the wake of the Brexit vote) on the basis that the UK had done a really great job that year in terms of the selection and staging of their entry.' On the topic of Ireland's jury giving the UK zero points Dr Kavanagh said: 'While Ireland's jury gave no points to the UK in the Final (the UK jury likewise gave no points to Ireland in the semi final), it was not unusual in doing so - only six juries awarded the UK points (and most of these only awarded 1 or 2 points).' Wily fans on Twitter first spotted the mistake, as social media user @euro_bruno drew up a table showing how the points should have been allocated (see top 10 in the table) and how they were in reality (see bottom 10) Criticism: Madonna left fans disappointed on Saturday night with her poor performance of 1989 hit Like a Prayer at the 64th Eurovision Song Contest, which saw Holland triumph at the competition, held at the Tel Aviv Fairgrounds in Israel All five members of the Belarus jury flagrantly disobeyed the competition's rules as they openly discussed who they had voted for in the semi-final on May 16, before the grand final had taken place. The members were Anastasiya Tikhanovich, Anzhela Mikulskaya, Artsem Mikhalenka, Olga Rizhikova and Valeriy Prigun. All of them openly discussed who their favourite entries were ahead of the final on Saturday - which is strictly against Eurovision Song Contest rules. Michael Rice (pictured on stage in Tel Aviv, Israel, last night) performed the song 'Bigger Than Us' as he represented Great Britain and finished in last place Duncan Laurence of the Netherlands performs the song 'Arcade' during the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest grand final in Tel Aviv A Eurovision Song Contest spokesman said: 'The Belarussian jury voting was revealed in an interview contravening Eurovision Song Contest rules. 'In order to be compliant with the voting regulations, the European Broadcasting Union took action and dismissed the Belarussian jury from the Grand Final on Saturday. 'An aggregated result approved by the auditors was used in order to determine to whom the Belarussian votes would be allocated.' The final had already been dogged with criticism as fans expressed disappointment over the highly anticipated performance from Madonna. During her appearance, two of the Queen of Pop's dancers embraced while displaying Israeli and Palestinian flags on their backs. Iceland's contestants, Hatari, also flew the Palestinian flag as they sat backstage awaiting to hear the results of the competition.

Just days after Germany’s anti-Semitism czar said that Jews would be ill-advised to wear kipot in public in some parts of the country, one of the nation’s leading dailies printed a “do-it-yourself kipah” cutout on its front page on Monday as an act of solidarity with the Jewish community. Ahead of the publication, which occupied about a quarter of the front page, Bild editor-in-chief Julian Reichelt wrote: “If only one person in our country cannot wear [a] kippah without endangering himself, the answer can only be that we all wear a kippah. The kippah belongs to Germany!” In an open letter printed next to the cutout, Reichelt called on Germans to embrace their Jewish compatriots. The paper’s online site also included a video of how to cut out the paper kipah. The gesture came in reaction to German anti-Semitism commissioner Felix Klein’s interview on Saturday, in which he warned that it was probably too risky to wear a kipah in public in the country. “My opinion has unfortunately changed compared with what it used to be on the matter,” said Klein. “I cannot recommend to Jews that they wear the skullcap at all times everywhere in Germany.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories He did not elaborate on when and where he thought doing so might be risky.

News article:
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has said German society must oppose anti-Semitism on a daily basis. His remarks came a day before a planned Quds Day march in Berlin protesting against Israel. Amid a public debate of Jews in Germany wearing yarmulkes in public, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on Friday that anti-Semitism in Germany "is an attack on all of us." "We cannot accept it if Jews don't dare to wear kippas in our streets," Steinmeier said. "It is our civic duty to fight anti-Semitism in all forms. And it is the exceptional duty of the state to protect our fellow Jewish citizens and to step in when necessary — also and even during demonstrations and public events. "Anti-Semitism is always an attack on all of us, on our democracy and our open society," he added "An active civil society must oppose this on a daily basis. Only when Jews are completely at home in Germany is this country completely at home." Read more: Jews in Europe alarmed by rising anti-Semitism Al Quds day protest The remarks were part of a conversation between the German president and Josef Schuster, the head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, according to a press release circulated by the president's office. Schuster has called on Germany to ban the Al-Quds march in Berlin, an anti-Israel demonstration on Saturday. According to police, about 2,000 people have registered to take part in the protest. Al-Quds is the Arabic name for Jerusalem and means "the holy." Al-Quds day was proclaimed in 1979 and marks the occupation of East Jerusalem by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967.

The comments drew criticism from the Jewish community, with some saying it was his job to make sure Jews could wear kippas everywhere in Germany. Ahead of Saturday's Al-Quds march, Klein said all Germans should wear kippahs as a sign of solidarity and a counter-protest to the Quds demonstration.

"Many people in Germany and in Europe think that the kippa comes from somewhere else — it's not adherent to our culture. That's not true. The kippa always belonged to Germany and to Europe. It is part of the Jewish culture and Jewish culture is part of German culture," Klein added. In regards to Saturday's Al-Quds march, Klein said: "It's absolutely unacceptable that, in 2019, we hear anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish slogans in Germany. I think we should all stand up against that.

News article:
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken out against anti-Semitism in Germany, and said that police have to guard every synagogue, Jewish school and daycare center in her country. “We have always had a certain number of anti-Semites among us,” Merkel told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in an interview aired on Tuesday. “Unfortunately, there is to this day not a single synagogue, not a single day care center for Jewish children, not a single school for Jewish children that does not need to be guarded by German policemen.” Merkel stressed a need to learn from her country’s troubled past. “We have to tell our young people what history has brought us and others and these horrors, why we are for democracy...why we stand up against intolerance.” Anti-Semitism is certainly on the rise in Germany. 2018 saw a near 20 percent rise in hate crimes against Jews and a near doubling of physical attacks compared to 2017, according to Interior Ministry figures. Meanwhile, the German government’s anti-Semitism commissioner Felix Klein told local media over the weekend that he “can’t recommend Jews to wear kippahs anywhere at any time in Germany,” earning him a rebuke from Israeli President Reuven Rivlin for “capitulation to anti-Semitism.” We acknowledge and appreciate moral position of the government of #Germany and its commitment to the #Jewish community that lives there, but fears about the security of German Jews are a capitulation to #AntiSemitism and an admittance that, again, Jews are not safe on German soil — Reuven Rivlin (@PresidentRuvi) May 26, 2019 Amanpour questioned Merkel on anti-Semitism in the context of the surge in popular support for nationalist parties like the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD). AfD finished in third place behind Merkel’s centrist coalition and the Green party in last weekend’s European Parliament elections. After several years of missing the threshold to enter Germany’s parliament, AfD finally won 94 seats in the Bundestag in 2017, riding a wave of popular anger at Merkel’s 2015 decision to let more than a million migrants enter Germany. The party has been accused of harboring racists and anti-Semites, but some accuse the new arrivals to Germany of bringing religious hatred of their own. From the Syrian migrant who beat a Jewish man with a belt in Berlin while shouting “Jew” in Arabic, to the group of suspected migrants who threw a firecracker at an Israeli journalist, to the mob who left a Syrian-Jewish boy with a head wound following a savage beating, a string of attacks began to build up a picture. Also on rt.com Beatings, harassment & bullying: Germany’s anti-Semitic hate crimes soar by 10% In a feature article titled ‘The New German Anti-Semitism’ last week, the New York Times describes a Germany in which Jewish parents encourage their children to keep their ethnicity to themselves at school, to avoid bullying from “Muslim students...who use the word ‘Jew’ as an insult.” In her CNN interview, Merkel suggested that anti-Semitism in Germany remains connected to the country’s Nazi past. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer also attributes the bulk of last year’s attacks to right-wing extremists. Anti-Semitism in Europe has traditionally been the preserve of the fringe right and fringe left. However, German Jewish community leaders have increasingly warned that Middle Eastern migrants are a new source of hatred. Last November, a group of these leaders requested that migrants be required to attend integration classes to combat the prevalence of anti-Semitic attitudes. With anti-Semitism coming from both new and traditional sources, Jews are increasingly feeling pressured to leave Germany. An EU-wide survey last year found that in 13 countries surveyed, Jews in Germany, France, and Belgium were most likely to consider emigrating to Israel. Think your friends would be interested?

News article:
The Israel lobby is already on it, the Strategic Affairs Ministry is preparing a brief, the embassy in Berlin is disseminating it – a new bill to be brought before the Bundestag, the law of kowtowing. According to the bill, anyone saying the name Israel will have to incline his head and bow while uttering the explicit name. No mention of Israel without bowing, that’s the lesson to be drawn from the Holocaust. Violating the law will be deemed an anti-Semitic act. Mentioning Israel without prostration will be a criminal offense. Politicians, broadcasters and run-of-the-mill citizens will practice making the gestures. Just like in Thailand, where anytime the king enters everyone genuflects, so will it be when Israel is mentioned. Isn’t the country deserving of this gesture? Is there a more just response to anti-Semitism? Following Germany will be other countries, including many states in the U.S. Just imagine what a huge success for Israeli diplomacy. >> Mossad involved in anti-boycott activity, Israeli minister's datebooks reveal We’re not that far from this scenario. If the German government adopts the Bundestag resolution, which determined that the boycott movement against Israel is anti-Semitic, we’re there. The boycott, divestment and sanction movement will be outlawed, or at least prohibited from operating in public. On Tuesday, Noa Landau reported in Haaretz that Israel is employing its propaganda machinery to exert pressure on the German government to adopt this decision. It’s bound to yield, just like Germany’s parliament did when it adopted this delusional resolution. A non-violent struggle against war crimes will be declared illegal. The oppressor will be declared a victim. Freedom of expression will become a joke. There is nothing to equal this in any democracy. Just before Israel’s ambassador to Berlin, Jeremy Issacharoff – who called it “shameful” when Jewish intellectuals signed a petition against the bill – pops the cork and reports another of his achievements to Jerusalem, we must ask: Is this really a successful move? For Israel? For Jews? Will such aggressive and rapacious conduct not blow up in Israel’s face? Will these imaginary achievements, attained by not-quite legitimate means, based mainly on the emotional blackmailing of Germany and the rest of the world, using various organizations, some covertly, exerting various forms of pressure, not exact a price from Israel, which has been standing behind this indecent campaign? Israel has invented a scarecrow enemy for itself, one called Adolf BDS, and decided to wage war on it. The Palestinians have been beaten, the Arab states are busy with their own affairs, Iran is no longer enough of an existential threat, so Israel urgently needed another one. The boycott movement formed by Omar Barghouti fell like a ripe fruit into the lap of a few Israeli politicians and diplomats. Suddenly, Gilad Erdan is not just a public security minister dealing with demolishing the Bedouin village of Umm al-Hiran and with traffic violations; now he’s a strategic minister, with a hush-hush organization that’s inflated with self-importance, with huge budgets, a military style director-general and meetings with the Mossad chief. He couldn’t have wanted any more than this. Branding BDS as anti-Semitic, like any criticism of Israel, has turned out to be the most effective strategy of all. Fighting anti-Semitism solves any problems associated with explaining Israel’s actions. Just say “anti-Semitism” and the world is paralyzed. One can kill children in Gaza, then say “anti-Semitism!” and squelch any criticism. Europe is still vulnerable on this. Exploit it to the hilt. It’s hard to believe that the hundreds of Bundestag members who voted for this resolution, which defines a completely legitimate struggle as anti-Semitic, actually agreed with it. One may assume that deep inside, many harbor doubts if not opposition to a move that was imposed on them. It’s not only in Germany. In most European countries it’s difficult to criticize Israel without being accused of anti-Semitism. This is the biggest victory achieved by Israel’s propaganda machine. It could lead to its defeat one day. When it becomes too much to swallow, there will be courage to oppose it and not accept this fallacious equation. When the kowtowing law is passed and Germans have to genuflect in front of Israel and not just dance to its tune, perhaps some people will be there to stop this march of folly.

News article:
This week’s meeting in Cairo between President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi and the chief of Sudan’s military council Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan could mark the beginning of wide-ranging cooperation between Cairo and Khartoum, says a senior Egyptian official. Saturday’s meeting is Al-Burhan’s first overseas trip. “Egypt’s relations with Sudan have gone through many ups and downs in the last 30 years. Now there is a feeling we might be seeing the beginning of solid relations on all fronts,” says the official. Government sources say this is not about the ascent of the military to power in Sudan — Omar Al-Bashir, they point out, was also a soldier — but about the determination to avoid a political vacuum in a country of direct national security interest to Egypt. An Egyptian source told Al-Ahram Weekly that “Cairo fears that political chaos would lead to a security chaos in Sudan.” The fact that the ruling military council is nearly in full control of Khartoum and Om Durman and its suburbs and not the rest of the country is pushing the major Arab governments for more support of the transitional ruling council. Following Al-Bashir’s assumption of power in the late 1980s relations between Egypt and Sudan were characterised more by squabbles than cooperation. In 1995 Cairo openly accused Khartoum of involvement in an attempt on the life of then president Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa after he arrived to take part in a summit of African leaders. The tensions never really cleared, even when Cairo showed solidarity with Al-Bashir during the last months of his rule. “Al-Bashir was always playing games, trying to ply one side against the other. Everybody knew this,” says Haitham Mekkawi, a member of Sudan’s Alliance of Freedom and Change. Speaking from Khartoum, Mekkawi argued undoing the damage Al-Bashir inflicted on the country’s foreign policy is an urgent issue for post-Bashir Sudan. “This is something that has to be done by the military and civilian political leaders and Egypt is clearly a priority given our historic ties and proximity.” According to the Cairo official, it is too early to predict the path of future relations but the overall picture seems promising. “The focus [of talks between Al-Sisi and Al-Burhan] was obviously on developments in Sudan but bilateral relations were also discussed,” the official added, and “joint security interests” would have topped the bilateral agenda. Since the days of Mubarak Cairo has been demanding Sudan stop offering refuge to militant Islamists, calls that expanded under Al-Sisi to include leading figures from the Muslim Brotherhood.Al-Burhan made no final promises, says the official, but was clearly committed to working with Egypt on security matters. Egypt and Sudan have a number of longstanding disagreements beyond security. There is Khartoum’s support for Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam, though in the last months of his rule Al-Bashir seemed to be readying for a U-turn on the issue. According to Cairo-based Western diplomats, during top level meetings between Egyptian officials and representatives from influential Western capitals Cairo continues to solicit support for its position on the dam. An official Sudanese source with knowledge of the decision-making process in Khartoum said this week that the initial willingness of Al-Burhan and his second in command, Hamdan Daglo, to pursue an alliance with the Cairo-Abu Dhabi-Riyadh axis suggests the future trajectory of Khartoum’s relations. Following his one-day visit to Cairo, Al-Burhan headed straight to meet Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed in Abu Dhabi. Meanwhile, Daglo had already been to Riyadh to meet with Mohamed bin Salman. A Cairo-based European diplomat who follows Sudan closely says the overall message Khartoum is conveying is a willingness on the part of the “new military leaders of Sudan to pursue an alliance with Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over Turkey and Qatar, Al-Bashir’s traditional allies during the last decade”. It is noteworthy, says the diplomat, “that both Al-Burhan and Daglo already have established contacts with leaders in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE where they have a history of serving or else overseeing joint military cooperation.” Mekkawi argues “relations with Egypt inevitably constitute a different story to those with other Arab countries, even with Saudi Arabia and the UAE whose aim is to win Sudan to their side and undercut the heritage of Al-Bashir’s ties not just with Qatar and Turkey but also with Iran.” Like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Egypt is also keen to ensure the cooperation of Sudan over Red Sea security. During the last few years of Al-Bashir, Cairo had grown increasingly concerned about Khartoum’s willingness to allow Ankara and Doha access to the Red Sea. According to the Cairo official, furthering cooperation over Red Sea security was raised during Al-Burhan’s visit to Cairo. Then there is the longstanding dispute over Halayeb and Shalatin, the triangle of land on the Egyptian and Sudanese border that both countries claim. It was not, says the official, on the agenda of the Cairo talks between Al-Sisi and Al-Burhan. “We are working on consolidating relations not on disagreeing,” he said. “Sudan is going through a hard time and we want to make sure it regains stability.” To secure truly positive prospects for Egypt-Sudan relations, argues Mekkawi, it is important that Cairo takes into account the views of Sudan’s revolutionary leaders as well as its military council. “We understand that Egypt has followed its own path since the January Revolution and made its own choices. We hope it acknowledges the right of the Sudanese people to do the same.” Mekkawi was speaking on the eve of a general strike that revolutionary leaders had called to force the military council into agreeing to wider participation in managing the transitional phase. The general strike was not backed by some political opposition figures, including former premier Sadek Al-Mahdi who has close ties with Cairo. Speaking on Monday Al-Mahdi said that a general strike “is a weapon that should only be used after it has been agreed on by everybody”. Al-Mahdi returned from Egypt to Sudan days before the beginning of the demonstrations that eventually led to Al-Bashir’s fall and did not immediately join the calls for change. According to the European diplomat who spoke in Cairo, “it is very clear that Egypt’s priority on Sudan is to support the military council and the traditional opposition. But Cairo is also aware that it should not antagonise public opinion in Sudan which is why it is playing its cards very carefully.” Eddie Thomas, an expert on Sudan who has authored several volumes on the country, believes it is too early to make any final judgements on the path Sudan’s foreign policy — be it towards Egypt or any other country — is likely to take. The ouster of Al-Bashir, he says, stripped Sudan of its sole foreign policy-maker. Today leading members of the military council are on the side of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates but there are others on the council who might solicit alternative alliances. It is also significant, Thomas adds, that Sudan’s revolutionary leaders are seeking a different political path to the one that emerged in Egypt following the ouster of Mubarak. The situation is complicated, Thomas argues, by the fact that “the Islamists of Sudan” constitute the ruling class, created under Al-Bashir during the last 30 years. And at the end of the day, says Thomas, the military council is not yet in full control because the people are still on the streets. *A version of this article appears in print in the 30 May, 2019 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly under the headline: Seeking southern partners Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki has said he appreciated Egypt’s support in helping lift UN sanctions on his country, following a recent thaw in tensions between Asmara and its neighbours. Afwerki said he valued Egypt’s stances on stability in the Horn of Africa, reflected in the lifting of sanctions from Eritrea in 2018, according to an Egyptian presidential statement. Afwerki arrived in Cairo on Saturday for a visit, meeting with President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi. In 2018, the UN lifted a nearly decade-old arms embargo and targeted sanctions on Eritrea after a rapprochement with Ethiopia and a thawing of relations with Djibouti, years after they were imposed following accusations that Asmara was supporting armed groups in Somalia. Afwerki hailed Egypt’s pivotal role in pushing development and preserving peace and security in the continent, stressing the ties between the two countries. El-Sisi also hailed relations between the two countries, according to the statement, stressing the strategic cooperation with Eritrea in various fields as well as the sustainable partnership at a bilateral level. He also stressed the two countries’ close coordination on issues related to the region and the continent, in light of Egypt’s chairing of the African Union this year. Search Keywords: Short link:

Afwerki said he valued Egypt’s stances on stability in the Horn of Africa, reflected in the lifting of sanctions from Eritrea in 2018, according to an Egyptian presidential statement. Afwerki arrived in Cairo on Saturday for a visit, meeting with President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi. In 2018, the UN lifted a nearly decade-old arms embargo and targeted sanctions on Eritrea after a rapprochement with Ethiopia and a thawing of relations with Djibouti, years after they were imposed following accusations that Asmara was supporting armed groups in Somalia. Afwerki hailed Egypt’s pivotal role in pushing development and preserving peace and security in the continent, stressing the ties between the two countries. El-Sisi also hailed relations between the two countries, according to the statement, stressing the strategic cooperation with Eritrea in various fields as well as the sustainable partnership at a bilateral level. He also stressed the two countries’ close coordination on issues related to the region and the continent, in light of Egypt’s chairing of the African Union this year. Search Keywords: Short link:

Sherif Seif al-Deen Hussein Khalil (L) and President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi (R) - Press Photo SHARM EL SHEIKH, June 12 (MENA) - The first African Anti-Corruption Forum reflects Egypt's deep desire to join hands with African states to face challenges posed by development and stability in the continent, head of the Administrative Control Authority Sherif Sief el Din said on Wednesday. Addressing the opening session of the forum, he said the convocation of the forum in Egypt comes as part of the country's constant efforts to back the African continent, citing its role in boosting African countries' struggle for independence; the foundation of the Organization of African Unity which is now known by the name of the African Union; and reforming the African Union. Corruption is now countries' biggest enemy as it causes losses amounting to billions of dollars and poses threats to development and stability, he said. He also said that fighting corruption is among the priorities of the African Union's 2063 agenda.

(MENAFN- Kuwait News Agency (KUNA)) CAIRO, June 16 (KUNA) -- During its first open-ended meeting on Sunday, a working group of the Secretariat of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) deliberated draft statutes of OIC's Organization for the Development of Women. The meeting, chaired by Helene Marie Laurence Ilboudo, the minister of women, national solidarity and humanitarian action of Burkina Faso, the current presidency of the OIC ministerial conference on women, gathered representatives of 33 of the 57 member states of the Jeddah-based organization. The meeting, held in collaboration with the Egyptian Foreign Ministry and the National Council for Women (NCW), comes pursuant to an OIC ministerial resolution to establish a Working Group to Prepare the Draft Internal Regulations of the Organization for the Development of Women. The resolution No. 17/7-W was adopted by the seventh session of the Ministerial Conference on the Role of Women in Development in OIC Member States held from November 30 to December 1, 2018, in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. In her inaugural speech to the meeting, NCW Chairperson Dr. Maya Morsy highlighted the need of empowering women economically, politically and socially, and protecting women against all forms of discrimination and violence. She applauded the OIC role in protecting the rights of women at a time when Muslims face hostile media campaigns and groundless claims of disrespect for women rights. "The OIC Organization for the Development of Women will open new horizons for cooperation and experience sharing in issues relating to women among the OIC member states and between the OIC, in one hand, and the relevant organizations worldwide, on the other," Dr. Morsy pointed out. "The planned organization will speak for women in the Islamic countries and highlight their status and achievements in the Muslim communities," she added. On the current meeting, she said it provided a chance for exchanging views on the efforts to assert the women's rights and the latest national reports of the OIC member states. For his part, Egypt's Assistant Foreign Minister for Human Rights and Humanitarian and Social Affairs Ahmad Jamal said the current meeting would signal the activation of the Organization for the Development of Women through the adoption of its draft internal regulations. He voiced hope that the gathering will reach consensus of these regulations as a prelude to presenting them to the coming OIC ministerial meeting on women, due in Cairo, next year. Ambassador Jamal affirmed that many OIC members, represented at the gathering, have endorsed the regulations, noting that Egypt was working for hosting the headquarters of the new organization. With a total population of nearly 1.6 billion Muslims, more than a half of them are females, the OIC member countries are looking forward to the new organization to reflect the rising presence of women in Islamic countries and their efforts to assert women's rights. Egypt will host tomorrow, Monday, a ministerial-level roundtable on "Empowering Women in the OIC Member States." (end) msh.rg.gb MENAFN1606201900710000ID1098645182

FILE- Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry CAIRO – 19 June 2019: In light of its continued efforts to encourage all Sudanese parties to resume dialogue, Egypt will chair a meeting for the foreign ministers of the regional partners of Sudan on June 20 in Addis Ababa. According to a Wednesday statement issued by Egypt’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ahmed Hafez, The meeting will be held in the African Union (AU) headquarters. Ethiopia, Chad, Congo, Central African Republic, Djibouti, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Uganda, Nigeria, Eritrea, and Egypt are all participating in the meeting. The meeting is held according to recommendations of the consultative summit of Sudan regional partners that was called for by President Abdel Fatah El Sisi on April 23 in Cairo. The meeting is part of regional efforts to reach an agreement on the current transitional period in Sudan after the ouster of President Omar Bashir. According to the state information service's (SIS) statement on the consultative summit, President Sisi asserted the consensus of the parties participating in the summit on the determination and courage shown by the Sudanese people in their peaceful efforts to reach their legitimate aspirations and the launching of a comprehensive process of peaceful democratic transition which establishes development and prosperity in the country. In his closing address before the consultative summit, held at Ittihadiya Palace, Sisi said the discussions reflected a common will to exert collective efforts to help the brotherly Sudanese people based on the relevant principles and aims of the African Union to establish security and stability in Africa. The meeting, scheduled for Tuesday in Ethiopia, aims at continuing efforts and affirming a collective African will to maintain and preserve Sudan’s stability and unity. On June 14, President Sisi received a phone call from his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron, as they discussed the latest developments in the region, including Sudan. During their call, Sisi asserted Egypt's support to the choices and will of the Sudanese people, reiterating Egypt's full respect to Sudan's sovereignty and rejecting any interference in its internal affairs. Sisi also stressed the need for intensifying international efforts to help Sudan end its current crisis and maintain its stability and security to achieve the best interests of the Sudanese people. Last February, Sisi headed to Addis Ababa where he formally received the presidency of the African Union from his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame at the inauguration of the 32nd summit of the AU. The summit which was inaugurated under the theme “The year of refugees, returnees, and international displaced persons - towards durable solutions to forced displacement in Africa” witnessed discussions on the African Peace and Security Council and the implementation of the AU road map and its capability to end civil armed conflicts on the continent by the end of 2020. On June 12, Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry hailed Egypt's deeply-rooted ties with African countries during a ceremony held in commemoration of Africa Day, which marks the anniversary of the founding of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on May 25, 1963. In a statement for spokesperson Ahmed Hafez, he said that the minister explained that this year's ceremony is of special importance due to Egypt's 2019 chairmanship of the African Union, noting that Egypt focuses on achieving sustainable development and establishing peace and stability throughout the continent. Hafez's statement reported that Shoukry highlighted the need to promote inter-African cooperation to attain the aspirations of African peoples.

(MENAFN- Daily News Egypt) United Nations Assistant Secretary-General for Rule of Law and Security Institutions, Alexandre Zouev, visited Egypt from 18 to 20 June to further strengthen the solid partnership established between the United Nations Office for Rule of Law and Security Institutions (OROLSI) with the Egyptian government over the years. The visit focused on the areas of police, justice, corrections, disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration, and mine action. In Egypt, Zouev met high-level government officials from the ministries of foreign affairs, defence, interior and its Police Academy, justice and the Prosecutor General's office as well as with the Cairo International Centre for Conflict Resolution, Peacekeeping, and Peacebuilding. Assistant Secretary-General Zouev's visit came in the context of a regular high-level visit undertaken by OROLSI senior officials to forge stronger relations with Egypt, a key partner in multilateral diplomacy and security, particularly in the Africa and MENA regions. During Zouev's visit, Cairo International Center for Conflict Resolution, Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding (CCCPA) hosted the signing ceremony of a cooperation framework with the UN OROLSI to enhance their cooperation in the areas of preventing radicalisation and extremism leading to terrorism, disarmament, demobilisation, and reintegration. OROLSI includes five components: Police Division; Justice and Corrections Service; Disarmament, Demobilisation, and Reintegration Section; Security Sector Reform Unit, and UN Mine Action Service. On the ground, more than 15,000 security professionals are fulfilling a wide range of essential tasks, including national capacity and institution building. Police peacekeepers patrol crime hotspots alongside officers from national law enforcement agencies. Weapons experts educate civilians on the risks of explosive hazards. Judicial and corrections officers help ensure that all citizens be treated equally under the law. DDR specialists help former fighters reintegrate into society. Security sector reform advisers ensure that oversight and accountability are built into police, defence, and intelligence services. As a UN specialised capacity, OROLSI deploys high quality technical expertise and advisory support at the request of host-governments to assist conflict-affected countries to re-establish the rule of law and security institutions necessary to build and sustain peace, according to OROLSI's website. Beginning in January 2019, OROLSI began its function as the UN system-wide service provider for technical support in the areas of rule of law and security institutions to UN peace operations and to member states and UN system entities in non-UN mission settings.

He also referred to Japan's contribution in the Grand Egyptian Museum, which is considered a symbol for cultural cooperation between the two countries aiming to support the tourism sector in Egypt, Radi said. President Sisi affirmed his appreciation of the strong and fruitful relations with Japan, congratulating the Japanese government and people as new Emperor Naruhito officially assumed the Japanese throne in May. The discussions between Sisi and Abe also addressed preparations for the seventh Tokyo International Conference for African Development (TICAD) set to be held in August, Radi said.

The World Bank currently has 16 projects in Egypt, worth a total of $7.5 billion The World Bank approved new funding of $500 million for three years to help Egypt strengthen the country's social safety nets, the Ministry of Investment and International Cooperation said Wednesday. The new financing is aimed to support the expansion of the “Takaful and Karama” cash transfer programme, which was launched in 2015, for an additional three years, the ministry said in a statement on its official website. "As Egypt implements the second phase of the economic reformme programme, we remain committed to providing sustainable income-generating opportunities," Minister of Investment and International Cooperation Sahar Nasr said, according to the statement.

(MENAFN- Brazil-Arab News Agency (ANBA)) Isaura Daniel São Paulo – A Brazilian pastry chef is helping North Africa entrepreneurs start ice-cream and popsicle businesses in their countries. Francisco Santana has assisted up-and-coming businesspeople in several countries, including Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. He is currently working with a startup in Egypt. In São Paulo, Santana ownsEscola Sorvete(the Ice Cream School), which offers one-on-one and online courses. He gives guidance to the soon-to-be entrepreneurs on all aspects of starting a business, from product manufacturing – including choice of flavors and machinery – to point of sales. He also teaches one-on-one in other countries, but the bulk of non-Brazilian students get lessons and consulting online. Santana's a master ice cream maker The chef explains that he taught students in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia a few years ago, and is currently teaching online classes to an Egyptian who's about to open a popsicle factory and store under the Top Pop brand. He expects to travel to Cairo later this year to help set up the production line. He was referred for this job by a person in Portugal, and the business is at its early development stages. The classes began about 40 days ago, and Santana believes operation will begin this year. The chef intends to stop by Egypt on his way to Dagestan, Russia, where he's working with a Muslim entrepreneur in another popsicle business. Dagestan is home to a big Muslim community. 'Arabs identify with us Brazilians because we aren't colonizers,' Santana told ANBA about the fact that he speaks to Arabs as an equal, despite being the teacher. According to him, people starting businesses in Arab countries or Brazil encounter similar issues when it comes to costs, resources, and consumer purchasing power. Santana reveals that the favorite flavors of Arabs include dates, pistachio and exotic fruits on the sweeter side. Production must comply with halal rules, and the Brazilian chef instructs entrepreneurs to source certified products. The chef has many Arab friends and acquaintances, most of whom he met while working at kitchens and pastry shops across Europe. He spent five years total between Italy, Spain and France, and says he got asked if he was Arab all the time because of his countenance. 'I'm an Arab from Cajamar,' he quips. Santana was born in the eponymous São Paulo state capital and raised in Cajamar, which is in the São Paulo metro area. The chef has been in the business for about 16 years, prior to which he'd been a civil servant. After attending culinary and pastry schools in Brazil and Argentina, he travelled to Europe to hone his skills and work. He was the first Brazilian to get a Certificate of Professional Aptitude (CAP, acronym in French) in Pastry Arts from France's Ecole Nationale Supérieure de la Pâtisserie (ENSP), where he also taught lessons. Before establishing Escola Sorvete, Santana had done work assisting startup businesses for Italy's ice-cream machine brand Carpigiani. He started his school – in São Paulo's Perdizes neighborhood – about four years ago. 'We're the biggest independent school in the world today,' he says. Most ice-cream schools are currently affiliated with brands or companies. Besides teaching at the Escola Sorvete headquarters, Santana will travel to other cities or countries on demand. In Brazil, he has students from all walks of life – housewives, engineers, economists, dentists, speech therapists –, all of them wishing to start their own businesses. The chef is currently setting up an in-school concept store set to open in late August. Each of the students will manage the place for some time, with assignments ranging from production to serving. For Santana, Brazilians and Arab share the ability to be entrepreneurs. 'Arabs are entrepreneurs anywhere in the world,' he says. The pastry chef lets on great empathy towards Arab people. He says he's read a lot about Islam, and shares lots of anecdotes of experiences he had with his Arab friends back in Europe. 'I always had a really cool relationship with them. I learned about Arab and Muslim culture,' he says. Courses are always ongoing at Escola Sorvete. A crash course is set to run from July 29 to August 2, and then another from August 19 to 23.

(MENAFN- Brazil-Arab News Agency (ANBA)) Isaura Daniel São Paulo – A Brazilian pastry chef is helping North Africa entrepreneurs start ice-cream and popsicle businesses in their countries. Francisco Santana has assisted up-and-coming businesspeople in several countries, including Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. He is currently working with a startup in Egypt. In São Paulo, Santana ownsEscola Sorvete(the Ice Cream School), which offers one-on-one and online courses. He gives guidance to the soon-to-be entrepreneurs on all aspects of starting a business, from product manufacturing – including choice of flavors and machinery – to point of sales. He also teaches one-on-one in other countries, but the bulk of non-Brazilian students get lessons and consulting online. Santana's a master ice cream maker The chef explains that he taught students in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia a few years ago, and is currently teaching online classes to an Egyptian who's about to open a popsicle factory and store under the Top Pop brand. He expects to travel to Cairo later this year to help set up the production line. He was referred for this job by a person in Portugal, and the business is at its early development stages. The classes began about 40 days ago, and Santana believes operation will begin this year. The chef intends to stop by Egypt on his way to Dagestan, Russia, where he's working with a Muslim entrepreneur in another popsicle business. Dagestan is home to a big Muslim community. 'Arabs identify with us Brazilians because we aren't colonizers,' Santana told ANBA about the fact that he speaks to Arabs as an equal, despite being the teacher. According to him, people starting businesses in Arab countries or Brazil encounter similar issues when it comes to costs, resources, and consumer purchasing power. Santana reveals that the favorite flavors of Arabs include dates, pistachio and exotic fruits on the sweeter side. Production must comply with halal rules, and the Brazilian chef instructs entrepreneurs to source certified products. The chef has many Arab friends and acquaintances, most of whom he met while working at kitchens and pastry shops across Europe. He spent five years total between Italy, Spain and France, and says he got asked if he was Arab all the time because of his countenance. 'I'm an Arab from Cajamar,' he quips. Santana was born in the eponymous São Paulo state capital and raised in Cajamar, which is in the São Paulo metro area. The chef has been in the business for about 16 years, prior to which he'd been a civil servant. After attending culinary and pastry schools in Brazil and Argentina, he travelled to Europe to hone his skills and work. He was the first Brazilian to get a Certificate of Professional Aptitude (CAP, acronym in French) in Pastry Arts from France's Ecole Nationale Supérieure de la Pâtisserie (ENSP), where he also taught lessons. Before establishing Escola Sorvete, Santana had done work assisting startup businesses for Italy's ice-cream machine brand Carpigiani. He started his school – in São Paulo's Perdizes neighborhood – about four years ago. 'We're the biggest independent school in the world today,' he says. Most ice-cream schools are currently affiliated with brands or companies. Besides teaching at the Escola Sorvete headquarters, Santana will travel to other cities or countries on demand. In Brazil, he has students from all walks of life – housewives, engineers, economists, dentists, speech therapists –, all of them wishing to start their own businesses. The chef is currently setting up an in-school concept store set to open in late August. Each of the students will manage the place for some time, with assignments ranging from production to serving. For Santana, Brazilians and Arab share the ability to be entrepreneurs. 'Arabs are entrepreneurs anywhere in the world,' he says. The pastry chef lets on great empathy towards Arab people. He says he's read a lot about Islam, and shares lots of anecdotes of experiences he had with his Arab friends back in Europe. 'I always had a really cool relationship with them. I learned about Arab and Muslim culture,' he says. Courses are always ongoing at Escola Sorvete. A crash course is set to run from July 29 to August 2, and then another from August 19 to 23.

Heads of State and Government of all the 55 African countries posing for a group photo on the sidelines of the 32nd ordinary session that took place in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. July 7, 2019. African Union Commission (AUC) CAIRO - 7 July 2019: The main goal of the Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government is the selection of an African country that houses the headquarters of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) whose operational phase will be launched on Sunday. Seven members states, which are Egypt, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ghana, Madagascar and Senegal, have submitted bids to host the secretariat. The decision will be made during the general assembly encompassing the heads of state and government. In his speech at the opening ceremony of the 35th Ordinary Session of the AU Executive Council on Thursday in Niamey, African Union Commission (AUC) Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat said that the idea of creating an “African Economic Community” dates back to 1963. AfCFTA came into force on May 30 after 22 AU member states had ratified it. Afterwards, three other states submitted their instruments of ratification so that the total number of ratifying states became 25. In the aftermath of the launch of the operational phase, traders across Africa will be able to benefit from preferential trade arrangements offered by the AfCFTA. Nevertheless, traders have to bear in mind that the transactions must be among “the Member States that have deposited the instruments of ratification and those that conform to the provisions on rules of origin governing trade in the AfCFTA,” the AU website indicates. A series of statutory and technical meetings are taking place in Niamey on July 4-8. On Monday, a meeting including the AU and the Regional Economic Communities (RECs) will be held. Throughout the summit, matters pertinent to the institutional reform programme that should contribute in the achievement of the vision and goals of Agenda 2063 are discussed. Faki had underlined the AUC’s commitment to work closely with the Permanent Representatives Committee to adequately implement different programmes, and shortly execute and enforce the recommendations of the internal and external auditors.

State Information Service reveals 'flawed methodology' in HRW report on Sinai CAIRO – 3 June 2019: The State Information Service (SIS) has issued a detailed report responding to “false allegations” made in a report released by Human Rights Watch on May 28 on the situation in Sinai, claiming abuses committed by the army amid its war on terrorism. CAIRO – 10 June 2019: Parliament Speaker Ali Abdel Aal criticized the New York-based Human Rights Watch for being politicized and for violations it commits against the charter it was based on.During a session on Sunday, Abdel Aal accused the international non-governmental organization of seeking to remove regimes, saying that it has already contributed to demolishing the regime in many countries.He also asserted that the HRW has a clear program against the stability of the countries, and that its reports are always biased to terrorism."I advise not to waste our time reading such reports. The people of Sinai are honorable and have expressed their patriotism in many situations, and they are true and strong supporters of the army and police," Abdel Aal said.Abdel Aal also criticized those who are responsible for providing this organization with misleading reports at home and abroad, according to him, stressing that all honorable people are not concerned about these reports.This comes shortly after the HRW accused the Egyptian army in Sinai as well as the militants fought by the army of committing human rights violations including war crimes.Egypt has blocked the HRW's website in September 2017, only one day after the organization released a report concerning alleged systematic torture inside Egyptian jails.Parliament's Human Rights Committee member Mohamed al-Koumi said earlier that everyone is now aware that Human Rights Watch holds a hostile attitude towards the Egyptian state, and that its reports are "funded".Koumi accused the "alliance of evil people including the [Muslim] Brotherhood and the states sponsoring the terrorist organization" of being behind the issuance of such "false reports" which aim at obstructing the development of the Egyptian state.The Egyptian authorities designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist group in December 2013, a few months after the ousting of Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated former President Mohamed Morsi and the dispersal of pro-Morsi sit-ins.

News article:
(MENAFN- Daily News Egypt) The streets of the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, were partially deserted during the first day of a massive civil and political disobedience called by protest leaders to end the military council rule. Photos circulating on social media showed that shops, restaurants, and other businesses shut down in response to the strike calls. The Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces (DFCF) also published similar photos showing empty streets with shops, businesses, and even houses closed. Meanwhile, the hashtag #totalcivildisobedience has been trending on Twitter and is being circulated by users and Sudanese activists. The DFCF clarified that a number of workers have been arrested because of their commitment to the general strike, according to the BBC. Some users published photos of Khartoum International airport on Saturday and claimed that the flights were suspended due to the strike. However, the Sudanese news agency (SUNA) reported that air traffic is normal at the capital's airport and they also added that Egyptian and Ethiopian flights are operating normally. EgyptAir also resumed its flights to Sudan after a few days of suspension in light of the political crisis in the country. Early on Sunday, the Sudanese Military Transitional Council described shutting down streets and setting up barriers as a "full-fledged crime," which violates international and humanitarian laws. The military council held the protest group, the DFCF, responsible for these "unsound practices". The council further asserted that it sided with the Sudanese people's will from the beginning and refused the old regime's plans to suppress opposition and protesters. Last week, Sudanese security forces stormed the sit-in held outside the military headquarters in Khartoum. The crackdown killed dozens of protesters and injured hundreds. Protest leaders accused a militia belonging to the military council of killing protesters in a bloody dispersal of their sit-in. According to the Central committee of Sudan doctors (CCSD), a part of the Sudanese Professionals Association, 118 people were killed since last Monday, four of them were killed on the first day of civil disobedience. The CCSD added that 40 of the casualties were allegedly retrieved from the Nile river. However, the Sudanese Ministry of Health stated that only 46 people were killed that Monday. In the aftermath of the military council crackdown against the Khartoum sit-in, the DFCF called for a massive civil and political disobedience starting from Sunday this week to end the military council rule and form a civilian-led government. The alliance called on people to stay home and abstain from work as a part of the civil and political disobedience to protect their colleagues and fulfil their aspiration until the Military Transitional Council is dissolved and becomes a civilian-led government. Since December of last year, Sudanese people, from a wide spectrum of society, swept into the streets in large numbers to initially protest against the high increase in the cost of living. Then, they demanded the toppling of Omar Al-Bashir and his regime, who has been in power since 1989. Al-Bashir was eventually removed by his military generals and he is currently in prison.

While attending a court session on a charge of treason, Egypt's first democratically-elected president Mohammed Morsi was asked to speak. But Morsi collapsed, falling unconscious and died shortly afterwards on his way to hospital. His death comes six years after he was overthrown by the military after his one-year rule. The incident has prompted reactions and messages of condolence all across the globe, with world leaders expressing their shock for his sudden death. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was one of the first to react, offering his condolences to Morsi's family and the people of Egypt. Speaking to the reporters in Istanbul, Erdoğan said current Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah el-Sissi overthrew freely-elected Morsi, executing 50 other Egyptians and putting democracy aside. "Unfortunately, the incident took place in the court room. I first of all I wish God's mercy for our martyred brother Morsi," Erdoğan said. "The West has always been silent in the face of these executions by Sissi. EU member states forbidding execution unfortunately accepted an invitation by this murderer Sissi to attend a meeting in Egypt," Erdoğan said, branding the EU as "hypocrites". Mustafa Şentop, chairman of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, also expressed condolences to "the people of Egypt, the Islamic world and oppressed nations all over the world." Stating that he had received the news of his death with deep sorrow, Şentop said on Twitter that he believed the life and struggle of Morsi would guide those who follow in his footsteps. "What happened in Egypt and to Muhammad Morsi, who struggled for the freedom and welfare of his people, is exemplary for it reveals the true nature and functioning of coup plotters targeting legitimate governments, and unveiling the true face of some of the Western apostles," he said. Declaring Mursi and his friends as winners on the scales of justice and before history, Şentop said the coupists were the real losers and praised Morsi for being a great leader who had the courage to stand on the side of legitimacy. Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu also offered condolences after the demise of Morsi. "The coup took him away from power, but his memory will not be erased from our hearts. The Ummah will not forget his firm stance! Rest in peace Morsi," he wrote on Twitter. The ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party)'s acting chairman Numan Kurtulmuş also called Morsi a "martyr" who had been elected by the legitimate votes of Egyptian people. He also extended condolences over Morsi's death. "Egypt's first elected President Mohammed Morsi, was being tried in courtrooms under the control of the junta after an immoral and unlawful coup. He was martyred in the courtroom," AK Party spokesman Ömer Çelik said, joining other Turkish officials. "Those who raised their voices to the coup and searched for ways of appealing fulfilled and are trying to fulfill their duty. But the so-called democratic world could not pass this test. They were silent against the executions and laid the red carpet to the putschists. This shame will always be written on their forehead," he said. Qatar's ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani expressed his "deep sorrow" following the "sudden death" of Morsi. "We received with deep sorrow the news of the sudden death of former president Dr. Mohamed Morsi. I extend to his family and to the Egyptian people brotherly condolences," Al-Thani wrote on Twitter. Meanwhile, Mohammed Sudan, a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood in London, said Morsi's death was the equivalent of "premeditated murder" saying that the ousted leader, in jail since 2013, was banned from receiving medicine or visits and there was little information about his health condition. Sudan added that Morsi during his trial "has been placed behind glass cage. No one can hear him or know what is happening to him. He hasn't received any visits for a months or nearly a year. He complained before that he doesn't get his medicine." A leading rights group said Morsi's death was tragic but also "predictable" given Egyptian authorities' "failure" to allow medical care. Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director with the Human Rights Watch, tweeted that Morsi's death was "terrible but entirely predictable" given the government "failure to allow him adequate medical care, much less family visits." Morsi since his overthrow appeared only in court, almost always in a soundproof cage. His family said the 67-year-old Morsi suffered from ill health due to harsh conditions, including years of solitary confinement.

News article:
Morsi’s son, Ahmed, confirms the death of his father in a Facebook post. And Mohammed Sudan, leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood in London, described Morsi’s death as “premeditated murder,” saying that the former president was banned from receiving medicine or visits, and there was little information about his health condition. “He has been placed behind glass cage (during trials). No one can hear him or know what is happening to him. He hasn’t received any visits for a months or nearly a year. He complained before that he doesn’t get his medicine. This is premediated murder. This is slow death.” A judicial official says Morsi had asked to speak to the court during the session. The judge permitted it, and Morsi gave a speech saying he had “many secrets” that, if he told them, he would be released, but he adds that he wasn’t telling them because it would harm Egypt’s national security. — AP

News article:
Egypt‘s former President Mohamed Morsi has died after appearing in court in the capital, Cairo, according to authorities. The public prosecutor said the 67-year-old collapsed in a defendants’ cage in the courtroom and was pronounced dead in hospital at 4:50 pm local time (02:50 GMT) on Monday. A medical report showed no apparent recent injuries on his body, the prosecutor said. Mohamed Morsi, ousted president of Egypt, dies suddenly https://t.co/TcAMHWDOHz — The Guardian (@guardian) June 17, 2019 A presenter with Egypt’s state TV said: “Morsi died today while attending a session in his trial on espionage charges. During the session, he was granted permission to address the judge. After the session was adjourned, the former president blacked out and then died. His body was taken to a hospital.” Morsi had a history of health issues, including diabetes and liver and kidney disease. He had suffered from medical neglect during his imprisonment, compounded by the poor conditions in jail. Even if Morsy wasn't murdered, he has suffered deliberate negligence and kept in cruel conditions – denied medication and hospital visits, kept in 23 hrs a day solitary, etc. – which amount to torture. See this from last year: https://t.co/70M51E4nug — Mohamed El Dahshan (@eldahshan) June 17, 2019 There have been various reports over the years that Morsi had been mistreated and tortured in jail, with activists saying on Monday his death should be seen in the context of the Egyptian authorities’ systematic isolation and mistreatment of political detainees. Human Rights Watch called the news of Morsi’s death “terrible” but “entirely predictable”, citing the government’s “failure to allow him adequate medical care”. Morsi became Egypt’s first democratically elected president in 2012, one year after the Arab Spring uprising saw the end of President Hosni Mubarak’s 30-year rule. Mohamed Morsi has dead & it is great sorrow. I send my condolences to Morsi's family, his party Muslim B and Egyptian people.

Morsi served just one year of a four-year term, while the organization to which he belonged, the Muslim Brotherhood, has since been outlawed. Morsi, who was facing at least six trials, had been behind bars for nearly six years and was serving a 20-year prison sentence for a conviction arising from the killing of protesters during demonstrations in 2012. He was also serving a life sentence for espionage in a case related to the Gulf state of Qatar. BREAKING: Egypt's former president Mohamed Morsi dies after court appearance, according to state TV.

His supporters say the charges against him were politically motivated. In November 2016, the Court of Cassation scrapped the life imprisonment sentence for Morsi and 21 other defendants, including some who had received the death penalty in the same case, and ordered a retrial. Throughout his imprisonment, Morsi was only allowed three visits from his family. “The fact that Egypt’s only democratically-elected president ‘collapsed in a defendant’s cage’ as he was being tried for trumped-up charges tells us volumes about the dismal state of democracy and human rights in Egypt, and frankly in much of the Arab world as well,” said Palestinian author and commentator, Ramzy Baroud. “The death of Mohammed Morsi should represent the death of the illusion that the Egyptian dictator Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and similar corrupt Arab rulers – with Sudan being the latest example – have any good intentions towards the revolutionary and democratic currents that are still alive and well in the region,” Baroud also said. “The tragic death of Morsi however is not the end of the story, but rather the beginning of a new phase of struggle in Egypt,” he added.

News article:
A British lawmaker who led a review last year of the detention of deposed Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi said Tuesday there should be an independent international probe into his death. "Dr Morsi's death in custody is representative of Egypt's inability to treat prisoners in accordance with both Egyptian and international law," Conservative MP Crispin Blunt said. He said Cairo "has a duty to explain his unfortunate death and there must be proper accountability for his treatment in custody." "The only step now is a reputable independent international investigation," he said. Blunt chairs the Independent Detention Review Panel, a group of British MPs and lawyers who published a report in March 2018 into how Morsi was being treated in custody. They concluded that the former president, who had a history of ill-health including diabetes, liver and kidney disease, was not receiving adequate medical care. They found that his detention "is below the standard expected by international standards for prisoners, and would constitute cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment." In a statement on Tuesday, Blunt said: "We feared that if Dr Morsi was not provided with urgent medical assistance, the damage to his health may be permanent and possibly terminal. "Sadly, we have been proved right." He added that the panel had found that Morsi's detention conditions could meet the threshold for torture in Egyptian and international law. "We found culpability for torture rests not only with direct perpetrators but those who are responsible for or acquiesce in it," he said. Morsi was Egypt's first democratically elected president who was overthrown in 2013 after a year of divisive rule. He was buried on Tuesday after collapsing in a Cairo courtroom.

News article:
Egypt on Tuesday slammed tweets by the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) on the circumstances of the death of Mohamed Morsi, the country's first freely-elected president, during a court session a day earlier, as reported by Anadolu Agency. Morsi was buried in eastern Cairo early Tuesday amid tight security, hours after he collapsed and died during a court appearance on espionage charges. HRW's Middle East and North Africa Director Sarah Leah Whitson described Morsi's death as "entirely predictable" due to his ill-treatment by the Egyptian authorities. "This is terrible but ENTIRELY predictable, given govt failure to allow him adequate medical care, much less family visits," she said on Twitter. She said the Egyptian government deliberately singled out Morsi for especially harsh treatment and isolation. "…there is a very strong case to be made that this was criminal negligence, deliberate malfeasance in providing #Morsi basic prisoner rights. He was very obviously singled out for mistreatment." #Egypt https://t.co/o2gSNnG622 — Sarah Leah Whitson (@sarahleah1) June 17, 2019 But the State Information Service (SIS) described Whitson's tweets as "lies" and a "political exploitation in the name of human rights". READ: World reacts to the death of Mohammed Morsi In a statement, SIS said Whitson's tweets "contained nothing but false claims that reaffirm HRW's tradition of circulating lies". A leading member of the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood group, Morsi won Egypt's first free presidential election in 2012. Following only one year in office, however, he was ousted and imprisoned in a military coup led by Egypt's then defence minister and current president, Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi. At the time of his death, Morsi faced a host of legal charges, which he, along with numerous human rights groups and independent observers, said were politically motivated. A special report by Reuters shows that more than 100 people died of medical neglect since Sisi took control of Egypt.

News article:
CAIRO: Mohamed Morsi, who died Monday aged 67, was Egypt´s first democratically elected president but spent just one turbulent year in office after the 2011 uprising before the army toppled him. The Islamist´s overthrow was followed by a brutal crackdown that killed hundreds of supporters of his Muslim Brotherhood movement and dealt a major blow to political Islam.Morsi was sentenced to death in May 2015 for his role in jailbreaks during the uprising that ousted his predecessor, longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak. He successfully appealed and was awaiting the final ruling of a retrial when he died in a Cairo hospital after fainting during an “animated” session in court, judicial and security sources said. A veteran activist and engineering professor, Morsi was among the Brotherhood leaders detained during the 18-day anti-Mubarak revolt in 2011, escaping with thousands of inmates who broke out of prison. The son of a farmer, he was not the Brotherhood´s first choice for president. Nicknamed “The Spare Tyre”, Morsi emerged as a compromise candidate to run in Egypt´s first democratic presidential election in 2012. Hailing from the movement´s political wing — the Freedom and Justice Party — he was put forward after one of the Brotherhood´s powerful financiers, Khairat al-Shater, was disqualified on technical grounds. Many voters chose Morsi in a protest vote against Mubarak´s last prime minister, Ahmed Shafiq, and he narrowly won.When taking office in June 2012, the bearded and bespectacled Islamist promised to be president “of all Egyptians” and was feted by cheering crowds in Cairo´s iconic Tahrir Square. But he was soon accused of failing to represent all Egyptians and of trampling the ideals of the anti-Mubarak uprising.His rule was marked by deep divisions in Egyptian society, a crippling economic crisis and often-deadly opposition protests. Derided by some as a “puppet of the Brotherhood”, Morsi irritated the bureaucracy and many ordinary Egyptians by appointing members of the movement to key administrative posts.Months after his election win, Morsi issued a decree that in effect shielded his decisions from judicial review, sparking deadly clashes outside his palace. He was removed by his then-defence minister and army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on July 3, 2013 after millions took to the streets demanding his resignation. Sisi became president a year later. Morsi denounced a “coup” and his supporters insisted he was still the legitimate president of the Arab world´s most populous nation.Hundreds were killed in clashes that erupted when security forces dispersed two pro-Morsi protest camps in Cairo in August 2013. Thousands of Morsi supporters were imprisoned in a crackdown and rights groups accused Sisi´s regime of being even more repressive than the Mubarak authorities.The years following Morsi´s overthrow saw a surge in bombings and shootings targeting security forces, particularly in the northern Sinai Peninsula, a stronghold of the Islamic State group. The jihadists say the attacks are in retaliation for the crackdown on Islamists.Morsi himself was put on trial several times on charges ranging from killing protesters to jailbreaks to spying for Iran, Qatar, and militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. In the first verdict against him, a Cairo court convicted Morsi of inciting violence against protesters during December 2012 clashes after he decreed that his decisions could not be challenged by the judiciary. He was sentenced to 20 years in jail in that case, and later received two life sentences in espionage cases. Morsi steadfastly rejected the authority of Egypt´s courts to try him and launched frequent tirades against Sisi from the dock and accused military chiefs of violating the constitution.“I am Dr Mohamed Morsi, the president of the republic... This was a military coup. The leaders of the coup should be tried,” Morsi said on the opening day of his first trial in November 2013. He was later put in a soundproof glass dock to stop him interrupting the proceedings with outbursts.Born on August 8, 1951 in the village of El-Adwah in the Nile Delta province of Sharqiya, Morsi graduated with an engineering degree from Cairo University. He received a doctorate from the University of Southern California, where he was also an assistant professor in the early 1980s.Morsi first entered the political arena in 2000 when he was elected to parliament as an independent, given the Mubarak-era ban on the Brotherhood. He was a lawmaker until 2005 and served seven months in jail in 2006 for taking part in a demonstration in support of reformist judges.In 2010, Morsi became a spokesman for the Brotherhood and a member of its politburo. He was married with five children and three grandchildren.

Nicknamed “The Spare Tyre”, Morsi emerged as a compromise candidate to run in Egypt´s first democratic presidential election in 2012. Hailing from the movement´s political wing — the Freedom and Justice Party — he was put forward after one of the Brotherhood´s powerful financiers, Khairat al-Shater, was disqualified on technical grounds. Many voters chose Morsi in a protest vote against Mubarak´s last prime minister, Ahmed Shafiq, and he narrowly won.When taking office in June 2012, the bearded and bespectacled Islamist promised to be president “of all Egyptians” and was feted by cheering crowds in Cairo´s iconic Tahrir Square. But he was soon accused of failing to represent all Egyptians and of trampling the ideals of the anti-Mubarak uprising.His rule was marked by deep divisions in Egyptian society, a crippling economic crisis and often-deadly opposition protests. Derided by some as a “puppet of the Brotherhood”, Morsi irritated the bureaucracy and many ordinary Egyptians by appointing members of the movement to key administrative posts.Months after his election win, Morsi issued a decree that in effect shielded his decisions from judicial review, sparking deadly clashes outside his palace. He was removed by his then-defence minister and army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on July 3, 2013 after millions took to the streets demanding his resignation. Sisi became president a year later. Morsi denounced a “coup” and his supporters insisted he was still the legitimate president of the Arab world´s most populous nation.Hundreds were killed in clashes that erupted when security forces dispersed two pro-Morsi protest camps in Cairo in August 2013. Thousands of Morsi supporters were imprisoned in a crackdown and rights groups accused Sisi´s regime of being even more repressive than the Mubarak authorities.The years following Morsi´s overthrow saw a surge in bombings and shootings targeting security forces, particularly in the northern Sinai Peninsula, a stronghold of the Islamic State group. The jihadists say the attacks are in retaliation for the crackdown on Islamists.Morsi himself was put on trial several times on charges ranging from killing protesters to jailbreaks to spying for Iran, Qatar, and militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. In the first verdict against him, a Cairo court convicted Morsi of inciting violence against protesters during December 2012 clashes after he decreed that his decisions could not be challenged by the judiciary. He was sentenced to 20 years in jail in that case, and later received two life sentences in espionage cases. Morsi steadfastly rejected the authority of Egypt´s courts to try him and launched frequent tirades against Sisi from the dock and accused military chiefs of violating the constitution.“I am Dr Mohamed Morsi, the president of the republic... This was a military coup. The leaders of the coup should be tried,” Morsi said on the opening day of his first trial in November 2013. He was later put in a soundproof glass dock to stop him interrupting the proceedings with outbursts.Born on August 8, 1951 in the village of El-Adwah in the Nile Delta province of Sharqiya, Morsi graduated with an engineering degree from Cairo University. He received a doctorate from the University of Southern California, where he was also an assistant professor in the early 1980s.Morsi first entered the political arena in 2000 when he was elected to parliament as an independent, given the Mubarak-era ban on the Brotherhood. He was a lawmaker until 2005 and served seven months in jail in 2006 for taking part in a demonstration in support of reformist judges.In 2010, Morsi became a spokesman for the Brotherhood and a member of its politburo. He was married with five children and three grandchildren.

News article:
A video widely circulated on social media shows a TV anchor from an Egyptian channel owned by the General Intelligence Service reading from a teleprompter and ending with the words "sent from a Samsung device" leading to speculation that the script was Whatsapped to news editors by a government official. Virtually all newspapers in #Egypt ran the same 42-word story on the death of #MohammedMorsi. It was WhatsApped to news editors by a govt official. This TV anchor – reading from a teleprompter – even ended her #Morsi report: "Sent from a Samsung device." pic.twitter.com/gJp2ozzLku — Stefan Simanowitz (@StefSimanowitz) June 18, 2019 Egypt's first democratically elected President Mohammed Morsi died in a courtroom on Monday after six years in prison spent in solitary confinement. Morsi, who had liver and kidney disease, was consistently denied medical attention whilst incarcerated. Obituary: Mohammed Morsi, Egypt's first, democratic president Despite the fact that he was Egypt's first democratically elected president, Egyptian newspapers all ran the same 42-word story on Morsi's death. The story only featured as front page news in one newspaper, Al-Masry Al-Youm, in Egypt. A well trained press: The death of former president Mohamed Morsi only makes front page news in one newspaper today in Egypt. pic.twitter.com/DUvlKpI4n0 — Sharif Kouddous (@sharifkouddous) June 18, 2019 One had a seven line story in the crime and accident section of the publication: State-owned media has #Morsi death published in 7 lines in the crime/accident news section Regardless of state political stance on ex-president, this is major news for any news outlet that has a minimum of professionalism. Not in #Egypt https://t.co/k7jcHaJXGq — Amira El-Fekki (@afekki) June 18, 2019 The articles did not mention that Morsi was a former president, instead referred to him as "the accused" or "the deceased". Media outlets did not publish an official statement from the government. Under incumbent President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi Egypt has tightened its grip on the media in the ongoing battle for public opinion. Security services have bought media properties, suggested mandatory training for members of the press at a Cairo military academy and passed an anti-terror law under which journalists could face jail time for publishing news contrary to government statements. READ: World reacts to the death of Mohammed Morsi Whilst the Egyptian press support Al-Sisi, the foreign press and social media have proven harder to get a grip on, so authorities have resorted to blocking access to over 500 websites on the grounds that they are a threat to national security. In the aftermath of Morsi's death, Egyptian authorities added the Turkish state television TRT Arabi's website and Anadolu Agency to this list. The move comes as Morsi supporter Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wished "God's mercy onto the martyr Mohamed Morsi, who took part in one of the greatest democratic struggles in history." Erdogan blamed Egypt's "tyrants" for his death and said they were "cowardly" for burying his body with just a few family and friends present. Egypt ranks 163 out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index.

News article:
Egypt's first democratically elected president and top Muslim Brotherhood official Mohammed Morsi did not die of natural causes but instead was murdered, Turkey's leader claimed Wednesday. At an election rally in Istanbul, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed he was murdered, citing evidence the deposed Egyptian president allegedly "flailed" in a Cairo courtroom for 20 minutes on Monday and nobody assisted him. "Unfortunately, Mohammed Morsi was on the ground of the courtroom flailing for 20 minutes," he told the crowd. "No official there intervened. Morsi did not (die) naturally, he was killed." EGYPT'S OUSTED PRESIDENT MOHAMMED MORSI DEAD AFTER COLLAPSING IN COURT Morsi, 67, hailed from Egypt's largest Islamist group, the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, and was elected president in 2012 in the country's first free elections following the Arab Spring and ouster of longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak. The military, however, toppled Morsi in 2013 after massive protests and crushed the Brotherhood in a major crackdown, arresting him and many others of the group's leaders. The 67-year-old was buried on Tuesday under heavy security a day after his dramatic death inside the courtroom. Morsi's family attended funeral prayers in the mosque of Cairo's Tora prison, followed by the burial at a cemetery in the Egyptian capital's eastern district of Nasr City, Abdul-Moneim Abdel-Maqsoud, a member of Morsi's defense team, told the Associated Press. Morsi's son Ahmed said security agencies refused to allow Morsi to be buried at the family's cemetery in his hometown of Adwa in Sharqia province, and instead had him interred at a Cairo cemetery dedicated to prominent Islamists. Dozens of people performed the absentee funeral prayer amid tight security in Adwa, according to residents and videos circulated online. EGYPT AGREES TO PAY ISRAEL $500 MILLION TO END GAS DISPUTE During his years in prison, Morsi, who was known to have diabetes, was often held in solitary confinement and was largely barred from receiving visitors. His family was only allowed to visit three times. While in detention, Morsi continued to appear in court on a range of charges. Morsi's Brotherhood has accused the government of "assassinating" him through years of poor prison conditions. The group demanded an international investigation into Morsi's death on Monday and called on Egyptians to protest outside Egyptian embassies across the world. Late on Monday, Egypt's chief prosecutor said Morsi's body would be examined to determine the cause of his death. State TV, citing an unnamed medical source, said he died after suffering a heart attack. Erdogan said Wednesday that Turkey would do everything in its power to ensure Egypt faces trial in Morsi's death. He also called on the Islamic Cooperation Organization to "take the necessary action" over Morsi's death." An Egyptian judicial official told the Associated Press that Morsi had just addressed the court, speaking from the glass cage he is kept in during sessions and warning that he had "many secrets" he could reveal before collapsing minutes later. Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, called Tuesday for a "prompt, impartial, thorough and transparent investigation" into Morsi's death. Human Rights Watch also criticized Egyptian authorities for failing to provide adequate medical care for Morsi as "horrific."

News article:
GENEVA: The UN human rights office called Tuesday for an “independent inquiry” into the death of former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, who died in state custody. “Any sudden death in custody must be followed by a prompt, impartial, thorough and transparent investigation carried out by an independent body to clarify the cause of death,” said Rupert Colville, spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Chair of UK detention panel calls for Morsi probe: A British lawmaker who led a review last year of the detention of deposed Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi said Tuesday there should be an independent international probe into his death. “Dr Morsi’s death in custody is representative of Egypt’s inability to treat prisoners in accordance with both Egyptian and international law,” Conservative MP Crispin Blunt said. He said Cairo “has a duty to explain his unfortunate death and there must be proper accountability for his treatment in custody”. “The only step now is a reputable independent international investigation,” he said. Thousands in Istanbul pray for ex-Egyptian president Morsi: Thousands joined in prayer in Istanbul on Tuesday for former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi who died the previous day after collapsing during a trial hearing in a Cairo court. The prayers, called by Turkey’s religious authority Diyanet, took place in the city’s Fatih mosque. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a close ally of Morsi, is due to attend afternoon prayers there. Ankara’s relations with Cairo deteriorated after the Egyptian military, then led by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, ousted Morsi in 2013. Sisi then became president. Erdogan on Monday called Morsi a “martyr” and blamed Egypt’s “tyrants” for his death. Turkey has strongly denounced Morsi’s ouster, with Erdogan calling it a “coup”. On Tuesday, the Turkish leader lashed out at the West for “merely watching Morsi’s toppling and his suffering in a one-room cell”. Morsi quietly buried in Cairo: Egypt’s first democratically elected president Mohamed Morsi was buried Tuesday, as calls mounted for an independent investigation into the causes of his death after he collapsed in a Cairo courtroom. The Islamist leader, who was overthrown in 2013 after a year of divisive rule and later charged with espionage, was buried at a cemetery in eastern Cairo’s Medinat Nasr, one of his lawyers said. Abdel Moneim Abdel Maksoud said family members had washed Morsi’s body and prayed the last rites early Tuesday morning at the Leeman Tora Hospital. That lies near the prison where Egypt’s first civilian president, a prominent Muslim Brotherhood member, had been held for six years in solitary confinement and deteriorating health.

News article:
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Thursday urged the U.N. to launch an official investigation into the death of Egypt's first and only democratically elected President Mohammed Morsi. Speaking to journalists at a media event, Erdoğan said Egyptian authorities did not intervene while Morsi suffered for more than 20 minutes before he fell unconscious, and eventually died. Morsi reportedly died from a heart attack Monday during a court session. The country's state television reported early Tuesday that Morsi was "suffering from a benign tumor, had continuous medical attention and his death was caused by a heart attack." He was buried in Nasr City, east of Cairo, early Tuesday morning. "They didn't make the slightest intervention as the country's first democratically elected president suffered for more than 20 minutes. They didn't deliver his remains to his family or let him be buried in his hometown per his will," Erdoğan said, blaming Abdel Fattah el-Sissi for Morsi's death. "Sissi is a tyrant, not a democrat," Erdoğan said. "I hope the U.N., which found Turkey's stance on Jamal Khashoggi's murder right, will also handle the suspicious death of Morsi," Erdoğan said. "We won't allow Morsi's death to be forgotten just as we have not allowed late Jamal Khashoggi's death to be forgotten," he added. Erdoğan said Turkey would also use every available resource within the confines of international law to shed light onto Morsi's death. Morsi was elected president in 2012 but was ousted in a military coup a year later. The military, then led by incumbent President Sissi, crushed the Muslim Brotherhood movement in a major crackdown, arresting Morsi and many others of the group's leaders, who have been in prison undergoing multiple trials ever since the coup. According to his family, Morsi had diabetes and kidney disease and had not been provided with proper medical treatment. Amnesty International and other rights groups have called for a fair, transparent and comprehensive investigation into Morsi's death and raised questions about his treatment in prison. Egypt's government has dismissed accusations that he was badly treated.

News article:
(MENAFN- Jordan Times) ANKARA — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday vowed to try to ensure the Egyptian government is tried in international courts for the death of former president Mohamed Morsi, who suffered a fatal heart attack in a Cairo court earlier this week. 'Muhamed Morsi flailed on the courtroom floor for 20 minutes and the authorities did not help him. This is why I say Morsi did not die, he was murdered,' Erdogan told supporters at an election rally in Istanbul. 'We, as Turkey, will follow this issue and do everything possible for Egypt to be tried in international courts for Morsi's death,' he said, calling on the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to take action towards this end. He spoke a day after he called Morsi a 'marytr' and said he did not believe the former president died due to natural causes. Morsi, a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood Islamist group which is now banned in Egypt, died on Monday after collapsing in a Cairo court while on trial on espionage charges. The 67-year-old — the first democratically elected head of state in Egypt's modern history — had been in jail since the army commanded by Egypt's current president Abdel Fattah Sisi toppled him in 2013 after barely a year in power following mass protests against his rule. Erdogan's Islamist-rooted AK Party supported Morsi's short-lived Egyptian government, and many Brotherhood members and supporters have fled to Turkey since its activities were banned in Egypt. Erdogan added he would raise the issue at the G-20 summit in Japan at the end of the month. Rights groups have called for an investigation into Morsi's death and raised questions about his treatment in prison. Egypt's government has dismissed accusations that he was badly treated.

News article:
The Egyptian authorities have blocked Turkey's TRT Arabi and Anadolu Agency websites, the Ankara-based International Association for Media and Communication (IAMCR) announced yesterday. "As part of the ongoing censorship on media in Egypt, TRT Arabi and Anadolu Agency were blocked by the Egyptian regime," IAMCR said, condemning what it described as "a coup attempt against media freedom." IAMCR explained that the move had come following the websites' coverage of the death of the former Egyptian first freely-elected president, Mohamed Morsi. The former president of Egypt was kept in a cell for 23 hours a day since his overthrow in 2013 and consistently denied medical attention for his diabetes, kidney and liver disease. Turkey: Protesters at Egypt Embassy over Morsi's death Morsi collapsed during a court session on Monday, was denied first aid for up to 30 minutes, then taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. Expressing its resentment, IAMCR added that the "undemocratic practices in Egypt have crossed the red lines." The media group called on the Western world "to publicly acknowledge the existence of media censorship in Egypt." In recent years, the Egyptian authorities have blocked hundreds of websites and news sources in what local and international human rights groups describe as part of "a wider policy to restrict freedom, repress dissent, and limit access to information." The number of blocked platforms and websites in Egypt is on the rise, with over 500 banned websites. The ban list includes news websites, blogs, as well as VPN and proxy service providers offering unrestricted and secure access to the internet without fear of surveillance.

Abdullah, son of late Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, has accused incumbent President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and a number of officials of "killing" his father, Anadolu Agency reports. Morsi, the first democratically elected president, died on Monday after falling into a coma inside his soundproof glass cage during his trial on "espionage" charges. In a Thursday tweet, the late president's son named a number of officials whom he called "partners" of al-Sisi "in killing the martyr president". He particularly accused incumbent and former interior ministers Mahmoud Tawfiq and Magdy Abdel Ghaffar, respectively. The names also included judges Shirin Fahmy, Shaaban al-Shami and Ahmed Sabry as well as Attorney General Nabil Sadek and Abbas Kamel, head of intelligence service. READ: Egypt denies family visits to prison in wake of Morsi's death Egyptian authorities have yet to comment on claims by Morsi's son. Morsi, a leading member of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, won Egypt's first free presidential election in 2012. After only a year in office, however, he was ousted and imprisoned in a military coup led by then-Defense Minister Sisi. At the time of his death, Morsi faced a host of legal charges, which he, along with numerous human rights groups and independent observers, said were politically motivated.

News article:
Egypt's first democratically-elected president Mohammed Morsi was threatened by Egyptian officials days before he died, the Middle East Eye said in a piece late Tuesday. The MEE claimed that Morsi was pressured to surrender his legitimacy as the elected president of Egypt and bow down to the regime of Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, but he rejected. Morsi was told to disband the Muslim Brotherhood or "face the consequences," the MEE said in the report. He refused to talk about closing down the Muslim Brotherhood, saying he "is not the leader of the movement." Morsi dismissed the threat and he was dead after a couple of days. Morsi has been in prison undergoing multiple trials ever since the military led by then-Defense Minister and Chief of Staff Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sissi ousted him in July 2013 and launched a massive crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood. Monday's session was part of a retrial, being held inside Cairo's Tura Prison, on charges of espionage with the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas. The Muslim Brotherhood has accused Egyptian authorities of being responsible for Morsi's "deliberate slow death." The Egyptian authorities "put him in solitary confinement... they withheld medication and gave him disgusting food... they did not give him the most basic human rights," the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party said in a statement published on its website. Senior Muslim Brotherhood official Amr Darrag called for an international expert team to examine Morsi's body. Amnesty International also called for a fair, transparent and comprehensive Egyptian investigation into Morsi's death. Egypt's government has dismissed all accusations that he was badly treated. Morsi's son Abdullah has accused Sissi, who took over as president in 2014, and a number of officials of "killing" his father. Following Morsi's sudden death on June 17, Turkish leaders have decried his mistreatment and suggested that his death was no accident. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, calling Morsi a "martyr," extended condolences to his family and the Egyptian people. "Unfortunately, the incident took place in the court room. I first of all I wish God's mercy for our martyred brother Morsi," he said. "The West has always been silent in the face of these executions by Sissi. The EU member states forbidding execution unfortunately accepted an invitation by this murderer el-Sissi to attend a meeting in Egypt," he said, criticizing the EU for being "hypocrites" and calling Sissi a "tyrant" who took power in a "coup" and trampled on democracy.

News article:
(Adds number of arrests, political analyst quote) By Amina Ismail and Mohamed Abdellah CAIRO, June 25 (Reuters) - Egypt detained a leading opposition figure and allies on Tuesday on charges of plotting to bring down the government, but opposition groups said the arrests aimed to stymie their preparations for parliamentary elections next year. Zyad Elelaimy, a prominent member of the Social Democratic Party and the Civil Democratic Movement, was held along with at least seven others, the interior ministry said in a statement. Elelaimy, who was also a leading member of the 2011 protests that unseated long time ruler Hosni Mubarak, was arrested minutes after leaving a friend's house in Cairo's Maadi district around 2:20 a.m., eyewitnesses said. "About two minutes after he left we heard him calling us. We looked from our balcony and we saw him being pushed into a civilian car by a large number of people in civilian clothes," a friend, Soha Bayoumi, told Reuters. "It seems that they were waiting for him, it was an ambush," Bayoumi added, saying that the people who arrested Elelaimy identified themselves as national security agents. The interior ministry accused Elelaimy and seven others of involvement in a plan fomented and financed through Muslim Brotherhood leaders abroad "to carry out violent and disorderly acts against state institutions simultaneously with creating a state of revolutionary momentum." The Civil Democratic Movement (CDM), a coalition of Egyptian opposition parties and figures, denied Elelaimy and the others arrested had any connections with the Muslim Brotherhood, which was banned and declared a terrorist organization in Egypt in 2013. One of Elelaimy's colleagues said he believed the arrest was linked to the coalition's move to seek more members to prepare for parliamentary elections next year. "We have nothing to do with the Brotherhood ... I am truly astonished and I don't know why security would be upset that we want to take part in the elections in the framework of the law and constitution," said CDM member Khaled Dawoud, adding that the group has had only one meeting and was planning for another soon. Human rights lawyer Gamal Eid, who is representing some of the defendants, said at least 10 people were arrested in recent days and were being questioned at state security prosecution headquarters on Tuesday. Eid said the charges include financing a terrorist organization and publishing false news. Eid said the case is "fabricated" and aims at "spreading fear" among the opposition ahead of the anniversary of the June 30, 2013 uprising that toppled President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood. Last week, Mursi suffered a fatal heart attack https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-mursi/egyptian-ex-president-mursi-buried-in-cairo-as-islamists-mourn-idUSKCN1TJ0CE in court at a Cairo prison, authorities said. The Muslim Brotherhood described Mursi's death as "full-fledged murder." Opposition figures and activists Hisham Foad, Hossam Moeness, Omar el-Shenety, Ahmed el-Akabawy and Hassan al-Barbarry were among those who had been arrested in recent days. Since becoming president in 2014, former army chief President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has overseen a crackdown that has swept up Islamists and liberal opponents. At least 60,000 people have been jailed, according to Human Rights Watch. Sisi has denied holding political prisoners and his backers say the measures were necessary to stabilise Egypt. "They regularly arrest people to scare anyone else who consider challenging them, even according to the highly restrictive rules they've set as through the parliament," said Timothy Kaldas, non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. "They want to destroy any hope in the public that they have a place in Egypt's political life," Kaldas said.

The ministry identified and arrested a number of people involved with 19 illegal companies and economic entities involved in the plot Egypt's Ministry of Interior issued a statement on Tuesday revealing that it has foiled a plot orchestrated by leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, along with other elements, attempting to disrupt the country's national economy. The ministry's statement confirmed it has arrested a number of people who are involved with 19 different illegal companies and economic entities affiliated with the MB's leadership and cadres. The ministry said it arrested Mostafa Abdel-Moez Abdel-Sattar, Osama Abdel-Aal El-Akabawy, Ahmed Abdel-Geliel El-Ghanam, Omar Mohamed El-Shiniety, Hossam Moenes Saad, Hesham Fouad Abdel-Aleem and Hassan Mohamed Hassan and Ziad El-Aleimy, a former parliament member in the 2012 People's Assembly. Among those arrested are an aide to sitting MP Ahmed Tantawy and other employees of his office. They are all currently under investigation. The ministry said it has seized organisational documents and electronic devices. The total financial transactions of the involved entities amount to EGP 250 million ($15 million). According to the statement, the scheme was mainly focused on building paths of illegal cash flow from abroad. This falls in line with the MB, fugitive forces, and other enemies of the state financing acts of violence and rebellions against state institutions. The ministry also announced that is has uncovered a hostile scheme dubbed "Plan of Hope," which was organised by fugitive MB leaders in coordination with those who claim to represent civil political forces. The ministry said that Egypt's High State Security Prosecution will carry out investigations in the case. An informed source told Ahram Online that the MB is trying to regain a foothold on the ground as an attempt to disrupt Egypt's stability, as well as that of the Arab region. The source noted that this comes with the involvement of MB members and former MP Ziad El-Aleimy, in cooperation with other civil political powers. "The MB terrorist organisation's finances are being used by countries that support terrorism in order to infiltrate Egypt's economy and create a state of chaos with the cooperation of civil political forces and a current member of parliament," the source added.

CAIRO, Egypt — Eight people have been detained by the Egyptian authorities on accusations of belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood and helping to fund a plot to overthrow the state, a judicial source told AFP. Those being held included businessmen, journalists and political figures, who have been placed in temporary detention for 15 days, the source said, while Amnesty International described the “chilling” arrests as politically motivated. The detentions came after the interior ministry said 19 businesses were raided by police on Tuesday in the capital Cairo and the cities of Alexandria and Ismaila. The raids were in response to the businesses allegedly funding a plot “intent on overthrowing the state and its institutions” this month, the interior ministry said in a statement. They were part of a plan along with groups “claiming to represent civil political forces” which sought to carry out “violent acts and unrest against the state”, it added.

The raids were in response to the businesses allegedly funding a plot “intent on overthrowing the state and its institutions” this month, the interior ministry said in a statement. They were part of a plan along with groups “claiming to represent civil political forces” which sought to carry out “violent acts and unrest against the state”, it added.

The government did not detail the type of businesses targeted, but said they were affiliated with the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group. Prominent human rights lawyer Zyad el-Elaimy, who was among those arrested, was visiting a friend in Maadi, a Cairo suburb, when police detained him in the early hours of Tuesday, his mother Ekram Youssef said. Advertisement “Some people grabbed him so he started shouting to his friend. He eventually cooperated with them once the friend came,” she told AFP. Elaimy played a key role in the movement that unseated autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011 and he subsequently served as a lawmaker for a year. Hassan Barbary, another of those arrested, has initially been charged with joining and funding a terror group, according to the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms. Two of the eight detained were reportedly facing accusations of collaborating to spread fake news. Rights watchdog Amnesty slammed Egyptian authorities for their “systematic persecution and brutal crackdown on anyone who dares to criticize them.” “The crackdown leaves no doubt about the authorities’ vision for political life in Egypt; an open air prison with no opposition, critics, or independent reporting allowed,” said Magdalena Mughrabi, the group’s North Africa research director. Advertisement Since the 2013 military overthrow of elected Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi — who died last week after collapsing in court — there has been a widespread crackdown on dissent. Thousands of Islamists as well as secularists have been jailed following trials criticized internationally, while Egypt says it is countering terrorism.

Egyptian police - Reuters KUWAIT CITY, June 26 (MENA) - Kuwaiti newspapers out Wednesday highlighted Egyptian authorities' success in foiling a plot by Muslim Brotherhood to target state facilities during celebrations of June 30 revolution anniversary. Headlined "Egypt foils MB plot to target Egyptian economy", Al Seyassah newspaper said the Egyptian Interior Ministry succeeded in targeting 19 economic entities run by MB leaderships secretly to harm national economy. The ministry released a videotape shedding light on these companies and some Egyptian figures, including former lawmakers and fugitive MB leaderships. Al Nahar newspaper also talked about the MB scheme known as "Al Amal Plan". The scheme is based on uniting the ranks of the members of the terrorist group and providing them with the financial support they need from the revenues and profits of some economic entities that are run by the group's leaders and their affiliates to target the state's facilities and institutions during the celebrations. Information received by the National Security Service revealed that the plan is focused on establishing routes for the financial funds sent illegally from abroad by some hostile countries to work on carrying out violent and riot acts across the country to disrupt celebrations of the revolution's anniversary. The scheme aimed at launching inciting campaigns in the media and through the social media and satellite TV channels that are broadcast from outside the country. The Interior Ministry's statement identified some of the MB leaders who are involved in the plan including Mahmoud Hussein, Ali Bateekh, anchor Moataz Matar, Mohammed Nasser as well as the fugitive leader of El Ghad Party Ayman Nour.

News article:
The children of high-profile Muslim Brotherhood members being detained in the same prison as Egypt's first democratically elected President Mohammed Morsi, before his sudden death last week, say that they fear for their parents' health. Morsi, 67, died after collapsing during a court appearance at Cairo's Tora prison complex. He had been in prison undergoing multiple trials since the military led by then-Defense Minister and Chief of Staff Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi ousted him in July 2013 and launched a massive crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters. Other senior Brotherhood members are jailed in Tora's maximum-security "Scorpion" wing, often in solitary confinement. The families of four detainees, all at Tora, said their relatives were being held under extremely poor conditions, deprived of adequate health care. As Reuters reported, an Interior Ministry spokesman and Egypt's State Information Service, which handles relations with the foreign media, did not respond to several calls and messages seeking comment about the families' accounts, including accusations that some of their relatives needed surgery for abuse suffered in detention. Egyptian officials have previously denied mistreating prisoners or neglecting their health. The Egyptian authorities "put Morsi in solitary confinement... they withheld medication and gave him disgusting food... they did not give him the most basic human rights," the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party said in a statement published on its website. The death of Morsi on June 17 has caused massive backlash from the international community as it was widely speculated that his death was the result of mistreatment rather than natural causes. Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, a 68-year-old former presidential candidate who ran for election against Morsi in 2012, is being held in Tora's Al Mazra wing. Arrested in February 2018, he is being held in pretrial detention over alleged connections with the now-banned Brotherhood. He denies the charges, according to his son Ahmed. Aboul Fotouh has diabetes, hypertension, heart and respiration problems, which require him to sleep with an oxygen machine that he brought with him but does not work properly in the high temperatures of the prison cell, Ahmed told Reuters. "The doctor said he has to undergo a prostate operation but they are not allowing it," he said. "They are deliberately not protecting his health... If they continue treating him like this, it will lead to the same result as Morsi," he added. Former Morsi aide Essam al-Haddad has been in solitary confinement since his arrest six years ago and was moved to a solitary cell in the Tora hospital complex after having several heart attacks, his son Abdullah said. "His health has deteriorated significantly," Abdullah said. Another of Haddad's sons, Gihad, a Brotherhood spokesman, is held in Scorpion, where he suffered physical abuse after writing an opinion piece defending the movement for The New York Times in 2017, Abdullah said. "He was beaten and physically tortured," he continued, adding that: "He says that his knee feels numb and he isn't getting any therapy... he is on the verge of losing his leg." A Cairo court overturned life sentences for espionage against Essam and Gihad in 2016, but both men are being retried. According to one Human Rights Watch (HRW) estimate published in 2017, at least 60,000 people have been detained on political grounds since 2013. Liberal opposition figures swept up in el-Sissi's crackdown on dissent are also being held in the Tora prisons. Morsi was being held in Tora's al-Molhaq prison and had been in solitary confinement since his arrest in 2013, according to his family. He had previously fainted during hearings, suffered diabetic comas, developed a condition in his left eye, and had back and neck pain from sleeping on the bare floor of his cell, according to statements from HRW, citing Morsi's court testimony and the rights group's interviews with relatives. His family was only allowed to visit three times in six years, his son Abdullah told Reuters, accusing authorities of "gross medical negligence." The State Information Service said last week that Morsi's last official health request in November 2017, to be treated at his own expense, had been approved, and that an official report from the same year found he was suffering from diabetes but otherwise healthy. A year later, a panel of British members of Parliament that reviewed evidence about Morsi's detention conditions in 2018 at the request of Morsi's family found he was receiving "inadequate medical care," including for diabetes and liver disease, and that this was what "likely led to premature death."

News article:
Muslim Brotherhood supporters in the United States continue to mourn former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi’s death last week. Morsi suffered an apparent heart attack during a court proceding where he faced espionage charges. Some supporters say it took more than 20 minutes for Morsi to receive medical attention. Human Rights Watch claims he died after “years of government mistreatment, prolonged solitary confinement, inadequate medical care” and more. Morsi had served one year as president before the Egyptian army, responding to massive street protests, toppled his Muslim Brotherhood-led government in 2013. His supporters accuse Egypt of murdering Morsi, implying harsh conditions in the country’s jails triggered an apparent heart attack. Somehow, though, mourners at a memorial service last Wednesday in New Jersey, found a way to make Morsi’s death about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The event was almost entirely in Arabic, videos posted to YouTube show. The Investigative Project on Terrorism translated what was said. “Dr. Mohamed Morsi was killed because he challenged the world order and said ‘No, we will not leave Gaza alone. We will not leave Gaza alone,'” said Hani Elkadi, president of the Brotherhood-supporting Egyptian Americans for Freedom and Justice (EAFJ). Elkadi’s consistent Brotherhood support includes social media posts mourning the death of a leader who spun off two terrorist branches and encouraging Egyptian youth to wage jihad against the military government. Morsi had been out of power six years when he died last week. His thoughts on Gaza were relevant for a relatively brief time. Elkadi also placed Morsi among the Brotherhood’s most revered martyrs – Sayyid Qutb, who was executed by Egypt in 1966 for plotting against the Nasser government, and Brotherhood founder Hassan al-Banna, who was assassinated in 1949. Morsi’s image dominated a giant poster at the service, which drew about 50 people to a meeting hall in North Bergen, N.J. “Condolences and absentee funeral prayer of Dr. Mohamed Morsi, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt,” the poster said in Arabic. It claimed to speak for “The Muslim Community in the United States of America.” Said Abbasy, vice president of the Egyptian Americans for Democracy and Human Rights (EADHR), a group similar to Elkadi’s EAFJ, also spent part of his eulogy making up a story about Israel’s glee over Morsi’s passing and issuing a threat. “An Israeli Zionist report came out today from the tombs,” Abbasy said. “They are happy that President Mohamed Morsi is lying in a tomb. They are telling Israel it is safe now. By Allah, you will not be safe. By Allah, you will not be safe as, Allah willing, the blood of the martyr President Mohamed Morsi will be a curse upon you, and upon all the criminals and the hypocrites, and we will pursue our revolution, as revolutionists, as freemen, we will continue the path.” Morsi did reopen the border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, but never took aggressive action against Israel. He left Egypt’s 1978 peace treaty with Israel intact. Many Egyptians, especially those who marched against him, believed that Morsi spent his time in office trying to entrench the Muslim Brotherhood’s control at the expense of economic and quality of life needs of Egyptians. He pushed a theocratic constitution and tried to seize emergency powers over the courts. He was a fallback candidate, chosen as the Brotherhood’s presidential nominee only after the Brotherhood’s original presidential choice was disqualified. In death, however, the New Jersey activists elevated him to a hero of the Palestinian cause. Across the country, the Islamic Center of Southern California (ICSC) allegedly prohibited Khaled Abou El Fadl from talking about Morsi during a sermon El Fadl was invited to give after Friday prayer. El Fadl blasted the mosque and its leaders during a 50-minute video posted on YouTube. The mosque prefers to avoid divisive political discussions after prayer unless they directly affect American Muslims, El Fadl said he was told. That’s tantamount to censoring him, he said, calling the action “authoritarian and despotic garbage.” Mosque leaders are “ignorant idiots” who don’t represent Islam, El Fadl said. “You are an embarrassment to Islam.” He wasn’t a Morsi supporter, he said, but he did want to talk about Egypt’s human rights record. The New Jersey mourners also blasted Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s government, but their support for Morsi and the Brothers repeatedly was made clear. Mohammad Qatanani, a Hamas-supporter who serves as imam at the Islamic Center of Passaic County, said Morsi was “known for his love for Egypt, and his love to humanity, and his love of truth, his love for democracy, and for his love to support the oppressed in Syria, in Palestine, and everywhere. He was truly a human being, he did not lose anything. He gained martyrdom, but Egypt lost him, the Muslim ummah [nation] lost him, the pious men on earth lost him, Palestine lost him and Syria lost him.” Morsi’s love of democracy appeared limited, given the anti-democratic acts he took in office and his failure to protect Egypt’s Coptic Christian minority. Qatanani, meanwhile, called for a new intifada – a violent Palestinian uprising – during a 2017 rally in New York: “Our message to the Palestinian authority, you have to stop all kinds of peace process, no peace process and negotiation with the occupation in Palestine. Oslo has to be stopped and to be finished. We have to start a new intifada. Intifada, intifada!” Morsi, Syrian doctor Fahmy Khairullah said at last week’s memorial, was no “regular man nor a passerby. But rather, we are sorrowful and aching to mourn a man who is equal to a whole nation, a man who has revived his nation that has been engulfed by the beasts of ZioCrusades. And, by the way, many people refrain from mentioning Zionism and Crusaders claiming, ‘oh brother, it’s not right.’ But I will call things by their names. He has renewed hope for people who have been engulfed by the beasts of ZioCrusades and by the moral and religious decay in the time of fake modernization.” Morsi, he said, “has joined the ranks of martyrs. He will gladly meet with his lord. He must have joined the leaders of the ummah today with the omnipotent God, such as [Hamas spiritual leader] Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, may Allah rest his soul.” Morsi’s American mourners follow groups that have “freedom,” “justice” and “democracy” in their names. But the groups’ rhetoric consistently shows a hatred for Israel and support for political violence, by Egyptians, Palestinians and more. Their sadness over Morsi’s death was no exception.

Compiled photo, from left: HishamFouad, Omar al-Shenety, Zyad al-Elemy CAIRO – 2 July 2019: The number of defendants accused of joining the so-called Al-Amal (Hope) Plan cell, believed to be formed by the Muslim Brotherhood group, has increased to 18 people, legal sources revealed, 13 of whom were imprisoned, and five are runaways. The Muslim Brotherhood has been designated by the Egyptian state as a terrorist group since late 2013, following violent clashes between their supporters and the police forces in August of the same year. The defendants are accused of joining and funding a terrorist group that was unlawfully established, and also using social media platforms to disseminate fake news. This comes after Taqwa Abdel Rady and Lo’yaSabry, two female defendants in the case were detained for 15 days pending investigation. Moreover, the State Security Prosecution ordered seizing the funds of a number of defendants including politicians and economy figures in the case. It also ordered banning the defendants from travelling outside the country. Defendants in the case include Moustafa Abdel Mo'ez, Osama al-Akabawi, Omar al-Shenety, Hossam Mo'nis, Zyad al-Elemy, Hisham Fouad, Hassan Barbari, Ahmed Tammam, Khaled Abu Shadi, Lo'ya Sabry and Taqwa Abdel Rady. The runaways are Ayman Nour, owner and manager of pro-Muslim Brotherhood Al-Sharq TV; pro-Muslim Brotherhood TV presenters Mo'taz Matar and Mohamed Nasser; and Muslim-Brotherhood-affiliated figures Mahmoud Hussein and Ali Bateekh. Security authorities also ordered moving the defendants, including Qassem Abdel Kafi, to Cairo's Tura Prison, after the prosecution had ordered detaining the defendants for 15 days pending investigations. Hope Plan, according to a security statement, is a terrorist plot by Muslim Brotherhood leaders to target the state facilities institutions. The arrested figures are believed to be Muslim Brotherhood operatives. According to a statement by the Interior Ministry, the scheme worked on uniting the Brotherhood group members, funding them from the revenues of some economic entities as they sought to topple the state and its institutions on the June 30 Uprising anniversary. Information received by the National Security Service revealed that the plan is focused on establishing routes for the financial funds sent illegally from abroad by some hostile countries to work on carrying out violent acts across the country to disrupt celebrations of the revolution's anniversary, the statement said. The statement also noted that the scheme aimed at launching "inciting" campaigns in the media and on the social media and satellite TV channels that are broadcast from outside the country. Acting on such information, security forces, in coordination with the High State Security Prosecution, targeted 19 economic entities which are secretly run by the MB leaders and seized documents, amounts of money and electronic devices that were in their possession, the statement added.

News article:
(MENAFN- The Peninsula) ANKARA: Six years ago, the Egyptian army's tanks gathered close to the well-known Al-Tahrir square announcing an end of the only one-year-long Egyptian democracy. However, this year's anniversary comes amid extreme grief filling the pro-uprising figures after their iconic leader Mohammed Morsi passed away during a court appearance. Following 18 days of unabated protests, Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for three decades, was eventually forced to step down and relinquish power to the Egyptian military. Morsi was elected as the first ever democratically elected president in the Egyptian history by winning the first post-revolution presidential election in 2012. In 2013, Morsi said the Egyptian uprising that broke out in Jan. 25, 2011 "achieved -- and will continue to achieve -- its goals. However, he went on to warn the public of covert attempts to "steal" the uprising and subvert its goals. Only after a year in power, Egypt witnessed army-backed protests before then Egyptian defense minister and current President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi overthrew him in a military coup. On June 30, 2013, tens of thousands of people -- egged on by the media -- took part in anti-Morsi demonstrations, while Morsi's followers hit the streets in support of the embattled president. Three days later, the army ousted and imprisoned Morsi in a coup led by al-Sisi. The following year, al-Sisi was elected president. Following Morsi's ouster, the Egyptian authorities launched a relentless crackdown on political dissent, killing or imprisoning thousands of Morsi's supporters and members of his now-banned Muslim Brotherhood. Dozens of youth were also slapped with death penalty for "politically-motivated" charges and violence took place after the coup. Fake and politically motivated charges Morsi was abducted and imprisoned, facing a host of charges many believed they were totally "fake and politically motivated." There were six charges against the former leader, including "jailbreak, murder, spying for Qatar, spying for Hamas and Hezbollah, insulting the judiciary and involvement in terrorism". Morsi's family along with local and international organizations repeatedly complained about his worsening health conditions in prison and his solitary confinement. All of these appeals were ignored by the Egyptian authorities. Abdel-Monem Abdel-Maqsoud, a lawyer for the former president, announced Morsi's death on June 17 during a court appearance, saying that the "mistreatment and the medical neglect" led to his martyrdom. Morsi was labelled by many observers and analysts as the "icon of the Egyptian revolution," after his steadfastness and insistence on the uprising principles against the "counter-revolution bids to thwart its goals". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Morsi "a martyr who died struggling for his cause", saying history will never forget the tyrants who caused his martyrdom. Shireen Mazari, Pakistan's minister for human rights, said: "Morsi's incarceration & amp; death symbolize the tragedy of democracy struggling under shadow of Uncle Sam. What promise the Arab Spring held & amp; how it was destroyed - is similar to what happened to Allende & amp; other democratic nationalist forces around the world inimical to the powerful!" Abderrazak Makri, the leader of Algeria's largest Islamic party Movement for the Society of Peace, described Morsi the "oppressed legitimate Egyptian president". Tunisia's Ennahda Movement wished that may Morsi's death becomes "a reason to put an end to the suffering of thousands of political prisoners in Egypt" and for starting dialogue for a new democratic political life. In Libya, Mohamed al-Amari, a member of the UN-recognized Libyan Presidential Council, described Morsi as a martyr, adding he had "set an example with his patience, steadfastness and adherence to his principles".

(MENAFN- Daily News Egypt) The Cairo Criminal Court held on Tuesday the first trial session of 14 defendants involved in the Ramses train crash, and postponed it to September 1. The crash left 31 dead and injured 17 others last February. The defendants are accused of negligence, not abiding by the operation manual, breaching safety rules, and forging the attendance sheet as the workers in charge of surveillance were absent. The prosecution called upon the judiciary panel while reciting the arraignment in the trial session to issue a ruling of the maximum penalty stated in the law. Head of the Central Administration for Planning and Maintenance, Saad Seoudi, told the prosecution that the trains contain safety systems that work in case of the fainting or death of the driver. He added that there were no notices or any defects in the train that slid. Seoudi clarified that it is the duty of the driver to check the operation and safety appliance of the train he is driving before departure to ensure there are no defects. The defendants include the drivers and drivers' assistants of the two trains involved in the crash, as well as a worker tasked with switching junctions and a manoeuvring operator on one of the trains. Prosecutors have ordered the driver who abandoned his vehicle to be drug tested. Former Transport Minister, Hesham Arafat, resigned as a result of the crash.

(MENAFN- The Peninsula) Jerusalem: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Israelis will take part in a conference in Bahrain next week that is part of the United States' Middle East peace plan. "An important conference will soon be held in Bahrain and Israelis will of course participate," Netanyahu said at an event in Tel Aviv. US President Donald Trump's administration organised the conference, which is to be held on June 25 and 26 in Manama, Bahrain for the unveiling of the economic component of the US peace plan. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has been drafting the long-awaited plan, but it has been rejected in advance by the Palestinians, who expect the proposals to heavily favour Israel. The plan is aimed at providing economic opportunities for the Palestinians, but Kushner has hinted it will not endorse international calls for the creation of a Palestinian state. "We welcome American attempts to provide regional solutions for a better future," Netanyahu said. Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on Monday that Israel would be represented at the conference, without giving further details. US allies the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have announced they will take part in the conference. The White House has also said that Egypt, Jordan and Morocco will attend, although these three countries have yet to confirm this. The Palestinian leadership has said it will boycott the US-led peace conference, and a number of prominent Palestinian businessmen have also rejected invites. The Palestinians have boycotted the US administration since Trump broke with decades of consensus and recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017. They consider the eastern part of the city the capital of their own future state. Media reports in Israel on Tuesday said the country would only be represented by private businessmen.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised the U.S.-sponsored conference on the Palestinian economy which will take place in Bahrain later this month, confirming Israeli participation in the event. The Israeli delegation will consist of private citizens involved in business, high-tech, and innovation, sources said, as well as Yoav Mordechai, a former Israeli general who served as chief liaison officer to the Palestinians. “A very important conference, which we welcome, will be held in Bahrain very soon – a U.S. effort to bring about a better future and solve the region’s problems,” Netanyahu said in a speech on Tuesday. “Israelis will be present, of course.” Netanyahu also charged that Israel had “contacts” with “most of the Arab countries,” adding that Israel maintains “secret contacts with many leaders of the Arab world and there are ramified contacts between the State of Israel and Arab countries, with most of the Arab countries.” Meanwhile, the Palestinian Authority (PA) continues to boycott all negotiations and insist they have successfully obstructed the June 25-26 workshop. “The American conspiracy has faltered, and its direction has changed,” PA Spokesman Nabil Abu Rudaineh asserted. “That’s because of Palestinian rejection and President Mahmoud Abbas’s clear position on Jerusalem, the refugees and the national principles.” Speaking in Ramallah last month, PA President Mahmoud Abbas said that, “The Palestinian Authority does not recognize this conference.” The PA chairman went on to describe the U.S. peace initiative as a “disgrace” and predicted that “the economic project they are working on for next month will also go to hell.” The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia announced in May that they would participate in the conference. Last week, Egypt, Jordan, and Morocco confirmed that they would also be sending delegation to Bahrain.

"We welcome American attempts to provide regional solutions for a better future," Netanyahu said. Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on Monday that Israel would be represented at the conference, without giving further details. US allies the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have announced they will take part in the conference. The White House has also said that Egypt, Jordan and Morocco will attend, although these three countries have yet to confirm this. The Palestinian leadership has said it will boycott the U.S.-led peace conference, and a number of prominent Palestinian businessmen have also rejected invites. The Palestinians have boycotted the US administration since Trump broke with decades of consensus and recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017. They consider the eastern part of the city the capital of their own future state. Media reports in Israel on Tuesday said the country would only be represented by private businessmen.

The United States is set to co-chair a two-day conference in Bahrain from Tuesday focusing on the economic aspects of President Donald Trump's Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.The workshop in Manama will bring together government, civil society and business leaders, according to a joint statement by the two organising countries, with the declared aim of achieving Palestinian prosperity.The Bahrain conference could see large-scale investment pledges for the Palestinian territories but is unlikely to focus heavily on the political issues at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The Palestinians confirmed in May they will not participate in the conference, adding they were not consulted beforehand."Palestine will not attend the Manama meeting," a statement on the Palestine Liberation Organisation's (PLO) website said."This is a collective Palestinian position, from President Mahmud Abbas and the PLO Executive Committee to all Palestinian political movements and factions, national figures, private sector and civil society."Abbas reiterated his position on Saturday as the US unveiled details of the plan, saying a political solution must come before any discussion of economic issues.The Palestinians have boycotted the US administration since Trump broke with decades of consensus and recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017.They consider the eastern part of the city the capital of their future state and have opposed the proposed US peace plan, which they fear will be heavily biased in favour of Israel.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israelis will attend."An important conference will soon be held in Bahrain and Israelis will of course participate," he said this week.However, it was unclear whether Israel would be represented by government officials or business leaders.Gulf powerhouses Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates last month welcomed the economic conference.Riyadh said it would dispatch Economy and Planning Minister Mohammed al-Tuwaijri to the meeting.It added the participation reaffirms the kingdom's "firm position to support the Palestinian people to achieve their stability and growth", according to the official Saudi Press Agency.Abu Dhabi's foreign ministry said it would send a delegation, while reiterating that it supports the establishment of a Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital.It remains unclear whether Qatar - isolated by regional former allies, including Bahrain, in a long-running diplomatic dispute - will attend the conference.Doha, a close US ally, said it "has followed the call by the United States" to hold a workshop in Manama, according to a foreign ministry statement.It added it will "spare no effort" to address challenges facing the Arab region but did not say whether Qatar will be represented at the meeting.Kuwait and Oman have not confirmed if they will attend.The White House said on June 12 that Egypt, Morocco and Jordan have agreed to attend the workshop.The three US allies "informed us that they will be attending the workshop," a senior White House official told AFP on condition of anonymity.Jordan and Egypt - the only Arab countries to have signed peace deals with Israel - finally confirmed their attendance on June 22.The treaty in Jordan, however, is overwhelmingly opposed by the people - more than half of whom are of Palestinian origin.The United Nations announced on June 12 that it would send its deputy Middle East coordinator Jamie McGoldrick to the event.

News article:
AMMAN: While Jordan witnessed a number of protest rallies in opposition to the Bahrain Prosperity to Peace workshop, political pundits were divided over their government’s decision on Saturday to participate with a low-level delegation headed by the director-general of the Ministry of Finance. Adnan Abu Odeh, a former adviser to King Hussein and King Abdullah, told Arab News that attending the workshop was important to learn what it was about. “If Jordan is supposed to be included in this plan, it makes sense for Jordanians to understand it better before making any decision,” he said. Abu Odeh said that participation in the June 25 workshop in the Bahraini capital Manama did not mean acceptance or rejection of it. “At present we were invited to learn about it and not to make a decision whether to accept it or not.” Ahmad Shunaq, secretary-general of the National Constitutional Party, said that participation did not mean the surrender of steadfast positions on the Palestinian issue. “We are with Jordan and against any attempts at doubting our intentions. If we are absent, we will allow others to negotiate on our behalf. The ABC of international politics is always to protect the policies of the homeland.” The Islah block in Jordan’s Parliament, however, issued a strong statement opposing participation. Coalition head, Abdallah Akileh, said in a statement that Jordan should not attend. “We call on the government not to attend the Bahrain workshop, which is the beginning of a plan to liquidate the Palestinian cause at the expense of Jordan.” Akileh noted that even if Jordanian representation was very low at the level of the director-general of the Finance Ministry, such participation legitimized “the conspiracy against us and our sovereignty.” Veteran journalist and analyst, Lamis Andoni, commented on her Facebook page that the economic workshop is nothing more than a trap. “Economic contracts require that the economic plan is also accepted and that the Palestinian markets are open for foreign investments who will be the big winners in this effort.” Labor rights activist, Mohammad Snaid, also denounced the workshop and Jordan’s participation in it. “Our position on the Manama conference is the total rejection of it. This even is aimed at conspiring against the Palestinian cause and Jordan at the same time.” Snaid said: “The US will be led to believe that Jordan’s participation means acceptance of the deal of the century, which the people of Jordan reject since we stand side by side with our Palestinian brothers and we will not accept anything that Palestinians will not accept in support of their inalienable rights.” MP Mohammad Tharawi said that Jordan is experiencing a pivotal moment and must take its responsibility seriously. “The rights of millions of Jordanians of Palestinian origin in historic Palestine is on our shoulders, they have the right of return and compensation,” he said.

(MENAFN- Kuwait News Agency (KUNA)) AMMAN, June 22 (KUNA) -- Jordan will participate in the Bahrain workshop, which the US called for as part of a peace plan to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, known as the century deal, The Jordanian government announced Saturday. Jordan decided to participate in the economic workshop called by the US and Bahrain in Manama on 25 and 26 of June at the level of secretary general of the ministry of finance to listen to what will be presented, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sufyan Al-Qudhat said in a press statement. The spokesperson reaffirmed his country's position that there is no alternative to the two-state solution that guarantees all the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, foremost of which is their right to freedom in accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab peace initiative. According to the statement, Jordan will deal with any economic or political approach according to its positions, and it rejects any proposal that does not conform to its principles and it will continue to work and communicate with the international community, and devote all its relations and resources to rallying support for its positions and supporting the Palestinian right.

Jordan and Egypt have said they will send officials from their finance ministries to take part in an economic conference in Bahrain on a U.S.-led Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. Egypt's foreign ministry spokesman Ahmed Hafez told AFP that Cairo will send a delegation headed by a deputy finance minister to the meeting - due to take place in Manama on June 25 and 26 - without specifying the name. In Jordan, foreign ministry spokesman Sufyan al-Qudah confirmed to journalists that his country will dispatch the secretary general to the finance ministry, again without giving a name. Qudah insisted however that "no economic proposal could replace a political solution that ends the occupation" of Palestinian territories by Israel. The White House said on June 12 that Egypt, Morocco and Jordan have agreed to attend the workshop. But Jordan and Egypt -- the only Arab countries to have signed peace deals with Israel -- did not immediately confirm they would take part in the Bahrain meeting. Morocco has not yet confirmed its intentions. The Palestinian Authority is boycotting the two-day conference -- dubbed the Peace to Prosperity Workshop -- charging that pro-Israel U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to buy the Palestinians and deprive them of an independent state. The U.S. said Saturday that its Middle East peace plan aims to raise more than $50 billion (44 billion euros) for the Palestinians and create one million jobs for them. In a move likely to deepen its rift with the Palestinians, the White House said that money would be administered by a multinational development bank -- not the Palestinian Authority -- as a way to ensure better governance and prevent corruption.

News article:
(MENAFN- Kuwait News Agency (KUNA)) By Rola Al-Riyashi WASHINGTON, June 24 (KUNA) -- Bahrain will host on Tuesday (tomorrow) an economic workshop entitled "from peace to prosperity" to discuss economic prospects of Palestinian people and the region's nations that could lead to a peace between the Palestinian and Israeli sides. However, Palestine announced its boycott of the workshop, which will only include some Israeli businesspersons. The economic part of the US peace plan known as "the deal of the century" is expected to announce during the workshop that aims to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Last May, Bahrain and the United States announced in a joint statement that Manama would host the two-day workshop, on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to the statement, the workshop constitutes a pivotal chance to bring together leaders of governments and civil society, and businesspersons in order to share ideas and discuss strategies as well as mobilize support for possible economic initiatives and investments that could be achieved through a peace deal. Both Bahrain and the US considered that the workshop aims to facilitate talks on an applicable vision and a framework for a prosperous future for Palestinian people and the region's nations, including improving economic governance, developing human capital and facilitating rapid growth of the private sector. If this vision is achieved, it will change radically lives of peoples and make a brighter future for the region. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that he is looking forward to "these important talks" regarding providing new and exciting chances to Palestinian people that could enable them to achieve at the maximum level. The workshop gathers leaders from the Middle East region to enhance economic growth and create opportunities for peoples in this key region, he added. Meanwhile, Bahrain's Minister of Finance and National Economy Sheikh Salman Bin Khalifa Al-Khalifa said that the workshop would shed light on the strategic partnership between the United States and Bahrain, and their keenness on creating economic chances to benefit the region. However, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, Palestinian Authority's spokesman, said on June 18 that "any meeting, whether in Bahrain or elsewhere and without the legitimate Palestinian endorsement, proves that Washington cannot and will not succeed on its own in achieving anything". In reply to Abu Rudeineh's statement, President Donald Trump's Special Representative for International Negotiations Jason Greenblatt wrote on his Twitter account that Abu Rudeineh misunderstood the US stance, adding Washington understands that a peace deal will not be achieved without the Palestinian leadership. However, if a peace deal is not be achieved, it will be a loss to the Palestinians not to the Americans, he noted. "The PA (Palestinian Authority) is asking for more money from the Arab countries, but they won't come to a workshop which is designed to improve their economy & taper off endless aid. I think we all have to recognize that the endless aid (& rewarding terrorists) has to end. Time for a new paradigm," he tweeted. "The PA is calling for demonstrations against the Bahrain workshop. Tells you everything you need to know about their priorities & intentions. Their leadership is happy w/ the status quo & would rather Palestinians suffer than at least explore a different path for a better future," he wrote. The Palestinian side announced its boycott of the workshop, stressing its firm demand on finding a political solution to the Palestinian cause through ending the Israeli occupation, and establishing an independent state on 1967 borders and in accordance with the international legitimacy's resolutions.(end) rsr.hm MENAFN2406201900710000ID1098677136

News article:
WASHINGTON (JTA) — Jason Greenblatt, President Donald Trump’s top Middle East negotiator, led Jewish prayer services at a synagogue in Bahrain this week during the conference there that rolled out the economic portion of the Trump administration’s peace plan. Greenblatt mustered an Orthodox minyan — a quorum of ten adult Jewish males — for morning services Wednesday at the synagogue, which dates to the 19th century. Participants were among the businessmen, officials, journalists and think-tank employees attending the conference. Houda Nonoo, the former Bahraini ambassador to the United States and a member of the country’s Jewish community of 35 or so people, said minyans were rare in the synagogue, tending to take place more at cemeteries and in people’s homes. “It was an amazing experience to see everybody here together,” she told i24, an Israel-based news channel. She could not remember the last time the synagogue had shacharit, or the morning prayer service. Greenblatt posted a picture of the service on Twitter. “A special opportunity to daven (pray) this morning with a minyan (quorum) in a synagogue in Bahrain,” he said. “Great way to start today. I was asked what I prayed for — two things: my family, who I miss deeply and of course for peace. This is an example of the future we can all build together.” The conference wrapped up on its second day without news of whether Jared Kushner, the peace team’s boss and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, had extracted the $50-70 billion in pledges he is seeking to seed the infrastructural changes he says the Palestinian economy needs as a predicate for peace. The Palestinian Authority is boycotting the conference, in part because Trump has favored Israel by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and because Trump and Congress have cut off all U.S. funding to the Palestinians. “The overall consensus is that this is a very executable plan if we’re able to get a political solution and if we have the right governing structure in place,” Kushner said in a video recapping the conference that the White House posted on Twitter. The same day the conference opened, on Tuesday, officials of the United Nations Work and Relief Agency, which administers aid to Palestinian refugees and their descendants, garnered $113 million in pledges to help make up for the $360 million the Trump administration had cut in funding for the agency. “I think the situation is extremely precarious when you think of a million people not receiving food assistance in Gaza,” UNRWA chief Pierre Krahenbuhl told the Associated Press. The Bahrain conference, while inconclusive in its immediate goals — Kushner says he will roll out the political component of his plan later this year — was yet another signal of growing acceptance of Israel in the Arab world. Bahrain for the first time allowed Israeli journalists to enter to cover the conference. Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, the Bahraini foreign minister, said that Israel was now a given in the region. “Israel is part of this heritage of this whole region, historically,” the foreign minister said. “The Jewish people have a place amongst us.”

News article:
MANAMA: Jared Kushner’s “workshop” aimed at securing economic prosperity for Palestine closed with optimistic forecasts from President Donald Trump’s special adviser that it could be the basis for a forthcoming political deal with Israel. Kushner told journalists at a post-event briefing: “I think that people are all leaving very energized, very pleasantly surprised at how many like-minded people they see. It is a solvable problem economically, and the reason why we thought it was important to lay out the economic vision before we lay out the political vision is because we feel we need people to see what the future can look like. “The Palestinian people have been promised a lot of things over the years that have not come true. We want to show them that this is the plan, this is what can happen if there is a peace deal.” The next stage, before a political deal is attempted, will be to get feedback from the event and agree to commitments for the $50 billion package for Palestine and other regional economies. “I think you need $50 billion to really do this the right way, to get a paradigm shift,” Kushner added. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said: “I could not be happier how this has gone,” adding that he was “highly confident we will soon have the first $4 billion. It’s going to be like a hot initial public offering.” Most of the attendees at the event in Manama, Bahrain, gave Kushner’s economic proposals a serious hearing and agreed it was a useful exercise. Mohammed Al-Shaikh, Saudi minister of state, said: “Can it be done? Yes it can, because it was done before. In the mid-1990s to about the year 2000 there was a global coordinated effort by the US and other countries. I was at the World Bank at the time. I saw it. If we could do it then with significantly less money we can do it again.” Others warned, however, that there was still a long way to go on the political aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian relationship. Tony Blair, the former British prime minister and Middle East peace envoy, said a political deal was essential. “This is an economic plan that, if it is implemented, is going to do enormous good for the Palestinian people. But it isn’t a substitute for the politics. There will be no economic peace. There will be a peace that will be a political component and an economic component. The economy can help the politics and the politics is necessary for the economy to flourish. “The politics has got to be right in this sense as well. The obvious sense people talk about is how do you negotiate the contours of the boundaries of a Palestinian state in a two state solution,” Blair said. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, highlighted the work the fund has done in conflict situations. “We had an exceptional result in Rwanda, and a good economic outcome in Mozambique,” she said. But she contrasted this with disappointing results in other African conflicts. Lagarde said that the aim of the economic plan should be to create jobs. “The focus should be on job-intensive industries, like agriculture, tourism and infrastructure.” Willem Buiter, special economic adviser to US banking giant Citi, said there were obstacles to the Kushner plan succeeding. “Necessary conditions for any progress are peace, safety and security. And there must be high-quality governance and the rule of law in Palestine,” he said. HIGHLIGHTS • Jared Kushner believes the conflict is a ‘solvable problem economically.’ • The senior adviser vows to lay out political plans at the right time. • Expert urges external funding in the form of grants or equity, rather than loans. He also suggested external funding should be in the form of grants or equity, rather than loans. “We should not burden a country trying to escape from its past with high debts,” he added. Some attendees warned of the risks to investor funds in the current political situation in the Middle East. But Khalid Al-Rumaihi, chief executive of the Bahrain Economic Development Board, said: “Risk is not new to the region. We’ve tackled it for the past 30 to 40 years, but that has not stopped investment flowing in. “Investors trade risk for return, and the Middle East has learned to cope with risk and conflict. There are pockets where the risk is high and Palestine is one of them. But I remain positive. The return in the region is higher to compensate for the risk,” he added. At a session of regional finance ministers, Mohammed Al-Jadaan of Saudi Arabia said: “The region is in desperate need of prosperity and hope. There is a way forward, but you need political commitment.” UAE Finance Minister Obaid Al-Tayer added: “We are decoupling politics from economics. If it’s the only initiative on the table we should all give it a chance.”

News article:
Oman's foreign ministry announced it will open an embassy on the West Bank on Wednesday. The diplomatic mission will be located in the West Bank city of Ramallah. "The Sultanate [of Oman], which continues its support of the brotherly Palestinian people, has approved to open a new Omani diplomatic delegation at the level of an embassy in Palestine," Oman's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a tweet. "A delegation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will travel to Ramallah to start with the opening procedures." The step coincides with the US-led economic workshop in Bahrain to unveil a Middle East peace plan, which is not expected to recognise an independent Palestinian state. The UAE, Jordan and Morocco all have diplomatic missions in Ramallah. Last year, the US downgraded its mission to Palestine, merging it with their embassy to Israel, which they moved to Jerusalem. In Bahrain, Jared Kushner, an adviser to President Donald Trump, has been selling his plan for Middle East peace that seeks US$50 billion (Dh184bn) in investment in the form of more than 150 projects. It has been criticised for failing to tackle tough political and statehood issues.

News article:
Oman announced today that it will open an embassy in the occupied West Bank. In a tweet, Oman's Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote: "In continuation of the Sultanate's support for the Palestinian people, the Sultanate has decided to open a new diplomatic mission to the State of Palestine at the level of an embassy." استمرارا لنهج #السلطنة الداعم للشعب الفلسطيني الشقيق، قررت السلطنة فتح بعثة دبلوماسية جديدة لها لدى دولة #فلسطين على مستوى سفارة.وسيتوجه وفد من وزارة الخارجية الى رام الله لمباشرة إجراءات فتح السفارة. — وزارة الخارجية (@MofaOman) June 26, 2019 The ministry also said that a delegation "will travel to Ramallah to initiate the opening of the embassy," without providing further details or a timescale. The announcement comes against the backdrop of today's "Peace to Prosperity" conference in Bahraini capital Manama, during which the economic aspects of the long-awaited "deal of the century" are being discussed. The majority of Gulf states are attending the conference, despite the Palestinian factions' appeal for Arab countries to boycott the summit in protest at the plan's contents. Islamic Jihad: PA's absence snubbs Bahrain conference, its organisers Oman has come under scrutiny recently for normalising relations with Israel, with which it does not hold formal diplomatic ties. In a landmark visit, Oman's Sultan Qaboos Bin Said in December received Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the Sultanate. Netanyahu subsequently boasted that, during the meeting, Bin Said had granted permission for Israel's flag carrier airline El Al to fly over Omani airspace. "Therefore, only one small thing remains for us to do," Netanyahu told journalists as he pointed to Saudi Arabia on a map. Without similar permission from the Saudis, Muscat's promise was seen as worthless, as the Sultanate borders states with no diplomatic ties to Israel. Oman's Foreign Minister has since tried to downplay his country's relations with Israel, in February reiterating the Sultanate's commitment to the two-state solution and "a peaceful process to find a settlement for the Palestinian cause that guarantees their rights and the interests of all".
