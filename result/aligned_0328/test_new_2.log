News article:
Flaming kites and balloons launched from the Gaza Strip sparked four fires in southern Israel Wednesday. Though firefighters had the four blazes under control, a number of additional fires broke out near the Kissufim Forest, Channel 10 reported. The network said firefighters were at the scene combating the blazes. There were no reports of injuries, but the fires have caused extensive damage in recent weeks. Overnight, the Israeli military carried out a number of strikes in the Gaza Strip in response to the launching of incendiary balloons from the Palestinian enclave toward Israel on Tuesday, which sparked a number of fires. One of the strikes targeted a car that the army said belonged to a senior Hamas operative involved in the airborne arson attacks. The army said it also used an additional aircraft and a tank to strike two Hamas outposts in the north of the Strip.

There were no casualties reported, indicating the car was empty at the time. Terror groups in Gaza launched over a dozen rockets toward Israel in retaliation for the strikes, setting off warning sirens and sending thousands of Israelis to bomb shelters. At least three rockets were intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system. There were no reports of casualties or damage in Israel. In addition, no rocket impacts were reported inside Israeli communities. Advertisement The Israel Defense Forces issued a warning to Hamas after the rocket attacks, saying the group “would pay the price for the terror and the instability.” In recent weeks, the military has adopted a policy of targeting Hamas positions in response to repeated incendiary kite and balloon attacks from Gaza in an effort to force the group, which rules the coastal enclave, to stop launching the arson devices and to force others in the Strip to abandon the tactic as well. However, Hamas is attempting to maintain that the near-constant airborne arson attacks, which have burned thousands of acres of Israeli land, do not warrant retaliatory strikes by Israel and therefore accuses Jerusalem of violating the tacit ceasefire between the two sides. “Bombings will be answered with bombings,” Hamas said after its rocket attacks on Wednesday. It was the third such exchange between Israel and Hamas in recent weeks. On June 18 and 20, Hamas and its ally the Iran-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad launched similar rocket and mortar attacks at southern Israel after the IDF conducted airstrikes against Hamas positions in response to repeated arson attacks. The Israeli military has carried out multiple warning strikes in recent weeks at groups of Gazans preparing to launch incendiary devices toward Israel. The army has said repeatedly that it will act to prevent the launch of the airborne incendiary devices and explosives. Advertisement Since March 30, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have launched countless kites, balloons and inflated latex condoms bearing flammable materials, and occasionally explosives, into Israeli territory, sparking near-daily fires that have burned thousands of acres of farmland, parks and forests. Israeli leaders have warned that the military is prepared to take more intense offensive action against the phenomenon. Israeli leaders have been split on how to respond to those responsible for the airborne arson attacks, with some calling for the IDF to shoot the kite flyers and balloon launchers on sight, while others argue that it would be a step too far.

Firefighters battled to fight five blazes sparked by incendiary devices flown toward Israeli communities from Gaza on Saturday. Economy and Industry Minister Eli Cohen said Saturday that those who launch the kites from Gaza should be targeted, as the safety of Israelis living in the vicinity of the coastal enclave must be the first priority. “These kites are not toys, but weapons aimed at hurting us, just like Kassam rockets and Molotov cocktails,” Cohen told the Shabbat b’Tarbut cultural event in Holon.

This Saturday will mark 100 days since the beginning of the phenomenon of incendiary kites and balloons being launched into Israeli communites bordering the Gaza Strip, with parents complaining of the accompanying difficulties in raising their chidlren under the constant specter of fires and rocket attacks. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter When the first incendiary kite landed in a Gaza border community on March 30, few imagined that it would turn into a such a regular occurrence that would see dozens of fires break out on a daily basis and ravage swathes of Israeli landscape. Every day the flames devour more and more locations, thousands of acres of forests, agricultural land and fields The local residents, who already live under a constant threat of rocket fire from the Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror groups, now have to fear suspicious balloons in the sky or kites flying from across the border. One senior security source said that what began as a gimmick during protests on the Gaza border, has grown into a serious threat that is making life increasingly difficult for local residents, and adds a new threat for which the people there need to prepare their kids. It might also lead to another escalation of violence in the south, several officials have warned. The reality of rocket fire and Code Red alerts is part of everyday life for the residents of Gaza border communities. Those who were still children when rocket fire began in 2001, are now parents who have to teach their children not only about the danger of missiles but about incendiary balloons as well. "In your development as a parent in the Gaza border region, you cannot hide the reality of the situation anymore,” said Michal Gal-Burgan, a mother of two, from the Eshkol Regional Council. “Our children ask us questions ‘Why are they not nice to us?’. We tell them the truth and don’t sugarcoat and we tell them about the balloons and kites as well. We simply tell them not to touch. There is a feeling of desperation and exhaustion,” added Gal-Burgan. She also discussed daily life in the region since the end of Operation Protective Edge in 2014. “It’s been four years since Protective Edge, and until recently it was calm and we could live a normal life, but right now the situation is tense once again. It’s tiring. I had hoped that when I became a parent, my children wouldn’t have to deal with the same issues. I thought the government would find a solution so we could live in peace, but in reality, everyday we give up part of our peace of mind,” she concluded. Local children also spoke about their experiences, exlpaining how they deal with the dangerous phenomenon. "Counselors showed us a picture of a kite and a balloon," said 8-year-old Elia Gal who attends a children's home for at-risk kids. "The balloon in the picture had a sponge with matches attached to it. The counselors told us that if we find something similar then we should stay away from it and call for help." Avi Dabush, Dana Kalfa with the girls Hila and Amit, Michal and Nimrod Gal-Burgan with the children Elia and Ariel and Aharon (Photo: Haim Horenstein) Aaron Ariel Lavie, a father of four and a resident of Shuva, a religious moshav in southern Israel where over the past months dozens of incendiary balloons have landed, says that he and his family are very strong. However, he calls on the government to urgently formulate a policy to resolve the issue. “I am not of those who complains ... but unfortunately there’s no policy on what happens in the Gaza Strip. If there is no diplomatic solution, there’s no point entering another war. It’s hard to see our land being burned. I am a person that loves nature and it is painful to watch it get destroyed. It will only intensify. We shouldn't accept this threat,” vented the father. Ofir Kalfa, a father of two, and a Sderot native who currently lives in Kibbutz Gevim in the Gaza border region, explained the difficulties he is experiencing in raising children in such an environment. “Our children are heroes. The suffering they’ve experienced over the past few months has reached new heights. Our responsibility, as adults, is to fix the situation. The Netanyahu government is far from doing that,” Kalfa complained. Another father of two, Avi Dabush from Sderot who serves as the Head of the Meretz party in the periphery, called on the country to invest more in the region. “Seventeen years of war and 100 days of incendiary kites, and the Israeli government keeps putting out fires. The position of the leadership is to formulate a strategy and to promote prosperity in Sderot and Gaza border communities. This is what the brave residents and children here deserve,” exclaimed Dabush.

Nine firefighting teams and four firefighting aircraft fought a blaze outside Kibbutz Or HaNer in southern Israel. Incendiary kites also ignited a fire near Kibbutz Nir Am. A post on the Facebook page of Reshet 13 Hebrew news showed the damage caused by the incendiary kites. The incendiary kites and helium balloons are part of the ongoing Hamas-led March of Return protests and thousands have been sent over the border into Israel. On Friday evening, a group of Gazans approached the security fence separating Israel from Gaza when an explosive one was carrying went off, killing the 22-year-old man. In contrast to the Gazan violence, approximately four-thousand Israelis took part in a protest on Friday on the border with Gaza, waving Israeli flags and flying blue kites in response to the Gazan incendiary kites. The demonstrators also called on the Israeli government to recover the bodies of Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin, IDF soldiers who were killed in Gaza during the 2014 war. Hamas refuses to return their remains.

News article:
Israeli diplomats have responded with shock to secret details of the Iran deal revealed in the Senate hearing of US Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday, in which classified sections of the deal not originally released were unearthed. One particularly troubling detail that was divulged is that the covert military base Parchin, which Iran has admitted to using to test exploding bridge wire nuclear detonators, will be off limits to international inspectors, exactly as Iran has threatened. Instead Iran will take its own samples from Parchin and do its own testing of the covert site. Kerry responded in the hearing by saying the agreements on Parchin are part of the classified section of the deal, and that he trusts the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) when it says it is satisfied with them; ironically, the IAEA has in numerous reports warned that Iran is conducting nuclear weapons testing at the site, and requested numerous times to inspect the site - requests that Iran rejected. Responding to the revelation, a senior Israeli diplomatic source was cited by Yedioth Aharonoth saying, "not only did the Iranians receive a warning time of 24 days (before inspection) to clean things up, apparently they don't even need to worry because they're the ones collecting the samples." "That means it just allows the Iranians to fabricate the samples and there is no chance that breaches (of the deal) will be found. It means there won't be real inspection." A senior minister of the Israeli government who is also a member of the Security Cabinet was likewise quoted on condition of anonymity in the report responding to the self-testing issue. "In this deal and its annexes there are lots of astonishing things, like the fact that Iran is the one to collect the samples from nuclear sites, and that the world powers obligated to help Iran prevent sabotage at nuclear facilities," said the minister. He added, "each day it becomes clear how awful this deal is. This deal is full of holes. Everyone understands that they (the Iranians) tricked them. The more we go deeper into deals and annexes we discover that the Americans and the international community crossed many red lines." Heightening the concern over Parchin, satellite photos have shown Iran has been modifying the site, possibly expanding the nuclear tests and covering up their existence. Given that international inspectors will not be allowed in the site, Iran would apparently be allowed to ramp up its covert nuclear weapons program unfettered. Reports tied the Parchin base to Iran's nuclear program following a mysterious explosion at the site last October. IAEA reports in November 2011 pointed to nuclear weapons development previously conducted at the site, and a 2012 IAEA report likewise confirmed explosives containment vessels were at the site and likely used to test nuclear detonators.

News article:
Several very disturbing aspects about the Iran nuclear deal have come to light which require clear thinking and firm action by all P5+1 parties to the agreement. For example it is impossible to reconcile assurances of 24/7 surveillance with the subsequently disclosed provision of 24 days’ notice being required before IAEA will be given access to suspicious sites. It does not require any stretch of imagination to foresee that this period can be used to remove evidence and that it could be extended by spurious arguments about special circumstances or inaccessibility. After all President Obama emphasized in his press conference that Iran cannot be trusted Annex One, Section Q of the agreement requires that IAEA inspectors will first have to ask Iran’s permission to visit a suspicious location: “The IAEA will provide Iran the reasons for access in writing and will make available relevant information.” After that, Iran has the chance to propose “alternative means” to address IAEA suspicions. All of that will stretch the period. According to the Wall Street Journal, Charles Duelfer, former Iraq weapons inspector, told the paper that there is a lot the regime can do to hide material in a few hours, let alone days, allowing room for Iran to maneuver and potentially hide much of what it is doing regarding weapons design or component testing. Side deals and additional causes for concern As Secretary Perry has declared he is not aware of the recently disclosed secret side deals to the Iran nuclear agreement concluded between the IAEA and Iran, one must conclude that the negotiators for the other P5+1 countries are equally uninformed about some critical details relating to the agreement they concluded with Iran. In the circumstances one expects all the P5+1 countries to examine every explicit and implicit detail of this historic agreement and to take care to remove all ambiguities that may lead to future disputes about the true meaning and intent of each clause. After all, rational and responsible behavior require nothing less. According to US Senator Tom Cotton and Congressmen Mike Pompeo they were told that the secret side deals will not be shared with other nations, with Congress, nor with the U.S. public. One of these side deals concerns inspection of the Parchin military base which the IAEA has not been allowed to visit and where it is believed Iran has conducted nuclear-warhead tests.. The other concerns how the IAEA and Iran will resolve outstanding issues on possible military dimensions (PMDs) of Iran’s past nuclear program which Iran has consistently refused to divulge over the years Advertisement In a July 15 Wall Street Journal op-ed Former Department of Energy official William Tobey explained that for inspections to be meaningful, Iran would have to completely and correctly declare all its relevant nuclear activities and procurement, past and present. Apart from being denied access to the secret agreements, the P5+1 countries should be even more concerned that they will not be able to determine whether or not Iran will have complied with them. Evidently Secretary Kerry’s assurances, expressed in the video clip below, that all the information would be received from Iran are far from having been realized. Troubling too, is the revelation that US inspectors have been banned from the IAEA surveillance team although some claim that they are among the most qualified for the task. Advertisement And most incredible of the questions about the nuclear agreement is the suggestion that that the IAEA will not be allowed to collect samples from suspected sites but will have to rely on samples collected and submitted by the Iranians. This would be a “dangerous farce,” according to former CIA intelligence analyst Fred Fleitz in National Review Online. His warning followed an exchange at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, in which John Kerry would not definitively deny a claim by Sen. James Risch that Iran will be responsible for gathering samples from the military base Parchin. Sen. Bob Menendez asked Kerry, “Is it true that the Iranians are going to be able to take the sample, as Senator Risch said? Kerry responded, “As you know, that is a classified component of this. It’s supposed to be discussed on a classified setting… I’m not confirming how it’s happening…I’m saying that we are confident that the IAEA jas the ability to get the answers that they need.” Most disturbing of all, are suggestions from reliable sources that other secret deals probably exist in addition to the two that have been disclosed serendipitously and, as mentioned above, the parliaments of all P5 countries as well as members of the EU need to study the materially very carefully in their own interests bearing in mind their responsibility to future generations.

News article:
As the world’s largest kosher food certification agency, we at the Orthodox Union know a few things about inspection programs. Our “OU” logo is on nearly one million food products made in over ninety countries, and some age old Jewish rules about kosher supervision are relevant to the current debate over the proposed Iran Nuclear Deal. Earlier this year, President Obama said the negotiations with Iran were premised on the notion that we shouldn’t trust Iran and that a deal must provide “vigorous, unprecedented inspections so we know at every point along their nuclear chain exactly what they’re doing…for twenty years…and…even if they wanted to cheat…we would have insights into their program we’ve never had before.” In April, Secretary of Energy Moniz, one of the Deal’s lead negotiators, told Bloomberg News that to assure of this “we expect to have anytime, anywhere access” to sites where Iran might conduct nuclear program activities. Now that the Deal has been concluded, we see that its inspection regime falls short of the benchmarks previously stated by the President and his team. While IAEA inspectors will have access to known nuclear sites in Iran, they must request access to Iranian military or other suspected sites, and Iran can delay such access for at least 24 days — leaving plenty of space for cheating and time for it to be concealed once suspected. Here is where the lessons from kosher laws are instructive. There are clear requirements for providing inspection and certification for a kosher food producer. In the case of a restaurant, where there’s concern that in the frenetic activity of a kitchen mistakes can, and will, happen, a certifying rabbi must be on site constantly; whenever the kitchen is operating the rabbi is there. In the case of a food production factory, where systems and ingredients are more fixed, a certifying rabbi must be able to come and inspect unannounced, whenever he wishes. These modes of inspection are required even when the cooks and owners are trustworthy. In the case of a food producer owned by someone untrustworthy, the certifying rabbi must also have a set of keys to the restaurant or factory. Only these modes of inspection and certification are sufficient to earn a kosher seal of approval. Critically, if a food producer — whether it’s a small corner café or huge Nabisco factory — refuses to accept such inspection rules or violates them, the OU will withhold or rescind its kosher certification and the producer will face the consequences in the marketplace. The OU will not water down its standards to assuage the food producer — he must meet our standards. President Obama and other world leaders acknowledge the Iranian regime has a record of unscrupulousness. The President has asserted that the Deal’s inspection regime is sufficient because Uranium and other nuclear materials have a half-life of eons and can be detected with sophisticated sensors even if removed. But this argument assumes all work related to a nuclear weapons program involves nuclear materials, which it does not, and that Iran will not be able to hide such work in locations that elude suspicion entirely, which they can — they’ve done it before. Thus, there is no question the inspection program in the pending deal falls short. An inspection program that does not allow inspectors to deploy anywhere in Iran with the ability to inspect suspect facilities in the country in real time is clearly insufficient. If Iran indeed intended full compliance with the agreement, and does not plan to pursue a nuclear weapon surreptitiously, they would have nothing to hide and no reason to object to such pervasive inspections. The Obama Administration and its five negotiating partners should have rejected the agreement on this basis alone — and the U.S. Congress should vote to disapprove the Deal on this basis in the next 60 days. Without a truly robust regime of inspection, there’s no doubt the proposed Deal with Iran is not kosher.

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, July 29 By Fatih Karimov - Trend: A senior nuclear expert believes that the verification of Iran N-program depends on a secret agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency and this country's full cooperation with the UN body. Secretary of State John Kerry insisted on July 28 the Barak Obama administration has not seen the contents of two side agreements to the Iran nuclear deal reached between that country and the IAEA. Besides an agreement between Iran and P5+1 and signing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran also signed an bilateral agreement with the IAEA to solve remaining disputes and answer the UN body's questions in coming weeks. While ignoring the objections of both Iran and U.S. lawmakers, the implementation of nuclear agreement depends on verification of Iran's nuclear program by the IAEA. Tehran says the removal of sanctions based on nuclear agreement could start in four to six months. Iran has also asked the IAEA to keep the mutual agreement hidden. Responding to a question about "how long a time is needed for the IAEA to prove Iran's nuclear activities have been totally peaceful and does the measures, mentioned in the nuclear agreement guarantee this program would remain peaceful?", Toby Dalton, Co-Director, Nuclear Policy Program at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace told Trend on July 29 that "first, how long it will take the IAEA to be able to say that Iran's program is totally peaceful will depend very heavily on how much Iran cooperates in the investigation of past activities. It could be five years, 10 years, or never - it is impossible to say at this point I think until we know more about the cooperation given by Iran to the IAEA, although the agreement does stipulate that the IAEA should be able to say in eight years that Iran's program is peaceful". Iran has agreed to put restrictions in some nuclear activities from eight to 15 years. The nuclear expert added that "second, the point that is not acknowledged by critics of the deal is that without these provisions in place through the deal, there would be no process for the IAEA to determine whether the program is peaceful or not. So compared to what existed before the deal, there is a much better chance the IAEA can carry out a thorough investigation that will reach conclusion". "Third, there is no guarantee, either under the deal or not under the deal and regardless of the verification provisions in place, that Iran's nuclear program will remain peaceful. That is up to Iran. The deal certainly creates incentives and disincentives for Iran that should limit its desire to build nuclear weapons, and my view is that the deal is more likely to ensure that Iran's program is focused on nuclear energy than nuclear weapons than would a simple continuation of the sanctions regime in place," he said. The U.S. Republicans argue that the achieved JCPOA is not enough to ensure Iran's nuclear program would remain peaceful, while Iranian hardliners says the agreement has damaged Iran's rights.

News article:
A U.S. think tank said Iran might be cleaning up its Parchin military site, where some countries suspect experiments may have taken place in a possible atomic weapons program, but Iran denied this on Thursday. The U.S.-based Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) pointed to satellite images showing vehicles and container-like objects being moved at Parchin. Iran said this was part of road works in the area. ISIS said the images were taken after Iran signed a major deal with world powers to curb its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Such activity might complicate the work of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), whose job it is to judge whether Iran's past atomic activity had any military dimensions, including through access to Parchin. "This renewed activity occurring after the signing of the (July 14 deal) raises obvious concerns that Iran is conducting further sanitization efforts to defeat IAEA verification," the Washington-based think tank said in a report. "This renewed activity may be a last ditch effort to try to ensure that no incriminating evidence will be found," said ISIS, which was founded by a former IAEA nuclear inspector to bring scientific expertise to debates about nuclear weapons. Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York issued a statement saying it "strongly denies and rejects the baseless claims about the so-called cleanup operations in the Parchin Military Complex". It said there was construction work at Parchin to repair a road and denounced "the extensive vicious campaign at work ... to poison the positive environment at the global level." "The Islamic Republic of Iran... has never had any military nuclear activity and has never been engaged in any unconventional act that would need a hasty cover-up," it added. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters on Thursday he could not confirm the group's findings but that any cleanup effort would be "cause for concern." He said the United States is confident it knows what has occurred at Parchin as well as its ability to detect previous nuclear activity at any Iranian site. "You can't cover up past nuclear activity very easily. It lasts for decades, even longer," Toner said. White House spokesman Josh Earnest separately played down any such Iranian efforts, although he said at a daily briefing he could not discuss any specific intelligence matters. 'No tolerance' Former IAEA Deputy Director General Olli Heinonen, currently at Harvard University, said there could be multiple reasons for the activity at Parchin, including sanitation or even a desire to test the limits of the nuclear deal. "If this, after the requests of the IAEA to access (the site), ... goes without a contest a precedent has been created," he said. "There should be no tolerance to any possible alterations of a site after access has been requested by the IAEA." According to data given to the IAEA by some member states, Parchin might have housed hydrodynamic experiments to assess how specific materials react under high pressure, such as in a nuclear blast. A diplomat familiar with the Iran file said that the images showed the difficulty of implementing the July deal. "Old habits die hard," he said, referring to Iran, which in the past had failed to declare some of its nuclear activities to the IAEA. The Vienna-based agency, which had no immediate comment on the ISIS report, said in its latest extensive Iran report that it continued to observe vehicles and construction material at Parchin and that activities there since 2012 are likely to have undermined its ability to conduct verification. As a precondition to full sanctions relief, Tehran must provide sufficient information to the IAEA by Oct. 15 to allow it to prepare a final report on its past nuclear program. The Obama administration is defending the nuclear deal with Iran against strong opposition by some lawmakers who also criticize the IAEA for not releasing its own agreement with Iran to resolve concerns about Iran's nuclear past. "I explained that my legal obligation is to protect safeguards confidentiality and this is an essential element of the international safeguards regime," IAEA head Yukiya Amano said after meeting U.S. politicians this week.

News article:
New evidence suggests that vehicles parked near Iran’s Parchin nuclear site have been there for years and may not indicate illicit cleanup efforts, as suggested last week by a Washington research group. Images taken in the past five years show that there have always been approximately 20 vehicles parked at the Parchin site, which is suspected of being used for experiments related to weaponization of Iran’s nuclear technology, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday. David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, had suggested that the satellite images may show “Iran’s last-ditch effort to eradicate evidence” of nuclear weapons development at Parchin prior to planned inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Intelligence analyst and former US nuclear-weapons scientist Robert Kelley denied the Washington-based institute’s claims. “The ‘parking lot of death’ has been imaged dozens of times and there are clear patterns of passenger cars parked there,” he said “There have been no indicators of a change in Iranian activities of any significance — no earth moving or sanitization whatsoever.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Kelley also suggested that the vehicles likely belonged to workers at a nearby explosives plant. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Saturday that the vehicles were for the purposes of road work, not cleanup. “We have announced that road construction operations are being carried out at Parchin,” Zarif told reporters in Tehran, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. Claims to the contrary, he said, were “lies,” he said. “All allegations against the Islamic Republic of Iran in this ground have always been baseless.” Advertisement Paul Ingram, executive director of the British American Security Information Council, dismissed suspicions of Parchin cleanup efforts as exaggerated. “Parchin is an active site and movement is inevitable. Attempting an impossible cleanup in full view of satellites and just before Congressional votes would be stretching conspiracy theories beyond breaking point,” he said. Satellite images of the vehicles at Parchin were circulated to US lawmakers, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence met with politicians in July to explain their significance. After seeing the images, some of the officials expressed concern that what they were seeing was a possible breach of last month’s nuclear agreement. “I think it’s up to the administration to draw their conclusions. Hopefully this is something they will speak on, since it is in many ways verified by commercial imagery. And their actions seem to be against the grain of the agreement,” Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said.

Baku, Azerbaijan, Aug. 17 By Fatih Karimov - Trend: Iran says foreign inspectors will be allowed to visit nuclear facilities in the country, only after the approval of Iran's Intelligence Ministry. "In order to visit the country, the International Atomic Energy Agency will introduce its inspectors in advance and they will be checked by Iran's security agencies," Fars News Agency quoted Iran's deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs, Abbas Araqchi as saying August 17. Araqchi added that only after the approval of the Intelligence Ministry visa would be issued for the inspectors, the report says. According to the report, he further stressed no one without the mentioned approval would be able to visit Iran as nuclear inspectors. The major world powers (the US, UK, France, Russia, China, and Germany) and the Islamic Republic of Iran reached a long-awaited comprehensive deal called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on July 14. It's expected that the agreement will be implemented by the end of the current year after being ratified in Congress and Iran's parliament as well as when the international Atomic Energy Agency confirms that Iran is cooperating with this UN body based on mutual agreement between Iran and IAEA, achieved simultaneously with JCPOA. Araghchi said July 30 during a speech on TV that Iran will only allow inspectors from countries that have diplomatic relations with Tehran. He said that Canadian and the U.S. origin inspectors would not be allowed in Iran. Araqchi also said during a meeting with the members of the National Security and Foreign Policy Commission of the Parliament that during the verification process, the IAEA would introduce 150 inspectors to Iran to inspect the country's nuclear activities. He also said that some measures have been taken so that investigation and inspections of the IAEA from Iran's military sites wouldn't lead to revealing the country's army secrets to foreigners". While ignoring the objections of both Iran and U.S. lawmakers, the implementation of nuclear agreement depends on verification of Iran's nuclear program by the IAEA.

News article:
Iranian officials warned Yukiya Amano, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), that he would lose their trust in the event that he discloses the content of the Tehran regimes’ secret agreements with the international nuclear watchdog, according to a report Monday in Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency. Behrouz Kamalvandi, the spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) said that if Amano had disclosed the terms of the agreements, “he himself would have been harmed.” Iran’s Ambassador to the IAEA, Reza Najafi, added that the agency had secret agreements with all member states that it was obliged to protect. “The discussions revealed that the secret texts between Iran and the Agency have not even been provided to the US administration,” Najafi said. “For the very same reason, they cannot be presented to the Senate members either.” Ali Akhbar Salehi, the head of the AEOI, said that his agreement to resolve all issues of Iran’s past nuclear work “will be implemented with full respect to Iran’s red lines.” Iran has insisted that inspectors will not be allowed into military sites, including Parchin. Access to Parchin,where Iran is believed to have tested detonators for a nuclear device, is essential for clarifying the full extent of the possible military dimensions (PMD) of Iran’s nuclear program. Last week, satellite images suggested that Iran was further sanitizing Parchin. Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif insisted that the only work going on at Parchin was road construction. However, David Albright, a former weapons inspector and head of the Institute for Science and International Security, responded in an op-ed that was published in The Washington Post that Zarif’s reaction to the revelation showed that Iran’s “recent actions are the start of such a reinterpretation of the agreement.” At the end of July, Iran filed a complaint with the IAEA claiming that the United States was in material breach of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Part of the complaint seemed to be a warning directed towards the IAEA, stating, “in implementing this procedure as well as other transparency measures, the IAEA will be requested to take every precaution to protect commercial, technological and industrial secrets as well as other confidential information coming to its knowledge.” The Iranian understanding of the IAEA’s procedures doesn’t comport with that of former deputy director-general of the IAEA, Olli Heinonen, who said that there are procedures in place that would allow a member state of the IAEA’s board of governors to request the distribution of the same side agreements that Iran claims are absolutely confidential.

News article:
Iran will be allowed to use its own experts to look for signs of nuclear weapons work at a contested military facility, according to The Associated Press, in a disclosure that is sure to further inflame criticism of a secret component of the nuclear deal. The secret agreement signed between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regarding the Parchin facility has emerged as one of the most contested aspects of the multinational deal signed by the U.S., Iran and five other world powers. {mosads}The AP report confirms allegations made by members of Congress, who have not been able to see the document for themselves. Earlier this summer, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said that the details of the agreement “would not be unlike causing athletes to just mail in their own urine specimens in the mail, and us believing that it came from them.” House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and other GOP lawmakers were quick to blast the “secret” agreement Wednesday. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) — the No. 2 Senate Republican — said the deal is based on a “remarkably naïve” trust of Iran. “This type of unorthodox agreement has never been done before by the IAEA and speaks to the great lengths our negotiators took to accommodate the Ayatollah despite repeated assurances from the administration that this deal is not based on trust,” Corker added in a statement. The former deputy director general of the IAEA, Olli Heinonen, told the AP that he could not think of a single instance in which a country being monitored for nuclear work has been allowed to do its own investigations. Analysts suspect Iran previously tested detonators for nuclear devices at the Parchin military facility. In recent weeks, intelligence assessments and commercial satellite photographs have suggested that Iran may have been scrubbing the site of any past nuclear work in the run-up to inspections. Under the terms of the agreement, Iran has agreed to provide the IAEA with photos and videos of areas that may be linked to weapons work. Exceptions will be made for “military concerns,” the AP reported. That suggests that international inspectors will not have complete access, even to secondhand reports of suspected weaponization sites. The White House has repeatedly denied allegations that the bilateral agreement between Iran and the IAEA is a “secret side-deal” to the main nuclear accord. Instead, it has insisted that the terms of the IAEA’s inspections regime always remain confidential and that that secret nature of those agreements is a core part of the international body’s work. On Wednesday, it expressed confidence that the IAEA’s ability to investigate Iran’s alleged efforts to build a nuclear weapon under the terms of the agreement. “We are confident in the agency’s technical plans for investigating the possible military dimensions of Iran’s former program,” said National Security Council spokesman Ned Price. “Just as importantly, the IAEA is comfortable with arrangements, which are unique to the agency’s investigation of Iran’s historical activities.” Price declined to comment on the details of the report. Administration officials have not been able to review the text of the agreement between Iran and the IAEA themselves, but they have maintained that they have been fully briefed on their terms and are “satisfied” by what they have heard. Those briefings have been relayed to members of Congress by officials, including IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano, though lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed frustration that they cannot get the agreements’ actual text. –Jordan Fabian contributed to this report, which was updated at 6:26 p.m.

News article:
The State Department on Thursday said “in no way” did the UN atomic watchdog agree to let Iran inspect its own nuclear facilities, rejecting revelations of a secret side deal between the Islamic Republic and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Associated Press reported Wednesday on a previously undisclosed side deal between Iran and the IAEA that would allow Tehran to use its own inspectors to investigate a site it has been accused of using to develop nuclear arms at least a decade ago. The IAEA wishes to investigate the site in order to learn more about Iran’s past activities there. State Department spokesman John Kirby dismissed the report, saying in “no way” would the UN nuclear agency cede its oversight to Iran. “That is not how the IAEA does business,” Kirby said in a statement, according to Reuters. Responding to the report on the side deal, Olli Heinonen, in charge of the Iran investigation as IAEA deputy director general from 2005 through 2010, told AP on Wednesday he could think of no similar arrangement — a country essentially allowed to carry out much of the probe of suspicions against it. The report, based on a document seen by the AP, newly riled Republican lawmakers who have been severely critical of the broader agreement to limit Iran’s future nuclear programs, signed by the Obama administration, Iran and five world powers in July. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The critics have complained that the wider deal is unwisely built on trust of the Iranians, while the administration has insisted it depends on reliable inspections. “President Obama boasts his deal includes ‘unprecedented verification.’ He claims it’s not built on trust,” said the Republican leader of the House, Speaker John Boehner, “But the administration’s briefings on these side deals have been totally insufficient — and it still isn’t clear whether anyone at the White House has seen the final documents.” But in an interview with the AP, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi questioned the significance of the disclosure, noting it relates to investigations of past military work, not nuclear dealings going forward. “I truly believe in this agreement,” she said. Advertisement And she asserted that House Democrats have the votes to uphold any Obama veto of a congressional resolution disapproving of the Iran agreement. Congress will vote next month on such a resolution, but if it is approved Obama has pledged to veto it. A two-thirds vote in the House and Senate would then be necessary to override him — a tough goal to reach even in a Congress controlled by Republicans who will likely oppose Obama unanimously. “The president’s veto would be sustained” if the vote were held today, Pelosi said, adding she hopes it doesn’t get to that point. “But I feel very confident about it. … We will sustain the veto.” The director general of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, reacted to the AP story with a statement Thursday defending the agreement the agency reached with Iran concerning the Parchin military site. He said he was disturbed that the AP report “suggested” that the IAEA has given responsibility for nuclear inspections to Iran. While noting the side deal is confidential, he said, “I can state that the arrangements are technically sound and consistent with our long-established practices. They do not compromise our safeguards standards in any way.” Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman of Iran’s nuclear agency was quoted on state TV calling the AP report “media speculation” without denying its substance. The document seen by the AP is a draft that one official familiar with its contents said doesn’t differ substantially from the final version. He demanded anonymity because he isn’t authorized to discuss the issue. Advertisement It is labeled “separate arrangement II,” indicating there is another confidential agreement between Iran and the IAEA governing the agency’s probe of the nuclear weapons allegations. The document suggests that instead of carrying out their own probe, IAEA staff will monitor Iranian personnel as they inspect the Parchin nuclear site. Iran will provide agency experts with photos and videos of locations the IAEA says are linked to the alleged weapons work, “taking into account military concerns.” That wording suggests that — beyond being barred from physically visiting the site — the agency won’t get photo or video information from areas Iran says are off-limits because they have military significance. IAEA experts would normally take environmental samples for evidence of any weapons development work, but the agreement stipulates that Iranian technicians will do the sampling.

News article:
Israel on Thursday demanded the publication of undisclosed agreements reached between Iran and the UN International Atomic Energy Agency, after a report on part of the accord detailed Iran’s ability to police itself at a suspected military nuclear site. An Israeli diplomatic official said the report had proven Israeli opposition to the nuclear deal reached between Iran and world powers correct. “There is just one safe way to verify this report: for the world powers to publicize all appendixes to the nuclear deal with Iran,” a diplomatic official said. The IAEA has refused to publicize details of the agreements it reached with Tehran, but on Wednesday, the Associated Press reported the nuclear watchdog ceded the responsibility of nuclear inspections at the Parchin military complex to Tehran officials. The IAEA inspection of Parchin, a site believed by some experts to be where Iran has previously experimented with high-explosive detonators for nuclear arms, is linked to a broader probe of allegations that the Islamic Republic has worked on atomic weapons in the past. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “The more details we learn about the Iran deal the more we realize that our worries were justified and correct,” the Israeli official said. The Parchin deal is a side agreement worked out directly between the IAEA and Iran, and is not linked directly to the multilateral nuclear deal signed on July 14, though the US says it will only ease sanctions once the atomic watchdog gives its stamp of approval. The United States and five other world powers that signed the July 14 nuclear agreement were not party to the Parchin deal but were briefed on it by the IAEA and endorsed it as part of the larger package. The IAEA said the organization was required by law not to reveal the details of its agreements with Iran. Advertisement Earlier on Thursday, the IAEA said it was was satisfied with arrangements concerning the inspection of Iranian military facilities, and an agency spokesman said the arrangements were “consistent with the IAEA verification practice and they meet the IAEA requirements.” IAEA head Yukiya Amano called the agreement “technically sound” and said the AP report had misrepresented his agency’s work. The White House also endorsed the confidential arrangements, and said it was “confident” in the abilities of the IAEA to monitor and inspect the possible military dimensions on Iran’s past nuclear work and was “comfortable” with agreement between the IAEA and Tehran to ensure compliance with the nuclear deal. Iran has refused access to Parchin for years. Based on US, Israeli and other intelligence and its own research, the IAEA suspects that the Islamic Republic may have experimented with high-explosive detonators for nuclear arms at that military facility. The IAEA has also repeatedly cited evidence, based on satellite images, of possible attempts to sanitize the site since the alleged work stopped more than a decade ago. Israel has repeatedly slammed the nuclear deal concluded by the P5+1 powers and Iran, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu branding it a historic mistake that will both pave Iran’s path to the bomb and, by lifting sanctions, cement the Islamist regime in power and allow it to fund more terrorist activity and other dangerous regional interventions. AP contributed to this report.

The Associated Press said Wednesday it has seen what it calls a "secret agreement" between Iran and the IAEA and endorsed by the six world powers that negotiated the nuclear deal with Iran - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia, and the U.S. AP says, under the agreement, Iran itself will send its own inspectors and equipment to the Parchin nuclear site, where Iran has been suspected of trying to develop a nuclear weapon. Iran has consistently denied the charge and has refused to allow international inspectors into the site.

He said as part of the nuclear deal with Tehran, the IAEA must be satisfied that Iran is fully cooperating with any investigation that it may have at one time tried to develop a nuclear weapon.

Reported Nuclear Side Deal Allows Iran to Do Self-Inspections August 20, 2015 by Victor Beattie A draft of a side agreement to the Iranian nuclear agreement between the U.N. atomic watchdog agency and Tehran will allow Iran to use its own inspectors to investigate the secretive Parchin nuclear site, the Associated Press reported. The revelation comes just weeks before the U.S. Congress votes on whether to reject the deal. The Obama administration expressed confidence Wednesday in the technical plans of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for investigating Parchin, a military base south of Tehran, and previous possible military dimensions of Iran’s nuclear program. U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said that while familiar with the contents, he would not comment directly on the purported draft IAEA document. "The IAEA is comfortable with arrangements which are unique to the agency’s investigation of Iran’s historical activities," Kirby noted. "When it comes to monitoring Iran's behavior going forward, the IAEA has separately developed the most robust inspection regime ever peacefully negotiated to ensure Iran’s current program remains exclusively peaceful – the overarching objective" of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. ​​Routine deal Kirby described the confidential arrangement between Iran and the IAEA as routine with other nations. "What the deal has endorsed is ensuring that ... possible military dimensions of their program have been adequately addressed by the IAEA.," he said. "That is what the P5+1 has endorsed. ... That process, that goal, that achievement is part of the roadmap going forward because, as we said, until those concerns are adequately addressed by the IAEA, there can be no sanctions relief under this deal," Kirby added. The side agreement, known as "separate arrangement 2," diverges from normal procedures, AP reported, by allowing Iran to employ its own experts and equipment in the search for evidence of activities it has consistently denied: trying to develop nuclear weapons. ​​US congressional reaction But House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce said, "International inspections should be done by international inspectors. Period." "Congress must now consider whether this unprecedented arrangement will keep Iran from cheating. This is a dangerous farce," he said in a statement. Congress is expected to vote on the Iran nuclear agreement when it returns from a recess next month. Ambassador James Jeffries, who served in the George W. Bush administration and is now a distinguished fellow at the Washington Institute on Near East Policy, expressed shock over this latest revelation and insisted the Iranians cannot be trusted. "I’m increasingly of the view that this administration will do anything to avoid challenging or irritating the Iranians," Jeffries said. "This was a country that was pursuing nuclear weapons at that site [Parchin]. I know that. I’ve seen the intelligence. This is going to reverberate very, very broadly around Congress, as it should." ​​Possible veto If Congress passes a vote of disapproval, President Barack Obama has pledged to veto it. Congress would then need a two-thirds vote in both chambers to override the veto. Jeffries said that while the White House will lose votes on this latest report, it is unlikely to derail the agreement. Regional analyst Stephen Zunes of the University of San Francisco said criticism of the draft side agreement is overblown, adding the IAEA has a good track record of monitoring nuclear activity around the world. "They do not let countries get away with self-inspections that would, in any way, threaten their ability to monitor the development, possibly, of nuclear weapons," Zunes said. He said the Parchin facility "has been used for testing new explosives, new engines for missiles and the like, which could have application to nuclear weapons. "However, given that there will be very direct, intrusive inspections regarding the enrichment of uranium, and other activities that could lead to fissile materials, in many ways this is not relevant. If they don’t have the fissile material to develop a nuclear weapon, it's not a threat," he added. 'Most intrusive' inspections Zunes views the overall agreement as containing the most intrusive inspections regime of any country not defeated in war. The IAEA has sought access to Parchin to corroborate intelligence suggesting Tehran conducted tests on nuclear triggering devices. According to the AP, Iran is to provide the IAEA with photos and videos of locations it says are linked to alleged weapons work “taking into account military concerns.” That suggests the agency will be barred from physically accessing the site.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print NCRI – Iran’s regime will be allowed to use its own inspectors to investigate a site it has been accused of using to develop nuclear arms, operating under a secret agreement with the U.N. agency that normally carries out such work, The Associated Press reported on Wednesday. Yet, little attention has been paid to the man whose signature is on the agreement on behalf of Tehran. Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) General Ali Hosseini-Tash, a former Deputy Defense Minister and a key official in charge of the regime’s nuclear weaponization, is the counterpart of the IAEA regarding the inspection of Parchin, which is suspected to be a site for nuclear related activities. IRGC Brigadier General Ali Hosseini-Tash is one of the most prominent officials involved in the Iranian regime’s nuclear weapons program. In his position as head of the research section of the Ministry of Defense and as Deputy Minister of Defense, from February 2004 until September 2005, he oversaw the organ in charge of the weaponization aspect of the nuclear project (at the time called Center for Development of Advanced Defense Technology). On November 19, 2004, in a press conference in Paris, the Iranian Resistance revealed that IRGC Brigadier General and Deputy Minister of Defense Ali Hosseini-Tash was pursuing the nuclear weapons project along with Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, and a biological weapons project with an individual named Nader Maghsoudi. Hosseini-Tash reported these activities directly to Ali Shamkhani, the then-Minister of Defense. Parchin site was one of the most important locations used by the Center for Development of Advanced Defense Technology. Saeed Borji, a confidant of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh and an explosives expert, was a key director of this organ. He was in direct contact with the Ukrainian expert Vycheslav V. Danilenko, who oversaw the construction of explosive chamber(s) used in Parchin. Borji was the head of the “Center for Explosives, Blast Research and Technologies” (Farsi acronym METFAZ), a subdivision of the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research (SPND), which is currently in charge of weaponization projects. Danilenko shared his experiences with Borji. When Parchin was being used for these experiments, Hosseini-Tash directly supervised the organ that worked on weaponization. “Ali Hosseini-Tash is a senior IRGC commander, who has been in charge of advancing Tehran’s bomb-making projects for many years. In this position, he has been intimately involved in every detail of the nuclear weapons program and is fully aware of the program’s vulnerabilities and concealment tactics,” said Shahin Gobadi, of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), based in Paris. “Allowing the Tehran regime to inspect Parchin and provide the results to the IAEA is akin to allowing a murderer to investigate his own murder and provide the relevant DNA to the police,” he said on Saturday. “Keeping these side agreements confidential under the pretext of confidentiality of agreements between the IAEA and the regime not only blocks independent scrutiny of viability of the process but also enables the regime to further cheat and conceal the previous military dimensions of its nuclear work.” “That the official in charge of the weaponization work is apparently going to oversee the implementation of inspection at Parchin makes it palpably clear that Tehran is in no way serious as it relates to transparency and verification and that it has every intention to engage in deception, denial and duplicity regarding its past weaponization work as it has done in the past two decades,” Mr. Gobadi added. The NCRI first revealed Hosseini-Tash’s role in the nuclear weapons program at a press conference on April 28, 2004 by Mr. Mohammad Mohaddessin, Chairman of the NCRI Foreign Affairs Committee.

News article:
The United Nations atomic watchdog chief sought Tuesday to ease concerns in the United States about his agency’s investigation into Iran’s alleged past nuclear activities following July’s landmark deal with major powers. “The arrangements made with Iran are technically sound and consistent with IAEA safeguards… They do not compromise our standards in any way,” International Atomic Energy Agency chief Yukiya Amano said at a meeting in Vienna. Under the July 14 agreement aimed at ending a 13-year standoff, Iran will dramatically reduce in scale its nuclear activities in order to make any dash to produce atomic weapons all but impossible. It will be up to the IAEA, which already has up to 10 inspectors in Iran every day, to verify that Iran sticks to its commitments and does not divert material to any covert nuclear weapons drive. This will require additional material and personnel, and Amano on Monday called on member states to provide an additional $10.6 million (9.2 million euros) in annual funding. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms But the July deal is not just about Iran’s present and future activities; it is also about what the Islamic Republic may have done in the past. The IAEA also wants to investigate allegations that at least until 2003 Iran conducted research into developing nuclear weapons. Tehran denies this. On the same day as Iran’s deal with the six powers, it also signed with the IAEA a separate “road map” deal aimed at closing for good the thorny “possible military dimensions” file by the end of the year. Advertisement Iran provided to the IAEA on August 15 “explanations in writing, and related documents” which the watchdog will review by September 15. Follow-up meetings and inspections have to be done by October 15 and Amano will issue a final report by December 15. However, details of how this investigation will work, as well as a separate agreement regarding the Parchin military base where explosives testing allegedly took place, are confidential. When asked if the IAEA had reached any conclusions regarding Iran’s military ambitions, Amano told reporters the agency was “still working on its assessment.” This has raised concerns among opponents to the main deal with Iran — which US lawmakers still have to approve — that Iran will hoodwink the IAEA. This might include the IAEA still not having access to sites such as Parchin, relying instead on the Iranians to provide soil samples and imagery. After the address, Amano told reporters that the implementation would not require a large number of inspectors to be in Iran to ensure the parameters of the nuclear accord were being met. Advertisement “Verification will be done in other ways,” he said. “We have advanced technology and while inspectors are important, we will use other methods of verification.” Amano said there would not be a “dramatic” increase of agency inspectors on Iranian soil, “a substantial increase, but not a dramatic one.” Asked if he felt IAEA was being used as scapegoat by opponents of the nuclear deal, Amano stressed the agency was not a political organization, and only tasked with verifying the terms of the agreement. “We are focusing on the technical elements from the verification point of view of the JCPOA,” he told reporters. The agreement, Amano said, was a “net gain” for the IAEA. Last week, US Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush, denouncing the wider Iran deal as “a farce,” said that “inspections of state sponsors of terrorism can’t work on the honor system.” Iran’s ambassador to the IAEA, Reza Najafi, on Tuesday refused to be drawn on providing more details of the investigation, including on Parchin. “We have some procedures, some arrangements (with the IAEA), which are confidential. I cannot disclose those arrangements. This is not only the commitment of Iran, it is also the commitment of the agency. We cannot discuss the details of any arrangement whatsoever,” Najafi told reporters. “I am not responsible for what happens in Washington.”

However, details of how this investigation will work, as well as a separate agreement regarding the Parchin military base where explosives testing allegedly took place, are confidential. This has raised concerns among opponents to the main deal with Iran — which US lawmakers still have to approve — that Iran will hoodwink the IAEA. This might include the IAEA still not having access to sites such as Parchin, relying instead on the Iranians to provide soil samples and imagery. US Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush, denouncing the wider Iran deal as “a farce”, said last week that “inspections of state sponsors of terrorism can’t work on the honour system”. Iran’s ambassador to the IAEA, Reza Najafi, on Tuesday refused to be drawn on providing more details of the investigation, including on Parchin. “We have some procedures, some arrangements (with the IAEA), which are confidential. I cannot disclose those arrangements. This is not only the commitment of Iran, it is also the commitment of the agency. We cannot discuss the details of any arrangement whatsoever,” Najafi told reporters. “I am not responsible for what happens in Washington.” The IAEA also said on Tuesday that it will run out of money next month to monitor implementation of nuclear accords with Tehran and asked countries to increase funding the costs of its Iran work, which will rise to $10 million a year. IAEA chief Yukiya Amano said he had asked member states for contributions to ensure its work can go ahead. Under the agreement reached between Tehran and six world powers on July 14, sanctions relief for Iran hinges on IAEA reports on its past and present nuclear programme. So far, costs for the IAEA’s activities on Iran have been met through extra-budgetary contributions from member states. But Amano said the 800,000 euros ($924,000) per month the agency receives to verify current Iran nuclear agreements would be exhausted by the end of next month. The IAEA will need an additional 160,000 euros per month in the run-up to the implementation of the agreement which could happen in the first half of next year. Once it is implemented, the agency will need an annual 9.2 million euros ($10.6 million) to ensure verification of the deal.

News article:
Vienna: The UN atomic watchdog chief sought on Tuesday to ease concerns in the United States about its investigation into Iran’s alleged past nuclear activities following July’s landmark deal with major powers. “The arrangements made with Iran are technically sound and consistent with IAEA safeguards practices. They do not compromise our standards in any way,” International Atomic Energy Agency chief Yukiya Amano said at a meeting in Vienna. Under the July 14 agreement aimed at ending a 13-year standoff, Iran will dramatically reduce in scale its nuclear activities in order to make any dash to produce atomic weapons all but impossible. It will be up to the IAEA, which already has up to 10 inspectors in Iran every day, to verify that Iran sticks to its commitments and does not divert material to any covert nuclear weapons drive. This will require additional material and personnel, and Amano on Monday called on member states to provide an additional 9.2 million euros ($10.6 million) in annual funding. But the July deal is not just about Iran’s present and future activities, it is also about what the Islamic republic may have done in the past. The IAEA also wants to investigate allegations that at least until 2003 Iran conducted research into developing nuclear weapons. Tehran denies this. On the same day as Iran’s deal with the six powers, it also signed with the IAEA a separate “road map” deal aimed at closing for good the thorny “possible military dimensions” file by the end of the year. Iran provided to the IAEA on August 15 “explanations in writing, and related documents” which the watchdog will review by September 15. Follow-up meetings and inspections have to be done by October 15 and Amano will issue a final report by December 15.

News article:
Iran says 'will not accept' leaks of secret data by IAEA Iran Press TV Aug 25, 2015 1:11PM Iran has called on the UN nuclear monitoring body to guarantee the confidentiality of information it will collect for verifying the peaceful nature of Tehran’s nuclear program. Iran’s ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Tuesday that the body should “exercise utmost vigilance to ensure full protection of all confidential information coming to its knowledge” during its inspections of Iran’s nuclear facilities under Tehran’s nuclear agreement with the six world powers. “We will not accept any kind of leakage of classified information by anyone,” Reza Najafi said. He reiterated Iran’s commitment to the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), inked between Iran and the six powers – the US, France, Britain, China, Russia and Germany – in July. Najafi also said Iran hopes for the “meaningful realization of fundamental shift” in the UN Security Council’s approach toward its nuclear dossier, following Resolution 2231 adopted in confirmation of JCPOA. Roadmap technically sound: Amano Also on Tuesday, the IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said in a statement to the Board of Governors that Iran's recent agreement with the nuclear monitoring agency is "technically sound and consistent with established IAEA safeguards practices.” He emphasized that the agreement did not “compromise” the agency’s standards “in any way.” In line with a roadmap signed between Iran and the IAEA in mid-July, Tehran provided the agency with explanations in writing and related documents on August 15 in order to clarify past and present outstanding issues pertaining to its nuclear program, Amano said. As agreed in the roadmap, all activities are set to be completed by October 15, the IAEA chief said. He added that he would present his final assessment of Iran's nuclear activities to the Board of Governors by December 15. “As with all my reports, this assessment will be factual and impartial,” Amano said. Iran’s Vice President and Head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi, and the IAEA chief signed a roadmap for “the clarification of past and present issues” regarding Iran’s nuclear program in the Austrian capital, Vienna on July 14. The roadmap was aimed at accelerating and strengthening cooperation and dialogue between Iran and the IAEA with a view to resolving all outstanding issues by the end of 2015. Amano also expressed the IAEA’s readiness to “undertake the necessary work” regarding the JCPOA, noting that Iran and the P5+1 group of powers would set up a joint panel to monitor the implementation of the JCPOA. As requested by the UN Security Council, Amano added, Iran and the joint commission should “consult and exchange information, where appropriate, as specified in the JCPOA.” “We are ready to do this if authorized by the Board [of Governors],” the IAEA head said. He also noted that the IAEA will require an additional 9.2 million euros (10.6 million dollars) annually to conduct its inspection of Iran's nuclear facilities as required by the JCPOA. “The combination of comprehensive safeguards agreement and additional protocol, together with the verification and monitoring of Iran’s nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA, represents a very robust verification mechanism in Iran,” Amano said. He expressed hope that the sides would make full use of the current “historic opportunity” to resolve the Iran nuclear issue.

News article:
Iran’s role in inspecting its military facility and suspected nuclear site at Parchin, which was detailed in a recently leaked draft of a side agreement between the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Islamic Republic, departs “significantly from well-established and proven safeguards practices,” according to an analysis (.pdf) by Olli Heinonen, the former deputy director-general of the IAEA, that was published this week. Much of the current concerns arise from the reported arrangements worked out between the IAEA and Iran in the side documents to address PMD issues. If the reporting is accurate, these procedures appear to be risky, departing significantly from well-established and proven safeguards practices. At a broader level, if verification standards have been diluted for Parchin (or elsewhere) and limits imposed, the ramification is significant as it will affect the IAEA’s ability to draw definitive conclusions with the requisite level of assurances and without undue hampering of the verification process. According to Heinonen, the dilution of the verification regime at Parchin, which is crucial for establishing the extent of Iran’s past nuclear work and detecting any future illicit activities, is particularly significant given that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) will allow Iran to remain “a nuclear threshold state with a breakout time of about a year for the first ten years if the JCPOA is fully implemented.” Parchin and the PMD issues, given their relevance to understanding how far Iran has gone towards designing a nuclear weapon and its impact on overall safeguards, mean that confidence in IAEA verification cannot be set at a lower bar than accepted in the past. The fact is that under the JCPOA, the Islamic Republic retains a sizable nuclear infrastructure with a uranium-enrichment program exceeding its practical needs. In other words, Iran remains a nuclear threshold state with a breakout time of about a year for the first ten years if the JCPOA is fully implemented. Furthermore, Iran remains in non-compliance with its non-proliferation undertakings. This makes it all the more important that the IAEA is able to establish a credible baseline to ensure that Iran has halted its PMD activities and is able to monitor and provide early warning if such activities resume. If the parts of the leaked document and statements about Iranian sample taking at Parchin are correct, it raises questions that must be answered. Inspections are at the heart of the IAEA’s work, and the IAEA must have the opportunity to explain its decisions concerning Iran. At this stage, the said document has been judged within the IAEA to be too sensitive for public comment. The Agency Secretariat has decided against sharing it with its governing Board. But partial truths can be dangerous. The issue of confidentiality is an important matter for the IAEA. However, it should not be used as a blanket to stop legitimate questions, particularly regarding verification methods at Parchin. Historically, the IAEA has not viewed such issues as confidential. The IAEA and its member states have disclosed much more detailed facility-specific approaches at regular safeguards symposia. Additionally, in 2007 the IAEA Iran Work Plan6 addressing outstanding issues, accumulated over several years, was made available to all IAEA member states, and the Board also received a 2012 document from Iran related to very specific PMD questions,7 which happened while the IAEA was negotiating with Iran for greater clarity and access. Heinonen argued that, given the doubts about the reported inspections regime at Parchin, it would be advisable for “the IAEA and Iran, with support from the United States, to seek the release of the document in question,” and to address all relevant concerns about the inspections process for Parchin. He further noted that, in the past, such protocols have not been confidential. Heinonen concluded by writing that the issue isn’t “a matter of forcing a confession from Iran,” but rather helping the IAEA determine whether “Iran’s nuclear program remains purely peaceful.” Under the terms of the side agreement reached between the IAEA and Iran, a draft of which was published by the Associated Press (AP) last week, Tehran will be allowed to collect the evidence that the IAEA will evaluate to determine whether illicit nuclear work was ongoing at the Parchin military site. Iran is believed to have previously conducted experiments dealing with the detonation of a nuclear bomb at Parchin. The AP report sparked significant controversy, which Tom Nichols characterized as “attacking the reporters, rather than the story,” in a critique published in The Daily Beast. Heinonen has previously written that the IAEA has mechanisms that would allow for the side deals to be made available to its Board of Governors, of which the United States is a member. However, Iran has been adamant about not disclosing the contents of any side agreements, with Behrouz Kamalvandi, the spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) saying that if Yukiya Amano, the director-general of the IAEA, had disclosed the contents of the agreements, “he himself would have been harmed.” [Photo: AJC Berlin / YouTube ]

News article:
The cabinet approved today's reform in Israel Electric Corporation following two and a half hours of tumultuous debate. Despite criticism by minister from the Jewish Home Party and objections by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the vote was not postponed and the cabinet unanimously approved the reform. During the debate, Netanyahu again raised the subject of the state's petition to the High Court of Justice against the right of IEC workers to go on strike in opposition to structural changes in the economy and commented on the power of the workers' committees in monopolies. At the same time, the state is likely to announce in the coming days the withdrawal of its High Court of Justice petition against the Histadrut (General Federation of Labor in Israel) and the IEC workers' committee, following today's cabinet approval of the reform in IEC. The agreement was approved unanimously after both Netanyahu and Minister of Education Naftali Bennett admitted that "An electricity sector with reform is better than one without reform." Netanyahu said during the discussion that although the bottom line was that he supported the agreement, "There is a bottom line below the bottom line." Netanyahu noted in this context that while from a historical perspective, organized labor had grown following the industrial revolution and in the circumstances of child labor and exploitation of workers, "The situation today is the opposite, and people have to be protected from the committees."

News article:
Drafting Haredi yeshiva students is an ages-old controversy, which is reignited every few years, stirring up the political arena. The new challenge that has emerged, as was the case in the past, has come from the Supreme Court. From the Haredi perspective, the Supreme Court is the culprit and the only obstacle standing in the way of fully attaining their extortionist demands. It was Israel’s first President Chaim Weizmann who foresaw the ensuing existential battle over the unholy alliance of religion and politics. He wrote in 1947: “There are powerful religious communities in Palestine that now, under a democratic regime, will rightly demand to assert themselves. I think it is our duty to make it clear to them from the beginning that whereas the state will treat the true religious feelings of the community with the highest respect, it cannot turn the clock back to making religion the cardinal principle in the conduct of the state… it shall not control the ministries of state…. There will be a great struggle… I foresee something which will be perhaps reminiscent of the Kulturkampf in Germany, but we must be firm if we are to survive.” As many who follow Israel’s political life know, cries of “wolf, wolf!” foretelling of the government’s imminent collapse are common. Most of these are averted at the last minute either by the coalition government surrendering to the demands of those who hold a gun to their temples; by use of delay tactics (usually by the appointment of a committee to study the issue at hand); or by reaching a creative compromise. Two such crises are on the horizon now. One involves the conversion bill, which we addressed just recently. This week, the Supreme Court has handed Netanyahu some relief by agreeing to a six month postponement of the date the State is required to submit its response to pending petitions involving non-Orthodox conversions. These pending petitions and the anticipated ruling in support of these converts prompted the ultimatum from the Shas party, demanding that a conversion law be passed to preempt this court ruling. The second crisis involves the draft bill. Much like “Who is a Jew,” drafting Haredi yeshiva students is an ages-old controversy, which is reignited every few years, stirring up the political arena. In recent years, it was the 2013-2015 government coalition under pressure from the Yesh Atid party, which legislated a new draft bill, causing upheaval. It was summarily undone once the 2015 coalition was in place due to the Haredi parties’ demands. Every sanction and move towards religious freedom and equality advanced by the previous government were obliterated. The new government met the Haredi demands that no yeshiva student who refused to enlist would be forced to do so, and that no real sanctions would be applied any time soon to either the individuals who dodge the draft or the Yeshivas that provide them with shelter. The new challenge that emerged, as was the case in the past, came from the Supreme Court. It accepted petitions to nullify the new draft bill on constitutional grounds for presenting too serious a breach of the principle of equality. The Court declared the new law to be null and void, setting a date for a year henceforth for its ruling to take effect. That year ends in September 2018, and the race was on to find a new solution. And so, with delay tactics having been exhausted, with no plausible creative compromise on the horizon, and with the realization that even extremely willing political operators would not be able to withstand constitutional-judicial review, came the ominous initiative to castrate the Supreme Court. From the Haredi perspective, the Supreme Court is the culprit and the only obstacle standing in the way of fully attaining their extortionist demands. Their mindset happens to coincide with parallel frustrations on the part of some extreme right-wing political circles; the two have joined forces to bring the Supreme Court to its knees. This was the genesis of the “override clause” initiative, aimed at enabling political machinations to override Supreme Court rulings via counter-legislation. As expected, this is now back on the table. The head of United Torah Judaism faction in the Knesset (the ultra-Orthodox Ashkenazi party), MK Mozes stated this week that “The Council of the Great [Ones] of the Torah of Agudat Yisrael has decided unequivocally not to allow the [new] bill to pass. If it does, we will leave the government and the coalition… If there was the ‘override clause’ we wouldn’t be in this situation… [we should] return to our original bill and add the override clause to it… the IDF does not decide how many students will enlist from one high school or another so I don’t understand the claim that the IDF should be the one to decide how many [yeshiva students] will enlist, rather than the rabbis. Since when are the yeshivas tasked with providing soldiers for the IDF?”

JERUSALEM (JTA) — Israeli lawmakers gave preliminary approval to a bill that would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The legislation, an amendment to the Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law, would widen the scope of current anti-discrimination law. The bill was approved on its first reading by a vote of 37 to 36. It now goes to the Knesset’s House Committee for discussion and amendment, and then must pass a second and third reading in the Knesset plenum to become law. The legislation, which was sponsored by Knesset lawmakers Dov Henin of the Arab Joint List and Michal Rozin of Meretz, is not supported by the ruling government coalition. However, two members of the coalition voted for the legislation. Amir Ohana of the Likud Party, who is openly homosexual, and Merav Ben Ari of the Kulanu Party, who last year had a baby with a gay friend and is raising her by way of shared parenting both broke ranks and voted for the legislation. Coalition chairman David Amsalem told the Times of Israel that he permitted the lawmakers to vote their conscience without fear of reprisal. Under the amendment, wherever Israeli law refers to discrimination, it would automatically also be referring to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. “In view of the changes that have occurred in Israeli law since 1992, and in view of the frequent attacks on the LGBT community owing to sexual orientation or gender identity in the form of discrimination and harassment, the time has come to amend the interpretation law beyond the legal meaning,” according to the explanation accompanying bill, Ynet reported. Meanwhile, a draft bill is circulating in the ruling coalition that would allow same-sex couples to adopt in Israel. Under the proposed legislation, the requirement that only a couple made up of a man and a woman can adopt children would be dropped, Hadashot news reported.

JERUSALEM (JTA) — Israeli lawmakers gave preliminary approval to a bill that would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The legislation, an amendment to the Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law, would widen the scope of current anti-discrimination law. The bill was approved on its first reading by a vote of 37 to 36. It now goes to the Knesset’s House Committee for discussion and amendment, and then must pass a second and third reading in the Knesset plenum to become law. The legislation, which was sponsored by Knesset lawmakers Dov Henin of the Arab Joint List and Michal Rozin of Meretz, is not supported by the ruling government coalition. However, two members of the coalition voted for the legislation.

News article:
A top lawmaker from the opposition Zionist Union faction on Saturday sought to pressure the Yesh Atid party into opposing legislation addressing ultra-Orthodox military enlistment, saying an upcoming vote on the bill would serve in effect as a no-confidence vote in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. “The Zionist Union faction will turn the vote on the [military] draft law to a vote of ‘no-confidence in the Netanyahu government,’ meaning whoever votes in favor of the law is giving the Netanyahu government a green light to continue,” tweeted MK Yoel Hasson, who serves as chief opposition whip. “Yesh Atid and the ultra-Orthodox parties need to decide on Monday where they stand: For or against the government,” Hasson added. “Against the law and against the government, that is what is expected from the opposition.” Hasson’s message appeared to be aimed primarily at Yesh Atid, whose leader Yair Lapid has vowed that his opposition party will support the bill. A vote by Yesh Atid lawmakers in favor of the bill could allow its passage, despite threats from ultra-Orthodox members of the coalition to oppose the legislation. A failure to pass the bill could portend the government’s collapse. The tweet drew a quick rebuke from Yesh Atid MK Ofer Shelah. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “Don’t preach to us about enlistment or opposition work,” Shelah wrote on Twitter. “Yesh Atid will continue to do what is good for the state.” In a Facebook post earlier Saturday, Lapid defended his vow to support the bill and sought to fend off criticism that doing so could prevent the government’s collapse. “This is just a sentence someone said and everyone is repeating,” Lapid wrote, saying the coalition would likely survive even if the legislation fails in the Knesset. Advertisement While conceding it is the opposition’s role to challenge the government, Lapid, who has long campaigned in favor of drafting members of the ultra-Orthodox community, said the legislation “is what Yesh Atid fought for since day one.” The contentious legislation is the product of a Defense Ministry committee report published earlier this month. The ministry called the framework “a durable, realistic and relevant arrangement” for ultra-Orthodox conscription. The proposal sets minimum yearly targets for ultra-Orthodox conscription that, if not met, would result in financial sanctions on the yeshivas, or rabbinical seminaries, where they study. Netanyahu’s ultra-Orthodox coalition partners, the Shas and United Torah Judaism parties, have threatened to oppose the legislation if it advances, and even to destabilize the coalition, in order to torpedo the measure. On Sunday, in a meeting with coalition party leaders, Netanyahu insisted that the bill would move forward to a first plenum vote, but that “after the first reading, there will be a discussion between all parts of the coalition toward a broad agreement for the second and third readings.” He brushed off the Haredi threats to the coalition, saying, “I don’t want elections, but I’m not afraid of elections. If there are elections, I’ll be okay.” A bill must pass all three votes in the plenum to become law. Advertisement At Sunday’s meeting, the heads of both Haredi parties, Shas’s Aryeh Deri and UTJ’s Yaakov Litzman, reiterated their opposition to the bill. Both parties, however, have only vowed to oppose the “current version” of the bill, but have not said they are opposed in principle to its underlying framework. Last week, Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman of the secularist Yisrael Beytenu party expressed support for the bill. In September 2017, the High Court of Justice struck down a previous law exempting ultra-Orthodox men who were engaged in religious study from military service, saying it undermined the principle of equality before the law. However, the court suspended its decision for a year to allow for a new arrangement to be put in place, giving the government the option to pass a new law by September 1, 2018. The issue of ultra-Orthodox enlistment has long been a contentious one in Israel, revolving around a decades-old debate as to whether young ultra-Orthodox men studying in yeshivas should be called up for compulsory military service, like the rest of Israel’s Jewish population. United Torah Judaism’s Litzman said earlier this month that if an ultra-Orthodox-backed proposal dealing with the community’s conscription is not passed into law by July 22, when the Knesset summer recess begins, the party will leave the government, likely spelling its untimely end. But Litzman represents the Hasidic half of the UTJ party. The Lithuanian half, headed by MK Moshe Gafni, has been careful to avoid such pronouncements, as has Shas. The ultra-Orthodox parties have submitted two parallel bills on the military draft. The first, a quasi-constitutional Basic Law, would enshrine long-term Torah study as a recognized form of national service in lieu of military service. The second bill would force the Defense Ministry to grant deferrals to yeshiva students, and refers back to the proposed Basic Law repeatedly in defending the arrangements. The March deal delayed action on the issue, until the Defense Ministry presented its recommendations earlier this month.

News article:
Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid faction from the opposition has announced its plan to vote in favor of the IDF draft law in its first reading at the Knesset on Monday, but Zionist Union faction chairman Yoel Hasson says Yesh Atid lawmakers have pleaded with him to turn the vote into a motion of no confidence so that they would be able to vote against it. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Knesset Member Hasson told Ynet, “On Wednesday I was approached by MKs from Yesh Atid, who asked me, ‘Turn the vote into a motion of no confidence.’ They begged me to do it.” “I won’t say the names of those who approached me from Yesh Atid. They’re not against Lapid, but they think he’s wrong. So they said to me, ‘Do us a favor, make it a motion of no confidence so we can vote against this law.” MK Hasson. 'They begged me to do it' (Photo: Dana Koppel) Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the issue Sunday morning in a Likud ministers’ meeting, saying: “We will pass the draft law, barring any surprises. I want to pass everything now. On the other hand, there is a desire to postpone.” The existing Israeli Defense Service Law expires in September after the High Court of Justice deemed it unconstitutional, and so the Knesset must pass an alternative law before then. If a new law is not passed to regulate the exemptions of ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students, tens of thousands of them are expected to receive IDF draft orders. The proposed legislation includes planned cuts to the yeshivot's budgets and the use of economic incentives to pressure the Torah study institutions to encourage enlistment, but no criminal sanctions. Regardless of the claims raised by MK Hasson, the Zionist Union announced Saturday evening that it planned to turn the vote on the law into a motion of no confidence. Tensions increased in the opposition after Yesh Atid declared that it planned to vote in favor of the law. The coalition’s ultra-Orthodox parties, on the other hand, have announced that they will vote against it. MK Ofer Shelah, chairman of the Yesh Atid faction, said in response to Hasson’s claim: “The Zionist Union, which escaped the Haredi draft vote in the previous Knesset and crawled into the government in the current Knesset, shouldn’t preach us—neither about the draft law nor about opposition activity. Yesh Atid will keep working with the state’s best interest in mind.” MK Amsalem. 'There is no dialogue between us and Lapid' (Photo: Yoav Dudkevitch)) Coalition Chairman David Amsalem denied Sunday that there was any cooperation between Likud and Yesh Atid on the matter. “There is no dialogue between us and Lapid about the law,” he told Ynet. MK Hasson added that “turning the vote into a motion of no confidence is aimed at closing ranks in the opposition, waking Yesh Atid up a bit and saying to them, ‘You got carried away, you kind of failed to understand your position. You’re supposed to be an opposition.” But they thing it’s a good law, and they’ve stressed that it’s a law they passed which was cancelled, and now it’s back on the table. “They are wrong, both in principle and in essence. Why? Because, first of all, this law has no equality and no burden. This plan is a political plan aimed at serving as a bridge to overcome the political crisis. MK Amsalem knows the wording we are voting on now won’t be the wording that will be voted on in the second and third readings, because behind closed doors they will reach an agreed wording with the Haredim and will disregard Yair Lapid, who is now passing their wording.” MK Amsalem responded, “I’m not talking about this with the opposition. I see this as a good law for the people of Israel. I don’t see it as a coalition-opposition thing. With Yoel Hasson, everything is coalition-opposition. The people of Israel don’t exist. ‘Let’s bring down the government’ is what he cares about. Hasson, as usual, barely speaks the truth.” Hasson replied, “Why don’t you tell the viewers about your agreement with the Joint List, which will make them disappear or avoid voting against the law.” Haredi political leaders Deri, Litzman and Gafni. Will vote against the law (Photo: Ohad Zwigenberg, Alex Klomoisky and Gil Yohanan) “Yoel Hasson is misleading the public,” Amsalem said. “I have never spoken to the Arabs about this. The Arab parties have historically avoided participating in this issue. The Left is only interested in the Haredi issue right now, as if there are no Arabs.” “What we’re interested in, and that’s exactly what Amsalem said, is to bring down the government,” Hasson said. “In this case, there is a real chance to bring down the government.” Amsalem replied, “You won’t believe the amount of sweat in the Zionist Union’s feet when we almost went to elections. It’s the same today. They’re trembling and terrified. They are only making sounds of elections. They never intended on it. And if we go to elections, you’ll see they will be the first ones to cry, because half of them won’t make it to the Knesset.” Amsalem expressed his hope that the draft law would eventually be approved by the Knesset. “At the moment, this law is difficult for the Haredim, so they decided not to vote for it. The Zionist Union and the Left oppose the law, so I understand it’s a good law. If all sides oppose it, it must be perfectly fine for the people of Israel. Every bill we submit eventually goes down to the committees, where it undergoes different changes.” MK Zandberg. 'We have an opportunity to bring down the government' (Photo: Amit Shabi) Meretz leader Tamar Zandberg told Ynet on Sunday, “As an opposition, you have two options. You can either replace Bibi or join Bibi. We have stopped counting the wrongs caused by this government, led by Bibi Netanyahu. Now the question is: What does an opposition do in light of this situation? We have an option of uniting as an opposition and bringing down the government, or to drive a wedge between the different parts of the coalition. “I have trouble understanding the hand wrestling and mud slinging between e Zionist Union leader Avi Gabbay and Lapid, who announced he would support this draft law. Lapid, Shelah and all the Yesh Atid faction members announced over the weekend that they support the draft law, which is bad and is tearing the coalition apart. We have a real chance of driving a wedge between the different parts of the coalition and dissolving the government. I can’t understand this cowardice.” Don’t you believe them when they say that ideology is more important than politics? “What ideology is there here? I really find it difficult to understand. All I see is zigzagging and cowardice. And I see somewhere here that the polls may be more important than a real and significant political move that can be done as early as tomorrow. We heard voices from the Haredim saying, with a wink, that they’re against this law but that they actually really like it, and what Lapid is doing here to giving them a very easy way out to save the government from itself.”

It’s the same today. They’re trembling and terrified. They are only making sounds of elections. They never intended on it. And if we go to elections, you’ll see they will be the first ones to cry, because half of them won’t make it to the Knesset.” Amsalem expressed his hope that the draft law would eventually be approved by the Knesset. “At the moment, this law is difficult for the Haredim, so they decided not to vote for it. The Zionist Union and the Left oppose the law, so I understand it’s a good law. If all sides oppose it, it must be perfectly fine for the people of Israel.

We have an option of uniting as an opposition and bringing down the government, or to drive a wedge between the different parts of the coalition. “I have trouble understanding the hand wrestling and mud slinging between e Zionist Union leader Avi Gabbay and Lapid, who announced he would support this draft law.

We heard voices from the Haredim saying, with a wink, that they’re against this law but that they actually really like it, and what Lapid is doing here to giving them a very easy way out to save the government from itself.”

News article:
Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid faction from the opposition has announced its plan to vote in favor of the IDF draft law in its first reading at the Knesset on Monday, but Zionist Union faction chairman Yoel Hasson says Yesh Atid lawmakers have pleaded with him to turn the vote into a motion of no confidence so that they would be able to vote against it. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Knesset Member Hasson told Ynet, “On Wednesday I was approached by MKs from Yesh Atid, who asked me, ‘Turn the vote into a motion of no confidence.’ They begged me to do it.” “I won’t say the names of those who approached me from Yesh Atid. They’re not against Lapid, but they think he’s wrong. So they said to me, ‘Do us a favor, make it a motion of no confidence so we can vote against this law.” MK Hasson. 'They begged me to do it' (Photo: Dana Koppel) Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the issue Sunday morning in a Likud ministers’ meeting, saying: “We will pass the draft law, barring any surprises. I want to pass everything now. On the other hand, there is a desire to postpone.” The existing Israeli Defense Service Law expires in September after the High Court of Justice deemed it unconstitutional, and so the Knesset must pass an alternative law before then. If a new law is not passed to regulate the exemptions of ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students, tens of thousands of them are expected to receive IDF draft orders. The proposed legislation includes planned cuts to the yeshivot's budgets and the use of economic incentives to pressure the Torah study institutions to encourage enlistment, but no criminal sanctions. Regardless of the claims raised by MK Hasson, the Zionist Union announced Saturday evening that it planned to turn the vote on the law into a motion of no confidence. Tensions increased in the opposition after Yesh Atid declared that it planned to vote in favor of the law. The coalition’s ultra-Orthodox parties, on the other hand, have announced that they will vote against it. MK Ofer Shelah, chairman of the Yesh Atid faction, said in response to Hasson’s claim: “The Zionist Union, which escaped the Haredi draft vote in the previous Knesset and crawled into the government in the current Knesset, shouldn’t preach us—neither about the draft law nor about opposition activity. Yesh Atid will keep working with the state’s best interest in mind.” MK Amsalem. 'There is no dialogue between us and Lapid' (Photo: Yoav Dudkevitch)) Coalition Chairman David Amsalem denied Sunday that there was any cooperation between Likud and Yesh Atid on the matter. “There is no dialogue between us and Lapid about the law,” he told Ynet. MK Hasson added that “turning the vote into a motion of no confidence is aimed at closing ranks in the opposition, waking Yesh Atid up a bit and saying to them, ‘You got carried away, you kind of failed to understand your position. You’re supposed to be an opposition.” But they thing it’s a good law, and they’ve stressed that it’s a law they passed which was cancelled, and now it’s back on the table. “They are wrong, both in principle and in essence. Why? Because, first of all, this law has no equality and no burden. This plan is a political plan aimed at serving as a bridge to overcome the political crisis. MK Amsalem knows the wording we are voting on now won’t be the wording that will be voted on in the second and third readings, because behind closed doors they will reach an agreed wording with the Haredim and will disregard Yair Lapid, who is now passing their wording.” MK Amsalem responded, “I’m not talking about this with the opposition. I see this as a good law for the people of Israel. I don’t see it as a coalition-opposition thing. With Yoel Hasson, everything is coalition-opposition. The people of Israel don’t exist. ‘Let’s bring down the government’ is what he cares about. Hasson, as usual, barely speaks the truth.” Hasson replied, “Why don’t you tell the viewers about your agreement with the Joint List, which will make them disappear or avoid voting against the law.” Haredi political leaders Deri, Litzman and Gafni.

News article:
The proposed IDF draft bill was passed in the Knesset in its first reading early Tuesday, with 63 MKs voting in favor and 39 voting against. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Knesset Finance Committee Chairman MK Moshe Gafni (United Torah Judaism) and some of Shas's members of Knesset initially left the plenum during the vote, and returned to vote against the bill only after making sure the coalition had the majority it needed to pass the legislation, with Yesh Atid indeed voting in favor. MK Lapid and Deputy Minister Litzman (Photo: Ohad Zwigenberg) Following the vote, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who is not a member of Knesset and therefore did not vote, praised the passing of the first hurdle toward the legislation's approval. "The Knesset showed responsibility," he wrote on Twitter. "Stateliness has won over media spins and divisions. I hope the bill is approved in its current version in second and third readings as well and in this Knesset session," he added. Ahead of the vote, ultra-Orthodox MKs fiercely argued against the proposed legislation, with United Torah Judaism MK Yisrael Eichler even wondering, "Do you really want the Haredim in the army?" He determined that the Knesset had "no moral right to sanction Torah students. Imagine someone sanctioned students who don't adhere to a certain system of values. Where do you get the nerve to do that? There's a nuclear reactor here dismantling society." Instead of mandatory military service, Eichler proposed "to establish a professional army in which anyone who chooses to enlist will be appreciated and paid properly." Haredim watch the discussion from the Knesset's public gallery (Photo: Ohad Zwigenberg) The existing Israeli Defense Service Law expires in September after the High Court of Justice deemed it unconstitutional, and so the Knesset must pass an alternative law before then. If a new law is not passed to regulate the exemptions of ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students, tens of thousands of them are expected to receive IDF draft orders. The proposed legislation includes planned cuts to the yeshivot's budgets and the use of economic incentives to pressure the Torah study institutions to encourage enlistment, but no criminal sanctions. The enlistment objectives, as stated in the proposal, are that 3,000 yeshiva students will be drafted in the first stage and 600 will volunteer for national service. The plan will be given a two-year adaptation period, in which sanctions won’t be imposed if the yeshivot fail to meet the draft rates. In the third year, yeshivot who fail to encourage enlistment will be hit with economic sanctions if they drop below a 95-percent target. Earlier, Deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman threatened to quit the coalition if the IDF draft bill proposal is passed into law. "No one thinks or dreams that if (MK Yair) Lapid supports this bill, that we will support it too," Litzman, who leads the Hasidic Agudat Yisrael faction in United Torah Judaism, said at the Knesset. Deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman (Photo: Ohad Zwigenberg) "We need to get to a situation in which anyone who wants to study at a yeshiva can have an arrangement that allows him to continue studying uninterrupted, and that is why we will vote against the law," he explained. MK Gafni asserted that "had it not been for the Torah students, there would've been no existence to the world." He called on the Torah students "to continue studying the Torah. Those who study should continue and not listen to what's being said here." MK Uri Maklev (UTJ) dismissed the discussion over the law, saying "There's no real debate here, this is a dialogue between deaf people." He also noted that "equality is no value when put against our right to exist." Shas MK Yinon Azoulay also called on yeshiva students to continue studying. "I call on the Torah students, even if you reach a situation in which you have to sacrifice yourselves - don't stop your Torah studies," he said. Deputy Defense Minister Eli Ben-Dahan (Bayit Yehudi) explained to "those who incite against this law" that "We have no intention to go into yeshivot and get Torah students out of there. Anyone who studies Torah and Torah studying is his job will continue studying Torah. But those who stopped studying will enlist. This situation of no enlistments for decades cannot go on." Yesh Atid MK Yair Lapid, whose is in the opposition but is expected to nevertheless vote in favor of the legislation, pointed to the Haredi protests against the legislation taking place in Jerusalem as the Knesset was in session. "As we sit here, Haredi are rioting across Jerusalem, and they understand more Haredim will have to enlist and join the job market," he said. MK Yair Lapid (Photo: Ohad Zwigenberg) "There is no party more consistent than Yesh Atid on this issue. In the previous Knesset, the prime minister made impassioned speeches about the draft law we led. He and the justice minister (Ayelet Shaked), who were proud of the law, later voted against it," Lapid continued. He was referring to the legislation his party passed while they were in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's third government and the Haredi parties were in the opposition, which was amended in Netanyahu's fourth government after the Haredim returned to the coalition and his own party was left in the opposition. "This is a wound in the heart of Israeli society, and it will not heal until a law will be put on the Knesset's table like the one put there today, and we will all live here together as people who have a shared responsibility," he went on to say. "We need a law like this law so we know we're taking a step toward all of us carrying the same burden—the sacred duty to defend the people of Israel and the State of Israel." "I'm not the one who signed off on this bill. The IDF did. The IDF chief did. And we're going with what the IDF wanted," he concluded. (Photo: Ohad Zwigenberg) Joint List MK Dov Khenin came out against the proposed legislation as well, saying the IDF draft law "is a bluff that only feeds the politics of hatred, which almost everyone in the political system stand to gain from, but the public loses. The army doesn't want to draft Haredim either, and this law will only drive many of the Haredi youth away from the job market because they will have to study to avoid enlistment." He called to "cancel the restrictions that prevent the Haredim from joining the job market," explaining that "If we don't do this, we condemn a big public to continued life in poverty." "Instead of farfetched and unrealistic laws, we need to promote equality, not create a mechanism that further deepends discrimination and social gaps," Khenin argued. Coalition chairman David Amsalem, right, talks to UTJ MK Moshe Gafni (Photo: Ohad Zwigenberg) Meretz leader MK Tamar Zandberg aimed her attack at her fellow opposition members. "It's been a while since we've last seen such a masquerade. The world of imagery is insufficient for this purpose. Is Lapid the Messiah's donkey?" she wondered. "This week will be remembered as one of our great misses as members of the opposition. Instead of all of us rising above (our differences) and standing united against Netanyahu, the battle became one between (Zionist Union head) Gabbay and Lapid," Zandberg added, referring to an earlier exchange of accusations between the two MKs. Zandberg also attacked the legislation itself, telling UTJ heads Litzman and Moshe Gafni, "You know this law is Isra-bluff. There's no equality and no enlistment." MK Itzik Shmuli (Zionist Union) argued that previous IDF chief Benny Gantz "said the need for Haredi enlistment was operational and national. This isn't a political whim... this plan is giving the green light to draft dodging, and it could endanger the 'army of the people.' This plan has no economic and criminal sanctions, and without them we can't enforce anything." Zionist Union's Knesset faction leader MK Yoel Hasson pointed out that the legislation was different to a memorandum issued by the Defense Ministry. "As we said, this version is diminished because it includes the Zionist yeshiva students, who enlist anyway, in the annual enlistment quotas," he said. Before the vote commenced, coalition chairman David Amsalem announced there has been a technical error that included students from Hesder yeshivot (a Zionist reigious yeshiva program combining advanced Talmudic studies with military service) under the purview of the law. The Yesh Atid party asked Amsalem for a written commitment that the error was indeed only technical in nature and would be remedied in future versions of the legislation. Amsalem then wrote a document confirming this and signed it. But Hasson was unconvinced, telling the Yesh Atid party, "Don't trust a letter with false promises, this is a bluff."

News article:
Legislation addressing ultra-Orthodox military enlistment passed its first reading in the Knesset overnight Monday, in the first of three readings it must pass before becoming law. A majority of 63 to 39 lawmakers voted for the legislation after a stormy debate. The Yesh Atid faction of the opposition voted alongside the ruling coalition, ensuring the bill’s passage. The contentious legislation is the product of a Defense Ministry committee report published last month. The ministry called the plan “a durable, realistic and relevant arrangement” for ultra-Orthodox conscription. The proposal sets minimum yearly targets for ultra-Orthodox conscription that, if not met, would result in financial sanctions on the yeshivas, or rabbinical seminaries, where they study. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The bill sets the enlistment target for 2018 at 3,348, with targets rising by 5-8 percent every year, reaching 6,844 by 2027. Starting in 2020, if enlistment rates do not reach 95% of the target, funds for schools will be reduced accordingly. If rates do not reach 85% of the yearly target by 2023, the agreement will be canceled. The bill does not detail what the penalties for such cancellation would be. Yesh Atid officials asserted to Haaretz that this would then entail criminal penalties for any who evade enlistment, as is standard for any citizen. At the request of chief opposition whip MK Yoel Hasson of the opposition Zionist Union faction, the vote was defined as a no-confidence vote in the government. Advertisement The ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism and Shas parties both voted against the bill once they had confirmed that there were enough votes for it to pass. Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely, who is on maternity leave after giving birth two weeks ago, also came in to participate in the vote. After the bill passed Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman expressed his satisfaction, tweeting that “the Knesset showed responsibility.” Hasson tweeted that “the law passed with the determined help of Yesh Atid, that today expressed confidence in the Netanyahu government despite being a faction in the opposition, a dubious historical event…If they had not given their support, the law would not have passed.” The issue of ultra-Orthodox enlistment has long been a controversial one in Israel, revolving around a decades-old debate as to whether young ultra-Orthodox men studying in yeshivas should be called up for compulsory military service, like the rest of Israel’s Jewish population. Hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jews protested the bill Monday evening, gathering at the grave of late Israeli Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef to recite prayers, in a bid to increase pressure on the ultra-Orthodox Shas party to veto the legislation. Advertisement Zionist Union chairman Avi Gabbay slammed Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid earlier on Monday for supporting the controversial legislation, saying the party was betraying Israeli soldiers and its own voters by supporting the government-sponsored legislation, and claimed it would have no actual effect on the military draft. Rejecting Gabbay’s assessment that the bill would not change ultra-Orthodox enlistment rates, Lapid said that coalition ultra-Orthodox parties “will vote against the bill because they know it will mean more being enlisted,” adding that the law is supported by the IDF and its chief of staff. The leader of an ultra-Orthodox party had threatened earlier Monday to bring down the coalition if the bill becomes law. “If the enlistment law passes three readings, we will quit the coalition,” Deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman, who heads the United Torah Judaism party, said at the Knesset. Litzman said the decision to oppose the law was made by the Council of Torah Sages from his Hasidic Agudat Yisrael faction. It was not clear if Degel Hatorah, the non-Hasidic ultra-Orthodox faction in UTJ, would also quit the coalition if the bill passes into law. The coalition, which has 66 of 120 Knesset seats, needs UTJ’s 6 seats in order to preserve its majority. “We’re against sanctions and all types of other things in this law,” Litzman said. “We must reach a situation that anyone who wants to study at a religious seminary in Israel… will be able to continue studying undisturbed.” He also said his opposition to the bill will not be influenced by Yesh Atid’s support for it. “I’m sure that no one thinks or dreams that if Lapid supports this bill, we’ll support it,” Litzman said. Advertisement Lapid has argued that the legislation is close to a similar bill his party had pushed for in the past. Key differences are that the current bill does not call for criminal sanctions against students who dodge the draft — only economic penalties against the institutions where they study — and also has a lower quota for the number of ultra-Orthodox who will be drafted each year. Speaking at a faction meeting earlier Monday, Lapid stressed that his support for the bill was based on its acceptance by the Defense Ministry, and that his party would not support any changes to the proposal in committee debates ahead of its second and third Knesset readings. Responding to the Yesh Atid leader, Liberman told his own lawmakers that he “is not trying to please either Lapid or the ultra-Orthodox but the defense establishment.” He rejected possible changes to the current proposal such as removing the sanctions, saying any amendments could risk the bill being challenged by the High Court. “Everything you change opens a Pandora’s box. We will therefore only accept the law passing in its current version,” he said. The issue of ultra-Orthodox enlistment has long been a contentious one in Israel, revolving around a decades-old debate as to whether young ultra-Orthodox men studying in yeshivas should be called up for compulsory military service, like the rest of Israel’s Jewish population. In September 2017, the High Court of Justice struck down a previous law exempting ultra-Orthodox men who were engaged in religious study from military service, saying it undermined the principle of equality before the law. However, the court suspended its decision for a year, to allow for a new arrangement to be put in place, giving the government the opportunity to pass the new law by September 1, 2018.

Legislation addressing ultra-Orthodox military enlistment passed its first reading in the Knesset overnight Monday, in the first of three readings it must pass before becoming law. A majority of 63 to 39 lawmakers voted for the legislation after a stormy debate. The Yesh Atid faction of the opposition voted alongside the ruling coalition, ensuring the bill’s passage. The contentious legislation is the product of a Defense Ministry committee report published last month. The ministry called the plan “a durable, realistic and relevant arrangement” for ultra-Orthodox conscription. The proposal sets minimum yearly targets for ultra-Orthodox conscription that, if not met, would result in financial sanctions on the yeshivas, or rabbinical seminaries, where they study. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The bill sets the enlistment target for 2018 at 3,348, with targets rising by 5-8 percent every year, reaching 6,844 by 2027. Starting in 2020, if enlistment rates do not reach 95% of the target, funds for schools will be reduced accordingly. If rates do not reach 85% of the yearly target by 2023, the agreement will be canceled. The bill does not detail what the penalties for such cancellation would be. Yesh Atid officials asserted to Haaretz that this would then entail criminal penalties for any who evade enlistment, as is standard for any citizen. At the request of chief opposition whip MK Yoel Hasson of the opposition Zionist Union faction, the vote was defined as a no-confidence vote in the government. Advertisement The ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism and Shas parties both voted against the bill once they had confirmed that there were enough votes for it to pass. Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely, who is on maternity leave after giving birth two weeks ago, also came in to participate in the vote. After the bill passed Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman expressed his satisfaction, tweeting that “the Knesset showed responsibility.” Hasson tweeted that “the law passed with the determined help of Yesh Atid, that today expressed confidence in the Netanyahu government despite being a faction in the opposition, a dubious historical event…If they had not given their support, the law would not have passed.” The issue of ultra-Orthodox enlistment has long been a controversial one in Israel, revolving around a decades-old debate as to whether young ultra-Orthodox men studying in yeshivas should be called up for compulsory military service, like the rest of Israel’s Jewish population. Hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jews protested the bill Monday evening, gathering at the grave of late Israeli Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef to recite prayers, in a bid to increase pressure on the ultra-Orthodox Shas party to veto the legislation. Advertisement Zionist Union chairman Avi Gabbay slammed Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid earlier on Monday for supporting the controversial legislation, saying the party was betraying Israeli soldiers and its own voters by supporting the government-sponsored legislation, and claimed it would have no actual effect on the military draft. Rejecting Gabbay’s assessment that the bill would not change ultra-Orthodox enlistment rates, Lapid said that coalition ultra-Orthodox parties “will vote against the bill because they know it will mean more being enlisted,” adding that the law is supported by the IDF and its chief of staff. The leader of an ultra-Orthodox party had threatened earlier Monday to bring down the coalition if the bill becomes law. “If the enlistment law passes three readings, we will quit the coalition,” Deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman, who heads the United Torah Judaism party, said at the Knesset. Litzman said the decision to oppose the law was made by the Council of Torah Sages from his Hasidic Agudat Yisrael faction. It was not clear if Degel Hatorah, the non-Hasidic ultra-Orthodox faction in UTJ, would also quit the coalition if the bill passes into law. The coalition, which has 66 of 120 Knesset seats, needs UTJ’s 6 seats in order to preserve its majority. “We’re against sanctions and all types of other things in this law,” Litzman said. “We must reach a situation that anyone who wants to study at a religious seminary in Israel… will be able to continue studying undisturbed.” He also said his opposition to the bill will not be influenced by Yesh Atid’s support for it. “I’m sure that no one thinks or dreams that if Lapid supports this bill, we’ll support it,” Litzman said. Advertisement Lapid has argued that the legislation is close to a similar bill his party had pushed for in the past. Key differences are that the current bill does not call for criminal sanctions against students who dodge the draft — only economic penalties against the institutions where they study — and also has a lower quota for the number of ultra-Orthodox who will be drafted each year. Speaking at a faction meeting earlier Monday, Lapid stressed that his support for the bill was based on its acceptance by the Defense Ministry, and that his party would not support any changes to the proposal in committee debates ahead of its second and third Knesset readings. Responding to the Yesh Atid leader, Liberman told his own lawmakers that he “is not trying to please either Lapid or the ultra-Orthodox but the defense establishment.” He rejected possible changes to the current proposal such as removing the sanctions, saying any amendments could risk the bill being challenged by the High Court. “Everything you change opens a Pandora’s box. We will therefore only accept the law passing in its current version,” he said. The issue of ultra-Orthodox enlistment has long been a contentious one in Israel, revolving around a decades-old debate as to whether young ultra-Orthodox men studying in yeshivas should be called up for compulsory military service, like the rest of Israel’s Jewish population. In September 2017, the High Court of Justice struck down a previous law exempting ultra-Orthodox men who were engaged in religious study from military service, saying it undermined the principle of equality before the law. However, the court suspended its decision for a year, to allow for a new arrangement to be put in place, giving the government the opportunity to pass the new law by September 1, 2018.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stressed Sunday that the new IDF draft bill was at the top of the coalition's priorities. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Speaking at a Likud ministers meeting, the prime minister expressed hope both the IDF draft bill and the controversial nationality bill can be passed in the current Knesset session. "We will have a meeting with the heads of the coalition today about the draft bill," he said. "We will try to square the circle and bring this to an end as soon as possible. That is the main effort." Prime Minister Netanyahu (Photo: Gil Yohanan) The proposed legislation, which passed its first reading in the Knesset last week, includes planned cuts to the yeshivot's budgets and the use of economic incentives to pressure the Torah study institutions to encourage enlistment, but no criminal sanctions. The enlistment objectives, as stated in the proposal, are that 3,000 yeshiva students will be drafted in the first stage and 600 will volunteer for national service. These quotas are almost identical to the existing enlistment quotas that exist now. The plan will be given a two-year adaptation period, in which sanctions won’t be imposed if the yeshivot fail to meet the draft rates. In the third year, yeshivot who fail to encourage enlistment will be hit with economic sanctions if they drop below a 95-percent target. The nationality bill proposal, sponsored by MK Avi Dichter (Likud) among others, seeks to enshrine into law the status of the State of Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people. This includes legally enshrining Israel's democratic character, its state symbols, Jerusalem as the capital, Hebrew as the official language and the right of return for Diaspora Jewry. Ahead of the Cabinet meet, the Ministerial Committee for Holy Places held a discussion on the Western Wall egalitarian prayer area plan, with the prime minister, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz and a representative of the Antiquities Authority in attendance. The committee was supposed to approve the beginning of the works to expand the current mixed prayer area at Robinson's Arch, but no vote was held at the end of the meeting. Religious Services Minister David Azoulay resigned from the committee on Sunday, saying he was acting at the instructions of Shas's spiritual leader Rabbi Shalom Cohen. He said he cannot lend a hand to the construction of a "Reform Western Wall," which harms the sanctity of the holy site. Azoulay is the third to leave the committee, after chairwoman Culture Minister Miri Regev and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked.

Israel has always understood itself to be a Jewish state. But for the past five years, politicians – specifically those on the right – have been pushing for legislation that would make that fact irrefutable, strengthening their ability to incorporate the country’s Jewish national and religious character into government policy. This proposed nation-state bill would be a Basic Law, which means it would have constitutional-like status. Israel’s lack of a constitution has led to the creation of a series of such “Basic Laws,” which the courts are meant to recognize as articulating the underlying principles of the state. However, due to internal wrangling over the wording of the law, the nation-state bill has enjoyed a legislative roller-coaster ride since its original conception back in 2013. >> Attorney general warns Netanyahu of international implications if Nation-State Bill Passed ■ Intervention against apartheid law casts Rivlin as gatekeeper of Israeli democracy ■ Netanyahu to make It official: Fascism is what we are Open gallery view Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated repeatedly that the passage of such a law is one of his top priorities, and is hoping to get the bill passed before the Knesset breaks for its summer recess next week. Yet he has failed to achieve a consensus among the parties in his last two coalition governments, and Habayit Hayehudi and United Torah Judaism have both raised objections to parts of the latest version. “Israel is a Jewish and democratic state, and for the sake of creating a balance and resisting those who challenge, I am determined to advance my version of the nation-state law,” Netanyahu said in 2014, as various factions battled over different versions of the bill. “Over the years, a distinct imbalance has been created between the Jewish element and the democratic one. There is an imbalance between individual rights and national rights in Israel,” he added. From the outset, human rights organizations and political figures on the left have decried the proposed law as antidemocratic, arguing that even in its mildest version, it legitimizes giving Jews and the Jewish religion preferential treatment and denying full and equal rights to the country’s non-Jewish citizens. >> Netanyahu to make it official: Fascism is what we are Its harshest critics, meanwhile, have said the law prepares the legal ground for a one-state solution and the annexation of the West Bank. In its the most recent version, figures ranging from left-wing activists to the Israeli president have joined the battle against preventing its passage in its current form. The clause that has upset them most would explicitly allow the establishment of communities that are segregated by religion or nationality, giving discrimination an official stamp of approval.

Deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman (United Torah Judaism) said Tuesday that if the state cannot convince the High Court of Justice to postpone the expiration of the existing IDF draft law within a week, he would resign from the government. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The existing Israeli Defense Service Law expires in September after the High Court deemed it unconstitutional, and so the Knesset must pass an alternative law before then. If a new law is not passed to regulate the exemptions of ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students, tens of thousands of them are expected to receive IDF draft orders. Prime Minister Netanyahu; Deputy Health Minister Litzman (Photos: Reuters, Avi Mualem) Litzman's close associates stressed he wasn't threatening Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or the High Court, but rather acting at the instruction of his Agudat Yisrael faction's Council of Torah Sages, who determined a solution must be found before the end of the Knesset's summer session to prevent the drafting of yeshiva students. "If the matter is not resolved, meaning if we don't get a postponement from the High Court, he would not be able to remain in the government," one close associate explained.

News article:
Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday of possible implications for Israel in the international arena if the Nation-State Bill is passed in its current form. Sources confirmed to Haaretz that “the subject indeed came up” in conversation between Mendelblit and Netanyahu, but “there was no special meeting about" the legislation. Deputy Attorney General Ran Nizri also said, on Tuesday during a meeting at the Knesset, that the passage of the bill would have international ramifications, adding: “I stop here. We wear another hat. We are doing our job in closed rooms where we speak to the relevant political officials and there, more is said about the international implications.” >> Explained: The controversial bill that would allow Jewish-only communities in Israel The legislation, which would have a constitution-like status, would prioritize Jewish values over democratic ones. One controversial clause would allow the establishment of communities that are segregated by religion or nationality. The clause in the bill declares that “the state can allow a community composed of people of the same faith or nationality to maintain an exclusive community.” Eyal Zandberg from the Attorney General’s Office has said the clause “is blatant discrimination” and that “this means the residents selection committee can hang up a sign saying ‘No entry to non-Jews.’” The law would also define Hebrew as the only official language in Israel and instruct judges to look for precedents from Jewish legal rulings when Israeli law offers no guidance. In addition to damage to Israel’s democratic image, the implications might involve agreements and treaties to which Israel is a signatory, as well as international law. Meanwhile, Likud is looking into the possibility of changing the wording of one of the controversial clauses in the bill, clause 7b, which allows for the establishment of Jewish-only communities. The alternative wording is mainly declarative, and does not actually prohibit members of other ethnic groups from moving into Jewish communities. According to the alternative, the cause would read: “The State of Israel regards itself as committed to the resolution of the League of Nations, which supported dense Jewish settlement in areas under its control.” This wording was suggested by Dr. Haggai Vinitzky of the Menachem Begin Heritage Center, who presented it during a meeting at the Knesset Tuesday. Vinitzky’s wording is based on the document establishing the British Mandate in Palestine. Clause 6 of that document states that the British government would encourage dense Jewish settlement and would facilitate the immigration of Jews to areas of Palestine. The wording is expected to impede international criticism of the law. “It was clear to everyone that the wording of the original clause was very problematic, “a senior Likud official told Haaretz. “Vinitzky’s proposal solves a lot of problems, but it also makes the matter of settlement declarative rather than operative.” The major uncertainty, the official said, was “whether to continue to advance the law, which would be devoid of significant tools to ‘Judaize’ the Galilee and the Negev, and whether there was an important aspect in principle in the very legislating of a nation-state law in Israel. Netanyahu is the one who has to decide.” During the meeting it emerged that the current wording of the clause might open the door for the High Court of Justice to intervene and require equal construction for members of other religions and ethnic groups. Given that possibility, the right-wing parties decided to soften the language. The Yisrael Beiteinu party also suggested two alternative wordings Tuesday for the controversial clause. MK Oded Forer submitted the party’s objections to the bill and suggested wording similar to Vinitzky’s: “The State of Israel regards itself as obligated to establish and strengthen dense Jewish settlement in areas of the Land of Israel under its control.” Another alternative suggested by Forer was: “The State of Israel will be open to and encourage immigration of Jews and the ingathering of the exiles and will work to develop Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel.” The Knesset’s legal adviser said Forer’s suggestions were better than the wording presented by the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, which is working on the legislation, and these suggestions should be developed “to avoid the damage. It corresponds well with the Zionist ethos.” In criticizing the current wording, Forer told the committee: “What will happen in the city of Arad, when enough Gerer Hasidim move in and claim that ‘Jews who aren’t Jews according to what the Gerer Rebbe decided won’t be able to live in the city’”? Another controversial clause, 7a, would allow every person to maintain his or her culture, education, heritage, language and identity. The committee’s legal adviser, Gur Bligh, said that he could not rule out the possibility that the clause would discriminate against women based on the leeway it would give for everyone to maintain their own values.

News article:
An ultra-Orthodox cabinet minister on Tuesday threatened to quit the government unless the High Court of Justice postpones the implementation of a bill regulating mandatory military service for members of Israel’s Haredi community.

The state asked the High Court of Justice on Sunday to grant a seven-month extension on a deadline it had set for passing legislation regulating military service for members of Israel’s ultra-Orthodox community. The request came after Yaakov Litzman, deputy health minister and head of the United Torah Judaism party, said last week that he would resign from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, unless the court extends its deadline to legislate the bill. His ultra-Orthodox party cited the need for dramatic changes to the current version of the bill, which has been wending its way through the Knesset. In its application, the state noted that “this is an unusual request, submitted as a last resort against the backdrop of a sensitive issue.” Last September, the High Court ruled that a 2015 version of Israel’s draft law granting most yeshiva students draft exemptions was unconstitutional, and gave lawmakers a year to institute new guidelines for ultra-Orthodox enlistment.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Habayit Hayehudi chairman Naftali Bennett on Sunday agreed on a revised version of the controversial nation-state bill after hours of intense talks. The nation-state bill aims to legally redefine Israel’s official status as a “Jewish ‎‎state with a ‎‎democratic regime,” rather than a “Jewish and ‎‎democratic state,” as it is defined today in Israel’s basic laws. If passed, the law will require the state ‎‎to preserve ‎‎the country’s Jewish character and ‎‎protect state ‎‎symbols and sacred Jewish sites ‎‎according to Jewish ‎‎tradition. One sticking point included in the bill is a provision allowing communities to legally exclude non-Jews. The attorney general has criticized the provision as discriminatory and a violation of Israel’s basic laws, which are its de facto constitution. On Sunday, Netanyahu and Bennett agreed to modify the contentious clause to stipulate that “the state considers the development of Jewish settlement to be a national priority, and will work to encourage and strengthen it and its establishment.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories This revised version has received a green light from the attorney general’s office, as well as from key lawmakers from the Likud and Habayit Hayehudi parties. The bill was redrafted after Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit warned that the original language would be struck down as unconstitutional. It had previously said: “The state may allow a certain community, including that which comprises a single religion or ethnic group, to settle in a segregated nature.” During Sunday’s weekly cabinet meeting, Tourism Minister Yariv Levin (Likud) argued that, as a legitimate realization of the Zionist vision, the bill ensure the prioritization of Jewish communities across the country. He also said that the bill must clarify that promoting this value does not constitute discrimination or inequality. “While the bill is not perfect, we are now at a historic crossroads,” said Levin. “We have an opportunity to enshrine cardinal principles that make Zionist values once again the foundation of the state after a long time in which they have been eroded by the court.” The chief sponsor of the bill, MK Avi Dichter (Likud) echoed Levin’s sentiments, saying that “Zionism means establishing a Jewish national home for the Jewish people in the land of Israel; of course, this means Jewish settlement in the land of Israel.” “It boggles the mind to see Labor MKs being so opposed to this [bill],” he continued. “Didn’t they support one of the earlier versions of this bill? And didnt [former Labor Party leaders] David Ben-Gurion and Yigal Allon consider the settlement of Jews in the Negev and the Galilee to be sacrosanct?” A special committee was scheduled to meet on Monday to iron out additional disagreements regarding the bill before it is resubmitted to the Knesset plenum for its final two votes.

News article:
JTA — Israel is debating legislation that supporters say states the obvious. Critics, meanwhile, say the measure will divide Israeli society and damage its relationships with the rest of the democratic world, especially Jews in the United States. The premise of the so-called Nationality Law is simple: It enshrines in Israel’s quasi-constitutional Basic Law that Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people. But after that it gets more complicated. Much of the bill, sponsored by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, deals with obvious signs that Israel is a Jewish state, such as affirming the symbols on the flag and shield, setting the Hebrew calendar as the country’s official calendar, recognizing Jewish holidays and days of remembrance, and naming Jerusalem as the capital. Other parts of the law, however, have raised the hackles of segments of Israeli society and the Jewish Diaspora. These include clauses relegating Arabic to a “special” status instead of an official language, promoting the establishment of Jewish communities throughout Israel and addressing the state’s relationship with Diaspora Jewry. That the words “democracy” and “equality” do not appear once in the text have sounded alarm bells among its critics. Israel’s president, Reuven Rivlin, called the law a “weapon (for) our enemies.” Outgoing Jewish Agency head Natan Sharansky said it would end up “driving a wedge between Jews in Israel and in the Diaspora.” And thousands of Israeli protesters, Jewish and Arab, marched through Tel Aviv over the weekend to protest discriminatory aspects of the legislation. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms In the 11th hour before the Knesset was to vote on the legislation — it is expected to pass — a leader of American Jewry flew to Israel and spent nearly two days discussing the bill and criticizing it face to face with Israeli lawmakers. Jerry Silverman, president and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America, told JTA on Monday that the Nationality Law “took over the agenda” of his trip. Prior to leaving for Israel, he spoke to the major Jewish organizations about their concerns over the legislation. While he was not permitted to address the Knesset joint committee working to massage the language of the legislation before it comes to the plenum for a vote sometime this week, Silverman said he sat in on the meetings and was recognized publicly as a representative of Diaspora Jewry. He said he discussed the concerns of American Jewry with many lawmakers and key members of the Knesset, as well as the Prime Minister’s Office. Advertisement Silverman told JTA he is concerned that the legislation, with its focus on the Jewish aspects of Israel, will alienate young American Jews who are “so social-justice conscious today.” He said there are several parts of the legislation that “American Jews would struggle with.” Changing the status of the Arabic language is being seen as “discriminatory,” according to Silverman. Arabs make up about 20 percent of Israel’s population. A section stating that Israel is responsible for preserving the connection of Israel with worldwide Jewry also has drawn criticism. Critics fear it is worded in such a way as to weaken the ability of Jews in the Diaspora, and even in Israel, to promote pluralism inside the Jewish state or petition the Supreme Court in Israel to hear cases on issues that affect Diaspora Jewry, such as the establishment of the egalitarian prayer section of the Western Wall. The wording of a clause that would have allowed for the establishment of communities based on one religion or nationality was changed Sunday to instead reflect “national value in developing Jewish communities and will act to encourage, promote and establish them.” Haaretz said the clause nonetheless promotes the establishment of “Jewish-only communities.” The previous wording of the clause would have “emboldened and given a lot of fuel to the BDS movement,” Silverman said, echoing the statements of many on social media and even in the halls of the Knesset. Some, especially Arab Israelis and their supporters, have used the word “apartheid” to describe the provision. The author of the original Nationality Law nearly a decade ago — Avraham Diskin, a political scientist and Hebrew University professor — rejects criticism of the legislation, which he calls “declarative” and “without a lot of practical” consequences. Advertisement Diskin told JTA that it is “high time” for a Basic Law that specifically identifies Israel as a Jewish state, in addition to the many Israeli laws that mention Judaism and the Jewish character of the state. There are “many people around the world outside of Israel, mainly Arabs, who are not ready to accept allowing the Jews to have their own nation state,” Diskin said. He added that in Israel, some challenge the notion of Israel as a Jewish state — Jews among them. Diskin said the law is most needed, however, because of the Israeli Supreme Court. He and other critics of the high court say it has ignored the Jewishness of the state, for example in cases of Palestinian residency rights in Israel, rights of foreign converts to citizenship, land purchases by the Jewish National Fund, draft deferments to haredi Orthodox youth and the deportation of illegal migrants. Israel’s Declaration of Independence repeatedly notes the connections of the Jews to Israel and that Israel is being established as the nation-state of the Jewish people. Unlike the Basic Law, however, the Declaration of Independence is not a legal document. Diskin said there is nothing in the legislation that violates human rights or the rights of minorities. Amir Fuchs, a researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute, said the legislation resembles the preamble of an as-yet unwritten Constitution, and that “there is no [democratic] country in the world that has not specifically enumerated the right of equality in its constitution.” The legislation has “no clear statement that the state will have equal rights for all its citizens,” he told JTA. “This is what is missing. This is the problem,” Fuchs said. He acknowledged that other Basic Laws deal with Israel’s democratic nature and individual rights, including the one on human dignity and liberty. At least two other Basic Laws refer to Israel as both Jewish and democratic. Advertisement Fuchs, who heads the Defending Democratic Values Program at the Israel Democracy Institute, said there is no need for the new legislation since it is clear that Israel is a Jewish nation-state based on its symbols, language and holidays, among other things. He said he does not oppose the idea of a law stating that Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people, but that such a law should also ensure that the state will have equal rights for all its citizens. But Fuchs does not believe that Israel will look substantially different after the passage of the legislation and disagrees with those who say it will turn the country into an apartheid state. The tipping point, he said, will be in close Supreme Court decisions, where the “Jewish” element could take precedence over the “democratic”element. The legislation is set to come up for a final vote before the end of the Knesset’s summer session on Sunday. The coalition has enough votes for passage because the haredi Orthodox parties are willing to support it. The haredi parties in the past have opposed the legislation due to its nationalist nature. But the addition of the word “religious” to a clause on the right to self-determination in part softened their stance. Silverman said that as a sovereign state, Israel has the right to pass such legislation. The Israeli and the American Jewish community are “pretty young environments for the two major Jewish communities in the world. And we are both going through growing pains.” Jewish organizations in the United States will be watching to see how the law is applied practically, particularly in cases involving Diaspora Jewry. “Israel has to be the nation-state for all Jews,” Silverman said. “That cannot be limited in any way.”

The Knesset on Tuesday rescinded legislation which gave the prime minister the authority to declare war upon consulting only the defense minister and not via a full cabinet vote. The cancellation of the clause passed its second and third readings with 77 MKs in favor and 16 against. The vote came amid heightened tensions on the border between Israel and Gaza, with many concerned that the recent uptick in violence could lead to a war. The Knesset passed legislation in April that included a controversial clause allowing the prime minister and defense minister to declare war or order a major military operation likely to lead to war, without requiring a full cabinet vote. Opposition MKs said at the time that the language of the law effectively gave free rein to the prime minister by removing all oversight. Even some political hawks were troubled by the legislation. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms MK Ofer Shelah of the Yesh Atid party hailed Tuesday’s vote, saying that it was “inconceivable that a decision to go to war could be in the hands of one person, without consultation with cabinet members.” Shelah added that if the amendment had not been approved, there would have “undoubtedly been a commission of inquiry in the future.” According to the now-canceled clause, in “extreme circumstances,” military operations could be authorized by the prime minister and defense minister alone and will not require a vote by cabinet ministers. The law did not specify exactly what those circumstances may be, or who would determine them, saying only that it would apply “if the issue is necessary due to urgency.” Advertisement The cabinet reportedly accepted that the legislation was too extreme and far-reaching, following criticism and concerns it may be struck down by the High Court. “It is appropriate that a decision of the Ministerial Committee regarding starting a war or taking significant military action that may at a high level of certainty lead to war be adopted by as wide a panel as possible,” the amendment rescinding the clause said. Some eight years ago, Netanyahu and then-defense minister Ehud Barak instructed the chief of staff and head of the Mossad intelligence service to put the army into a state of readiness, only to be told by the latter two that the specified activity was illegal because it had not been properly approved and could lead to war. There have, however, been numerous occasions where decisions of a similar nature have been taken by the security cabinet, a smaller forum of ministers tasked with forming policy regarding war and peace, or other smaller forums of ministers.

News article:
Tel Aviv: A bill enshrining Israel’s ‘Jewish character’ in law is heading into its final stretch after years of debate, over the objections of civil-rights organisations and opposition leaders who say it discriminates against the country’s Arab minority. The bill was expected to be brought to a parliamentary committee vote this week, after a provision that could have blocked Arabs and Jews from living in each other’s communities was excised. Detractors say the bill’s definition of the country as the Jewish national home is unfair to Arab citizens, who make up about 20 per cent of the population. The bill “is very important to guaranteeing the essence of our existence, and we must pass it soon”, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday at a meeting of his Likud party’s parliamentary faction, according to the Ynet website. The bill’s supporters want to bring it for a full Knesset vote before the parliament breaks for summer recess next week. If passed, it would become Israel’s 12th Basic Law — the country’s equivalent of a constitution — though it likely would face court challenges. Israeli regime leaders have argued for years that the state’s Jewish identity needs to be anchored in a specific law, not just in the Declaration of Independence. Nearly all Zionist political parties support formally defining Israel as a Jewish and democratic state, and the flag, national anthem and other symbols emphasise Judaism. The bill “sticks a finger in the eyes of a fifth of the citizens, deliberately creating conflict among people to earn a bit more political capital for the Netanyahu tyranny,” Ayman Odeh, head of the Joint List, an alliance of Arab-dominated parties in Israel’s parliament, wrote on Twitter. Passing a bill strengthening the national characteristics of the state, without clearly anchoring the principle of equality for all citizens, could erode the Israeli regime’s democratic nature, said Amir Fuchs, a researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute. He said it was problematic that the bill demotes Arabic from its status as an official national language, instead granting it a “special standing” and mandating that Arab citizens continue to have access to state services in their native tongue. The legislation also could anger Palestinian officials, who don’t accept Israel as the Jewish state and reject the notion that Jews constitute a people entitled to self-determination. Palestinians also fear the bill could block their demand that Arab refugees from the 1948 Middle East war, and their millions of descendants, be granted a “right of return” to Israel. The bill declares occupied Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital, a characterisation opposed by Palestinians, who claim the city’s eastern sector for themselves. The Palestinian National Authority broke off ties with Washington after the Trump administration recognised occupied Jerusalem as Israel’s capital last December.

Reactions to the Knesset’s passage overnight Wednesday of the new Jewish State law were predictably divided along party lines, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailing it as “a pivotal moment in the annals of Zionism and the State of Israel.” Lawmakers approved the law, which enshrines Israel as “the national home of the Jewish people” in the country’s quasi-constitutional Basic Laws, in its second and third readings, with 62 voting in favor, 55 opposed and two abstaining, after hours of heated debate in the Knesset chamber. While the coalition feted the passage of the law, members of the opposition decried it as nationalistic, divisive and a threat to democracy. “We enshrined in law the basic principle of our existence,” said Netanyahu. “Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people, which respects the individual rights of all its citizens. This is our state — the Jewish state. In recent years there have been some who have attempted to put this in doubt, to undercut the core of our being. Today we made it law: This is our nation, language and flag.” The law’s main proponent over the past few years, former Shin Bet head Avi Dichter, said it was a response to anyone in Israel who believes Jewish presence is temporary — referencing Arab MK Jamal Zahalka’s past claim that Arabs will outlast Jews in the country. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “All you can be is an equal minority, not an equal nationality,” Dichter said. Dichter asserted, “Contrary to the disinformation and fake news that have flooded [the conversation], the Basic Law does not hurt Israel’s minority cultures.” He also claimed it does not detract from the status of the Arabic language. One clause in the law downgrades Arabic from an official language to one of “special” standing, though it also says that “this clause does not harm the status given to the Arabic language before this law came into effect.” Advertisement Read the full text of the law here. Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein was also celebratory, saying “history” had been made in the plenum, and calling the new legislation “one of the most important laws ever to be passed by the Knesset.” Tourism Minister Yariv Levin condemned the opposition to the law by the Zionist Union faction, and particularly the Labor party, its chief component. “Tell us honestly, Labor members: Do you contest the Jewish people’s right to the Land of Israel? Is it not our nation state? Is its flag not acceptable to you?

Lawmakers amended the bill accordingly just hours before the final authorization, removing the clause sanctioning housing discrimination on the basis of ethnicity or religion. Some of the last-minute changes to the bill came after politicians, legal advisers and others warned that several of its clauses were discriminatory and could cast a dark shadow over Israel in the international arena. Judaism is already mentioned throughout the country’s laws, and religious authorities control many aspects of life, including marriage. But the 11 existing Basic Laws deal mostly with state institutions like the Knesset, the courts, and the presidency, while Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty defines Israel’s democratic character.

Reactions to the Knesset’s passage overnight Wednesday of the new Jewish State law were predictably divided along party lines, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailing it as “a pivotal moment in the annals of Zionism and the State of Israel.” Lawmakers approved the law, which enshrines Israel as “the national home of the Jewish people” in the country’s quasi-constitutional Basic Laws, in its second and third readings, with 62 voting in favor, 55 opposed and two abstaining, after hours of heated debate in the Knesset chamber. While the coalition feted the passage of the law, members of the opposition decried it as nationalistic, divisive and a threat to democracy. “We enshrined in law the basic principle of our existence,” said Netanyahu. “Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people, which respects the individual rights of all its citizens. This is our state — the Jewish state. In recent years there have been some who have attempted to put this in doubt, to undercut the core of our being. Today we made it law: This is our nation, language and flag.” The law’s main proponent over the past few years, former Shin Bet head Avi Dichter, said it was a response to anyone in Israel who believes Jewish presence is temporary — referencing Arab MK Jamal Zahalka’s past claim that Arabs will outlast Jews in the country. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “All you can be is an equal minority, not an equal nationality,” Dichter said. Dichter asserted, “Contrary to the disinformation and fake news that have flooded [the conversation], the Basic Law does not hurt Israel’s minority cultures.” He also claimed it does not detract from the status of the Arabic language. One clause in the law downgrades Arabic from an official language to one of “special” standing, though it also says that “this clause does not harm the status given to the Arabic language before this law came into effect.” Advertisement Read the full text of the law here. Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein was also celebratory, saying “history” had been made in the plenum, and calling the new legislation “one of the most important laws ever to be passed by the Knesset.” Tourism Minister Yariv Levin condemned the opposition to the law by the Zionist Union faction, and particularly the Labor party, its chief component. “Tell us honestly, Labor members: Do you contest the Jewish people’s right to the Land of Israel? Is it not our nation state? Is its flag not acceptable to you? There has never been such a rejection by the Labor movement of Zionist values.” Critics have said that the law is discriminatory to Israel’s Arab and other minority populations. and needlessly provokes those minorities by underlining a preferential attitude toward Judaism.

"Similar to a constitution, the basic laws underpin Israel's legal system and are more difficult to repeal than regular laws", The Times of Israel reported, adding that the law also declares that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, sets the Hebrew calendar as the official calendar of the state and recognizes all Jewish holidays. The most furious protests during the debate reportedly came from Arab lawmakers. According to the Times of Israel, Joint (Arab) List MK Jamal Zahalka ripped a printed text of the bill to shreds from the podium. "I declare with astonishment and sorrow the death of democracy… The funeral will take place today in the plenum," his fellow party member Ahmad Tibi was quoted as saying by The Times of Israel. Arabs make up a fifth of the country’s eight-million-strong population and have frequently accused the government of discrimination, including against Palestinian refugees, millions of whom have been trying to return to their ancestral homes after being banished during the creation of Israel.

News article:
The passage of the Nation-State Bill early Thursday morning, aimed at boosting Israel’s Jewish character, officially codifies and clarifies the facilitation of the prophetic ingathering and protecting of the Jewish people, says Yishai Fleisher, an Israeli radio broadcaster and international spokesman for the Jewish community in Hebron. The legislation, he said, “helps promote and promulgate Jewish ancient culture including the calander and language of the Bible.” The passage of this legislation comes on the heels of the United States moving its embassy to Israel’s capital, Jerusalem, followed closely by Guatemala. And other countries considering moving their embassies include Slovakia, Russia – the largest country in the world, and Brazil, the most populous South American state. With a majority of the world’s Jews currently living in Israel and now a government enshrining the Jewish character of the country, many say that we are living in momentous times. The bill had recently made worldwide headlines as the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee headed by Likud MK Amir Ohana met to discuss the Nation-State Bill on July 10, receiving widespread criticism, including from the President of Israel Reuven Rivlin and Natan Sharansky, outgoing Jewish Agency chairman. After hours of debate, the bill was passed with 62 in favor, 55 opposed, and two abstaining. Basic Law informs Israel’s legal system, much like a Constitution, and is more difficult to repeal than ordinary law. Up until now, Israel’s Basic Laws relate to state institutions and democratic character rather than its Jewish national identity. Sections already enshrined in ordinary law include the Law of Return (Jewish immigration), the name of the state, state symbols (the flag and national anthem), the Jerusalem Law, the calendar, national holidays and the Sabbath. A new clause in the bill that has received many critiques allows Israel to “authorize a community composed of people having the same faith and nationality to maintain the exclusive character of that community.” The Nation-State bill was first submitted in 2009-2010 by various Knesset members including the Kadima party’s Avi Dichter, who had sourced the idea from the Institute for Zionist Strategies, an Israeli policy and research think tank with the goal of preserving Israel as “a viable, democratic Jewish state.” Proponents of the legislation argue that Israel has been forgoing its Jewish nature for its democratic nature, and it is time that the two are put on equal footing – or with its Jewish identity eclipsing its democratic identity. Fleisher told Breaking Israel News, “In a lot of ways this bill is what you would have thought Israel is anyway – which is that Israel is the Nation-State of the Jewish people. The Nation-State bill is nothing but a redefinition of Israel’s Declaration of Independence, which sets out so clearly what is Israel’s goal.” Fleisher views Israel’s Jewish identity and democracy as conflicting values, one from ancient Judea and one from the western Greek empire. Israel, as the only Jewish State, should prioritize its Jewish identity, Fleisher said. “One of the great mistakes has been that we’ve promoted Israel as Jewish and democratic as if these two values are equal.” He related that while democracy may have beautiful values, “democracy is a Greek word – it reflects Greek values and it’s very hard to make those two very different systems of thought to be co-equal.” “To me, it was always obvious that Israel is a state whose job is to protect the Jewish people first and second, to be an incubator for Jewish values and culture and third to be a country that is a light unto the nations.” But legislation dissidents claim that Israel should be committed to full equality for all citizens, including minorities, and view Israel’s Declaration of Independence as enshrining democracy. Dr. Amir Fuchs, Head of the Defending Democratic Values Program at the Israel Democracy Institute told Breaking Israel News, “The initial clause that determines that Israel is a nation-state and has the right to self-determination [is a new principle]. This is anchored in the Declaration of Independence, but it is not currently written in any Basic Law except for the definition of “Jewish and democratic.” In contrast, he said, the proposed bill states that Israel is the national home of the Jewish people without ensuring the principle of equality for all its citizens, as defined in the Declaration of Independence. “This creates an imbalance between the Jewish and democratic values,” he maintained, adding, “Arabic is demoted from an official language of the state to a language that enjoys special status.” But Fleisher maintained that while Israel has and will guarantee civil rights to minorities, it should not guarantee national rights. “Nobody is taking away the civil rights of other people. Israel is in a neighborhood of 400 million Arabs that live in 22 Arab States, not to mention millions more Muslims in Iran and Turkey. They have these states mostly set up as ethnic and religious states and we have this one little state that’s here to be a protector of the Jews, a source of autonomy in their region.” He continued, “Israel is not here to create an Arab democracy or promote other people’s values or put everyone on equal footing. It’s here to promote a group of people who need protection in this world and need to have a place to have their culture grow and succeed.” According to Sharansky, this revocation would serve the BDS movements’ critiques of Israel. Likewise, Rivlin voiced his concern that the legislation could “harm the Jewish people worldwide and in Israel, and could even be used as a weapon by our enemies.” Pnina Tamano-Shatta, an Ethiopian member of Knesset in Yesh Atid also argued BDS would “celebrate” the law. Jewish diaspora leaders have agreed, including president of the Union of Reform Judaism Rabbi Rick Jacobs who said the law would give Israel’s enemies “more fodder” and “weaken the case we make for Israel every day across America.” Fuchs continued, “The bill was recently amended to state that Israel must work only “in the Diaspora” to nurture a relationship with diaspora Jewry. This means that Israel does not need to do such work within the country itself. This was a capitulation to the ultra-Orthodox parties, who were afraid that the bill would be interpreted as requiring Israel to recognize the non-Orthodox religious streams in Judaism.” Likewise, stated Sharansky, “While the nation-state law was originally intended to reinforce this principle, the most recent amendments to it are of great concern because they drive a wedge between Jews in Israel and in the Diaspora.” But Fleisher argued, “before this law, BDS seeks to destroy Israel and after this law, BDS will seek to destroy Israel” and “only if one perceives Israel as a non-Jewish American-style state would the bill drive a wedge between the Jewish State and the Diaspora.” He added, “Jewish Americans sometimes make the mistake in thinking that most states in the world are like America, but most states in the world are ethnic states that are there to first and foremost promote their own ethnicity – think Japan, Iceland, Slovakia, Czechia and Hungary – what do you think their national languages and cultures are? It’s obvious. They promote their own language and culture to help it flourish and grow. These things are obvious but when it comes to Israel there are forces trying to rip it down.” Fuchs suggested that a clause should be included in the bill stating that the State of Israel is fully committed to equality for all its citizens, in particular to its minorities. “It would be appropriate to mention the Arab minority as a large minority in Israel and to note that the state is obligated their integration and inclusion in the state – as written in the Declaration of Independence,” he related.

News article:
Members of the Israeli anti-miscegenation group Lehava protest against the marriage of a Palestinian man and an Israeli Jewish woman in Rishon Letzion, 17 August 2014. Yotam Ronen ActiveStills The Israeli government has long funded various efforts to try to prevent romantic relationships between Jews and non-Jews, both inside territories it controls and around the world. But a new program confirmed this month by the tourism ministry takes Israel’s war on families of mixed religion or ethnicity to a new level. Israeli media reported on 10 July that in 2019, the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will fund trips to the country for foreign Jews, with the express objective of participating in singles mixers on and around Tu B’Av, a day celebrated by some as the “Jewish Valentine’s Day.” “Over the course of the events, young Jewish-Israelis and Jews that live in the diaspora will get to know one another, and that is likely to lead to couples forming,” predicted Israel Hayom, the pro-Netanyahu newspaper owned by casino billionaire, Republican financier and anti-Palestinian donor Sheldon Adelson. “We’ll return to the glory days,” ruling Likud Party lawmaker Sharren Haskel told the paper. “Young [Jewish] men and women from all over the world will arrive and form relationships with local young men and women, in order to prevent assimilation and strengthen the connection to Judaism.” Haskel used a Hebrew word that literally translates as “assimilation,” but that in modern Hebrew is commonly used as a euphemism for miscegenation – romantic relationships and procreation between Jews and non-Jews. Haskel recently toured the al-Aqsa mosque compound along with Uri Ariel, a cabinet minister and leading figure in the Jewish extremist movement that supports the destruction of the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa mosque in order to replace them with a Jewish temple. Israeli governments past and present have spent enormous sums subsidizing trips to the country for young Jews from abroad. Between 2010 and 2015 alone, the government gave more than $250 million to the largest provider of such trips, Birthright Israel. Adelson himself donated $40 million to Birthright in 2015. “Free sex vacation to Israel” The primary purpose of the program is fostering Zionist commitment and eventual emigration by young Jews, but the trips also aim to encourage young Jews to have sexual relations with one another, hoping this will sour them on romantic relationships with non-Jewish people back in their home countries. Birthright’s promotion of relationships between tour participants – and between participants and Israeli tour staff – is not explicitly cited in its official publications. But it is nonetheless widely acknowledged. In April, Birthright participants told Sarah Seltzer, a reporter with The Investigative Fund, about how “the combination of hook-up pressure, spring-break partying and romanticization of planned encounters between Israeli soldiers and American women” creates “a pervasive environment of sexual pressure that encourages Jews to meet, marry and, someday, procreate with other Jews.” In the experience of one young woman profiled by Seltzer, that pressure contributed to an alleged sexual assault perpetrated against her during a Birthright trip by an Israeli soldier. A writer for Vice who went on Birthright called it a “free sex vacation to Israel” and an “all-expenses-paid orgy in the desert,” sponsored by the Israeli government in the hope that “young Semites will meet, marry and procreate, yielding little mini Jews.” Other have also mocked the trips for sponsoring “22-year-olds to go to the Middle East, get totally drunk and have sex with everyone.” And in 2013, Birthright benefactor Sheldon Adelson himself told an assembled audience of young participants: “I hope you’ve all been doing the hanky-panky.” Dispensing with the pretense But the new Tu B’Av trips promoted by Haskel dispense with pretense: the initiative’s authors openly admit that their main objective is to encourage Jews to form romantic relationships with other Jews and to steer clear of non-Jews. Israel Hayom reported that the trips would include “wine tastings and camping in vineyards across the country,” to which local Israeli Jews would also be invited. The mixers will feature singing and dancing events dubbed “Returning to the Palmach and the Irgun” – a reference to two Zionist militias that participated in the 1948 Nakba, the ethnic cleansing of more than 750,000 Palestinians. The Irgun is particularly notorious for the massacre of Palestinian civilians in the village of Deir Yassin in 1948 and for the bombing of the King David Hotel two years earlier. Israel Hayom does not say how organizers would ensure that attendance would be restricted to Jews, and forbidden to Palestinian citizens of Israel, African refugees and other non-Jewish single men and women. However, given the highly segregated reality within Israel, this should not be difficult. No mixed marriages Israeli law records religious designations for each of its citizens and it does not permit couples registered under different religions to legally marry one another. The state does, however, retroactively recognize wedding ceremonies performed for such couples in other countries. Statisticians estimate that as many as one in 10 marriages in Israel are between persons from different groups. However, non-Jewish spouses – especially if they are from African states – often face deliberate obstacles from the government to their entry or residency. In recent years, Israeli government attacks on mixed relationships, within Israel and without, have been led by the far-right Jewish Home party and its leader Naftali Bennett. During Bennett’s time as education minister, Israel has stripped from its recommended reading lists for high school students books about mixed relationships. In 2015, it removed Borderlife, about a romance between a Jewish woman and a Palestinian man, and in 2016, it removed Trumpet in the Wadi, about a romance between a Jewish man and a Palestinian woman. Bennett’s education ministry also funds groups of religious Jews to move into the few mixed neighborhoods that still exist in the country – where Jews and Palestinians live alongside one another as unequal citizens, but in relative coexistence. There, the new arrivals incite against local mixed families and have distributed leaflets warning that “there are mixed marriages in almost every building in Jaffa” and exhorting residents to “strengthen Jewish identity.” Groups like Lehava recruit teens and adults to patrol Israeli towns and public beaches, where they harass mixed couples. They also protest Jewish-Palestinian wedding ceremonies with chants of “Death to the Arabs!” In 2014, three Lehava members torched the only school in the Jerusalem area with instruction in both Hebrew and Arabic, daubing the walls with slogans including “End miscegenation” and “No coexistence with cancer.” The three received sentences of about three years in prison. Fighting mixed marriages abroad In his other role as minister of diaspora affairs, Bennett funnels money to programs aimed at stamping out relationships between Jews and non-Jews overseas as well. When Bennett took over the diaspora affairs ministry in 2013, its budget from the government was about $8 million a year. Now Bennett is talking about spending $1 billion annually on projects around the world described as promoting “the future of the Jewish people.” In June 2016, Bennett told a committee of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, that the marriage of Jews to non-Jews in modern times is a disaster on par with four other tragedies of Jewish history, including the Nazi Holocaust. Five months later, two young Israelis beat to death Sudanese asylum-seeker Babikir Adham-Uvdo in a Tel Aviv suburb. Angered that a non-Jewish Black man had stopped to talk to a group of young Israeli Jewish women, the killers crushed his face so badly that his own brother was unable to recognize him. In February, one of Adham-Uvdo’s killers received a maximum jail sentence of 10 years for manslaughter, in a plea bargain, although he will probably be released in just a few years. Sentencing of the other killer, a minor at the time of the incident, has yet to be determined. “A plague” Trying to win political points by bashing mixed relationships is not exclusive to right-wing parties in Israel. In a televised interview in Hebrew in June, Isaac Herzog, the former leader of Israel’s ostensibly left-wing Zionist Union and Labor parties, called mixed families “a plague” for which he hoped to find “a solution.” VIDEO now with English subtitles: On the day he is named Jewish Agency chair, Isaac Herzog – Israel's "Leader of the Opposition" for the last 5 years – slams romantic relationships between Jews and non-Jews in the USA as “an actual plague” for which he hopes to find "a solution" pic.twitter.com/NQMMOdUtSi — David Sheen (@davidsheen) June 25, 2018 On the same day, Herzog also headed to Jerusalem to pay his respects to Israel’s Sephardic Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef – a powerful religious official with a long history of racist statements. There, Israeli media reported, Herzog thanked Yosef for his personal blessing, which included an instruction to “defend the Jewish people from assimilation.” David Sheen is an independent writer and filmmaker.

News article:
Contributing Columnist Dany Bahar July 24, 2018 It is time for the Jewish Diaspora to update some of its favorite lines for advocating on behalf of Israel. For example, “Arabic is one of Israel’s two official languages” is now a factually incorrect statement after Israel’s new Nation-State bill was passed by the Knesset last week. The bill downgraded Arabic from an official language to having “special status.” More broadly, the bill defines Israel as the national homeland of the Jewish people without mentioning the equality of all its citizens anywhere in the law. So much for the only democracy in the Middle East. Another catchy Hasbara talking point refers to Israel’s full freedom of religion. This, too, is outdated, after Rabbi Dov Haiyun was taken from his home at 5 a.m. and detained by police for performing weddings outside the auspices of the state-run Chief Rabbinate. Moreover, proudly referring to Israel as a country with full freedom of expression is nowadays, likely, an inaccurate statement, after Meyer Koplow, chair of Brandeis University’s board of trustees, was questioned on his way out of Ben-Gurion Airport over a Palestinian brochure in his luggage. The nature of the interrogation was not about him posing a security threat, but rather about his political positions. Last week also saw the erosion of one of Israel’s biggest achievements — equal rights for the LGBTQ community — which were attacked by the government coalition last week when it voted against a clause that would allow surrogate births for same-sex couples. It was a bad week for Israeli democracy, to say the least. But it was also not surprising. The weakening of Israel’s democracy is a trend that has been happening for a while now. A recent report by the V-Dem institute downgraded Israel from being a “Liberal Democracy” in 2007 to an “Electoral Democracy” in 2017, as a result of a weakening of the legislative and judicial oversight of the executive and the deterioration of protection of individual liberties and minorities. Like a cancer, the deterioration of democracy is spreading through the different institutions that, since the foundation of the state, have guaranteed the existing (and unique) balance of Israel as a democracy and a homeland to the Jewish people. For instance, it is more and more common for Arab representatives in the Knesset, who represent the largest minority in the country, to be disqualified in one way or another. And in 2016, a bill was introduced enabling their suspension from their elected positions if a qualified majority of their fellow parliamentarians decide so. More recently, a conference on the occupation held at the Knesset — organized by several opposition MKs — was disrupted and severely condemned by members of the government, some of them describing the conference organizers as a “fifth column.” Similarly, the government, through Minister of Justice Ayelet Shaked, has engaged in a battle to “change the face of the Supreme Court” as “part of a process of returning the court to its basic function: interpreting the norms that parliament decides, not replacing it.” Esther Hayut, Israel’s Supreme Court President, reacted to a bill limiting the power of the High Court of Justice by saying that Israel’s Judiciary is “under unprecedented attack” and that the bill threatens the human rights of every individual in Israeli society. Some important institutions of civil society have endured constant attacks by the government. For instance, Minister of Culture Miri Regev — a close political ally of Netanyahu — has made government funding to cultural institutions conditional on political stances. Recently, she responded to a funding request by the well-regarded Israel Museum by insisting the cash be used to pay for an extravagant fundraising gala, with Sara Netanyahu as the guest of honor. In parallel, the press has also been under constant attack by Prime Minister Netanyahu himself, who has on several occasions dubbed Israeli media outlets as “fake news.” This has only intensified with the media reporting the ongoing investigations against Netanyahu and his wife on open corruption cases. In 2017 Freedom House ranked Israel 33 out of 100 in terms of freedom of the press. The only significant establishment of the state apparatus that has been, so long, untouched is the defense establishment (whose recommendations very often contradict the current government’s political philosophy). It would come as no surprise were they to be the next ones attacked for their professionalism. On almost every front, Israeli democracy is under attack. Those Israelis who are fighting for democracy — hopefully a majority — cannot do it alone. They need the help of all Jews around the world who believe Israel’s democratic character is an essential part of it. This attack is, perhaps, the most important threat to the future of Israel as it was envisioned by its founders and all the Jewish people. Thus, maybe the best course of action for Jews in the Diaspora is not to worry about updating or replacing now-outdated Hasbara lines, but rather, to be first to acknowledge this systematic attack on Israel’s democracy, ironically led by its own government. We cannot keep defending the indefensible. It is time for Jews in the Diaspora who love Israel to confront Netanyahu and his government for slowly destroying Israel’s democracy. The future of Israel depends on it. Dany Bahar is an Israeli and Venezuelan economist. He is currently a David M.

News article:
The Israeli Knesset passed a landmark piece of legislation that enshrines the State of Israel as “the national home of the Jewish people.” The “Jewish Nation-State Law” officially declares that Israel is both a Jewish and democratic state, protecting the right of the Jewish people to exercise self-determination. On the day of its passage, J Street tweeted that the bill “was born in sin.” The so-called “progressive” lobbying group would go on to claim that “its only purpose is to send a message to the Arab community, the LGBT community and other minorities in Israel, that they are not and never will be equal citizens.” {mosads}Contrary to J Street’s assertions, this law does not violate the civil rights of non-Jewish Israeli citizens. Prof. Eugene Kontorovich of the Kohelet Policy Forum explains that there is nothing undemocratic about this legislation and that it is quite commonplace among Western democracies. “The law does not infringe on the individual rights of any Israeli citizen, including Arabs; nor does it create individual privileges,” writes Prof. Kontorovich. “The illiberalism here lies with the law’s critics, who would deny the Jewish state the freedom to legislate like a normal country.” In the European Union alone, at least seven countries have similar constitutional provisions that define nationhood as it applies to their respective contexts. A major difference is that Israel’s Declaration of Independence ensures complete social and political rights “to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.” Israel is undoubtedly the best place in the region for its Arab citizens to practice their religion and lead prosperous lives. The Jewish state is home to over 400 mosques, a fivefold increase since 1988. The Israeli government also provides the salaries of approximately 300 imams and muezzins, as well as funding for Islamic schools and colleges throughout the country. In Israel’s capital city of Jerusalem, only Muslims are legally allowed to pray on the Temple Mount in order not to offend Islamic sensibilities. Despite the Temple Mount being Judaism’s holiest place, the site is managed by an Islamic religious committee (waqf) with a history of destroying priceless Jewish artifacts unearthed at the site. The Jewish state displays more respect for the civil rights of its Muslim citizens than they receive in Saudi Arabia, the most Islamic country in the world. According to the U.K.-based Islamic Heritage Research Foundation, over 90 percent of Saudi Arabia’s historical and religious sites have been destroyed since 1985. A Hilton hotel now stands on the site of Islam’s first caliph, while the house of Muhammad’s first wife has been turned into a block of toilets. Throughout the Middle East, Islamic persecution against Christians has resulted in the population plunging from 14 percent in 1910 to less than 4 percent today. Yet since Israel declared independence in 1948, its Christian population increased over five-fold. Compared to any other religious group in Israel, the Christian minority fares the best in terms of education and can be found in every facet of Israeli life. Yet in the neighboring Palestinian-controlled territories, ethnic cleansing and persecution have reduced the Christian population from 15 percent of the population to less than 1.3 percent today. It is also absurd for J Street to accuse Israel of marginalizing its LGBT minority when Israel grants asylum and permanent residency to hundreds of gay Palestinians fleeing persecution. On university campuses across the U.S., J Street supports groups that promote BDS, the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, some of which openly call for Israel’s destruction. J Street co-founder Daniel Levy put it this way: “There’s no reason a Palestinian should think there was justice in the creation of Israel.” Unless a cure is found for J Street’s anti-Israel derangement syndrome, this organization cannot possibly be considered pro-Israel, pro-peace… or even pro-progressive.

News article:
Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon said Thursday that a recently passed controversial law defining Israel as the Jewish nation-state was a mistake that needs to be corrected, as was another law denying gay men from the right to use surrogacy to father children. He became the second minister in as many days to suggest tailoring the nation-state law in order to maintain equal rights for Israel’s Druze community, which has condemned the legislation. Kahlon spoke to Army Radio ahead of a planned meeting later in the day hosted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which will look at altering the Jewish nation-state law due to the Druze outcry. “The legislation was done hastily,” Kahlon said of the bill, passed last week, which his Kulanu party, as a member of the coalition, voted in favor of. “We made a mistake and we need to fix it.” The nation-state law, proponents say, puts Jewish values and democratic values on equal footing. Critics, however, say the law effectively discriminates against Israel’s Arabs and other minority communities.

Kahlon indicated that commitments to coalition agreements played a significant role in gaining support for the bill, rather than ideology. The minister added that a Druze lawmaker from Kulanu, who joined two other Druze MKs and community leaders in filing a High Court of Justice petition against the law, was acting on his own accord. Advertisement Kahlon said that MK Akram Hasson told him of his plans to contest the law, and that the minister gave him his blessing to act as he felt best. Hasson, Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman, Communications Minister Ayoub Kara — the sole Druze minister in the cabinet — and Yisrael Beytenu party MK Hamad Amar were all to participate in the meeting with Netanyahu, Kahlon said. MK Benny Begin, of the ruling Likud party, on Thursday urged that the existing legislation should not be canceled but rather amended to stipulate that all Israeli citizens have full equal rights, the Kan broadcaster reported. Netanyahu will not consider amending the law, however, Hebrew media sources reported. Even so, Netanyahu was open to “other moves aimed at improving conditions for the Druze,” according to the reports. Environmental Protection Minister Ze’ev Elkin, one of the bill’s original sponsors and a Netanyahu confidant, rejected Kahlon’s statement. “I don’t think we made a mistake,” Elkin said, according to the Israel Hayom daily. “The law is correct, and the text is correct and reached a balance. In the end, everyone agreed to it, and it returned sanity to the country that we can proudly say that we are a Jewish state. The law doesn’t impact the individual rights of anyone.” Advertisement On Wednesday Education Minister Naftali Bennett vowed to work to “heal the wound” the law has inflicted on the Druze community. Sources close to Bennett told The Times of Israel that the Jewish Home leader was open to amending the nation-state law. In addition to changing the nation-state law, Kahlon said Thursday, he was working with Kulanu MK Merav Ben Ari to change another controversial law passed last week which expanded surrogacy regulations, but excluded gay men from access to surrogate parenthood. “We understood there is a problem,” Kahlon said. There was a wide outcry against the surrogacy law along with a one-day strike called by the LGBT community on Sunday and a mass protest in Tel Aviv the night before attended by some 100,000 people. Noting that government stability is being challenged with several contentious items of legislation, among them the nation-state law, gay surrogacy rights, and military service for members of the ultra-Orthodox, Kahlon told Army Radio he expects there to be early elections called in February or March of next year instead of at the end of the year.

Why Israel’s Nation-State Law Matters BY: David Isaac https://freebeacon.com/blog/israels-nation-state-law-matters/ On Tuesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared that the “spirit of Hitler has been revived, Israel is the most fascist and racist state.” He then called on—well, everybody—”to work against Israel.” What sent Erdogan into orbit was Israel’s newly minted Nation-State Law, which passed last week by a vote of 62 to 55 after a boisterous Knesset debate lasting over eight hours. The law declares the Land of Israel is the Jewish people’s historic homeland. It identifies symbols of the state—the flag with its Star of David, the menorah, the national anthem Hatikvah (“the Hope”). It codifies certain official holidays like the Sabbath, recognizes Hebrew as the official language and proclaims encouragement for Jewish immigration and Jewish settlement. Much of this sounds ho-hum. The law in good part is a reprise of Israel’s Declaration of Independence, which proclaims that it is the “natural right of the Jewish people to be masters of their own fate, like all other nations, in their own sovereign State.” Nevertheless, the Nation-State Law is significant: 1) It gives the 1948 declaration the force of law. As the first president of Israel’s Supreme Court said: “The Declaration expresses the vision and credo of the people; but it is not a constitutional law making a practical ruling on the upholding or nullification of various ordinances and statutes.” For many years, Israeli legal scholars have called for turning the Declaration into a Basic law—Basic Laws in Israel have greater force than other laws as they cannot be easily overturned. Israel has about a dozen such laws. They are akin to a Bill of Rights in a country that has yet to pass a constitution. 2) The Nation-State Law makes clear that Israel is a Jewish state. It will be surprising to some that such a thing needs to be clarified at all. But in Israel, a battle rages over whether Israel should be a Jewish state or a ‘state for all its citizens.’ In June, three Arab MKs attempted to introduce a law called “Basic Law: The State for all its Citizens.” If it was just an Arab minority which held such a position, that would be one thing. But as Yoram Hazony, president of the Herzl Institute, details in his 2001 book, The Jewish State: The Struggle for Israel’s Soul, there is a concerted effort on the part of Israel’s elites to break with their Jewish past and erase their Jewish future. A stronghold of these elites is Israel’s Supreme Court, whose justices espouse a progressive, universalist, and post-Zionist worldview. There’s little doubt this worldview has shaped the Court’s decisions, as recently documented in a report by the Israeli group Regavim. In one of the rare thoughtful responses to the Nation-State law, Dror Eydar, opinion-page editor of Israel Hayom, points out that the law returns balance to the equation a “Jewish-democratic” state. Basic Laws already exist defending the rights of every Israeli citizen. Yet, until last week no Basic Law existed to protect Israel’s Jewish character. As Eydar writes: Not only do people have rights, but the Jewish people have the right to a state of their own in the Land of Israel. … Individual rights, human rights, civil rights – everyone has those. … But national rights in the State of Israel belong to only one nation: the Jewish people. Israel cannot be a state of all its nationalities – a Jewish, Muslim and Christian state. We returned to Israel in order to establish our one state. In the last three thousand years, there has been no separate political entity in this country, which was not Israeli or Jewish. Within the state, everyone has equal rights – as individuals; not as a nationality. Only in this way will our future be assured. It’s not just right. It is also moral. Eydar’s words should embarrass the law’s Jewish critics, from opposition politicians like Meretz MK Tamar Zandberg who decried it as “coercive and belligerent jingoism” to Israeli media pundits who denounced it as “racist,” “destructive,” “a moral collapse.” The pile-on extended to the United States where the American Jewish Committee, the Union for Reform Judaism, and the ADL jumped in before the ink was dry, the first saying it was “deeply disappointed,” the second saying it causes “enormous damage to the legitimacy of the Zionist vision,” and the last declaring the law “raises significant questions” about Israel’s commitment to its “democratic nature.” The shrill attack of Erdogan is one thing. Dreamer of a new Caliphate, he invests heavily in Arab areas of Jerusalem to play custodian of the Muslim sites. The Nation-State Law offers him one more opportunity to posture as leader of all Muslims. Equally comprehensible is the reaction of Israel’s anti-Jewish Arab parliamentarians, who shouted ‘Allahu Akbar” after the law passed, tore up their draft copies and had to be forcibly escorted from the hall. But as Martin Sherman, executive director of the Israel Institute for Strategic Studies, notes, “far more inexplicable, unacceptable, and inexcusable is the fact that over 40 self-professed “Zionist” MKs voted against the bill—including the perversely named “Zionist Union,” Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid, as well as the left-wing Meretz faction.” Indeed, that Jewish Knesset members, Israeli pundits and American Jewish leaders should share a position with an Islamist dictator ought to give them pause, or at least, give second thoughts to those who would heed them. If anything, it proves that the need for the Nation-State Law was acute. Comments are closed.

Why Israel’s Nation-State Law Matters BY: David Isaac https://freebeacon.com/blog/israels-nation-state-law-matters/ On Tuesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared that the “spirit of Hitler has been revived, Israel is the most fascist and racist state.” He then called on—well, everybody—”to work against Israel.” What sent Erdogan into orbit was Israel’s newly minted Nation-State Law, which passed last week by a vote of 62 to 55 after a boisterous Knesset debate lasting over eight hours. The law declares the Land of Israel is the Jewish people’s historic homeland. It identifies symbols of the state—the flag with its Star of David, the menorah, the national anthem Hatikvah (“the Hope”). It codifies certain official holidays like the Sabbath, recognizes Hebrew as the official language and proclaims encouragement for Jewish immigration and Jewish settlement. Much of this sounds ho-hum. The law in good part is a reprise of Israel’s Declaration of Independence, which proclaims that it is the “natural right of the Jewish people to be masters of their own fate, like all other nations, in their own sovereign State.” Nevertheless, the Nation-State Law is significant: 1) It gives the 1948 declaration the force of law. As the first president of Israel’s Supreme Court said: “The Declaration expresses the vision and credo of the people; but it is not a constitutional law making a practical ruling on the upholding or nullification of various ordinances and statutes.” For many years, Israeli legal scholars have called for turning the Declaration into a Basic law—Basic Laws in Israel have greater force than other laws as they cannot be easily overturned. Israel has about a dozen such laws. They are akin to a Bill of Rights in a country that has yet to pass a constitution. 2) The Nation-State Law makes clear that Israel is a Jewish state. It will be surprising to some that such a thing needs to be clarified at all. But in Israel, a battle rages over whether Israel should be a Jewish state or a ‘state for all its citizens.’ In June, three Arab MKs attempted to introduce a law called “Basic Law: The State for all its Citizens.” If it was just an Arab minority which held such a position, that would be one thing. But as Yoram Hazony, president of the Herzl Institute, details in his 2001 book, The Jewish State: The Struggle for Israel’s Soul, there is a concerted effort on the part of Israel’s elites to break with their Jewish past and erase their Jewish future. A stronghold of these elites is Israel’s Supreme Court, whose justices espouse a progressive, universalist, and post-Zionist worldview. There’s little doubt this worldview has shaped the Court’s decisions, as recently documented in a report by the Israeli group Regavim. In one of the rare thoughtful responses to the Nation-State law, Dror Eydar, opinion-page editor of Israel Hayom, points out that the law returns balance to the equation a “Jewish-democratic” state. Basic Laws already exist defending the rights of every Israeli citizen. Yet, until last week no Basic Law existed to protect Israel’s Jewish character.

Right-wing Israeli parties Likud and Jewish Home have rejected requests to modify the racist Nation State bill, Anadolu news agency reported yesterday. This position was announced after the leader of the Israeli party Kulanu, Moshe Kahlone, announced that he would work to modify the bill. Reporting the Israeli government news network KAN, Anadolu said that the leaders of Likud told Kahlone, who is the finance minister and representative of the Druze sect, that there would be no modifications. Jewish Home leader Naftali Bennet strongly rejects modifying the bill, noting there could be a confrontation between the two parties and Kulanu in the Knesset. READ: Israel bans Gaza families from visiting detainees KAN reported Kahlone saying: "The nation state bill was prepared recklessly and it will be modified." Bennet and the Israeli Justice Minister Aylet Shaked have said that they would never accept any form of modification of the bill. On 19 July the Israeli Knesset passed a bill which stipulates that Israel is a nation state for the Jewish people, giving the right to self-determination only to the Jews, making Hebrew the official language and downgrading Arabic to a second language.

News article:
The Israeli Knesset recently passed a landmark piece of legislation that enshrines the State of Israel as “the national home of the Jewish people.” The “Jewish Nation-State Law” officially declares that Israel is both a Jewish and democratic state, protecting the right of the Jewish people to exercise self-determination. On the day of its passage, J Street tweeted that the bill “was born in sin.” The so-called “progressive” lobbying group would go on to claim that “its only purpose is to send a message to the Arab community, the LGBT community and other minorities in Israel, that they are not and never will be equal citizens.” Contrary to J Street’s assertions, this law does not violate the civil rights of non-Jewish Israeli citizens. Professor Eugene Kontorovich of the Kohelet Policy Forum explained that there is nothing undemocratic about this legislation, and that it is quite commonplace among Western democracies. “The law does not infringe on the individual rights of any Israeli citizen, including Arabs; nor does it create individual privileges,” wrote Kontorovich. “The illiberalism here lies with the law’s critics, who would deny the Jewish state the freedom to legislate like a normal country.” Related coverage Palestinian Children Wear Necklaces with Pictures of Their Dead Terrorist ‘Role Models’ The latest trend in the Palestinian Authority (PA) is a new kind of jewelry: Necklace-amulets with pictures of terrorist “Martyrs”... In the European Union alone, at least seven countries have similar constitutional provisions that define nationhood as it applies to their respective contexts. A major difference is that Israel’s Declaration of Independence ensures complete social and political rights “to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.” Israel is one of the best places in the region for its Arab citizens to practice their religion and lead prosperous lives. The Jewish state is home to over 400 mosques, a five fold increase since 1988. The Israeli government also provides the salaries of approximately 300 imams and muezzins, as well as funding for Islamic schools and colleges throughout the country. In Israel’s capital city of Jerusalem, only Muslims are legally allowed to pray on the Temple Mount — Jews are prevented from doing so. Despite the Temple Mount being Judaism’s holiest place, the site is managed by an Islamic religious committee (waqf). The Jewish state displays more respect for the civil rights of its Muslim citizens than they receive in Saudi Arabia, the most Islamic country in the world. Israel also protects Muslim holy sites more than some Arab countries. According to the UK-based Islamic Heritage Research Foundation, over 90 percent of Saudi Arabia’s historical and religious sites have been destroyed since 1985. A Hilton hotel has been built over the home of Islam’s first caliph, while the house of Muhammad’s first wife has been turned into a block of toilets. Throughout the Middle East, Islamic persecution against Christians has resulted in the population plunging from 14% in 1910 to less than 4% today. Yet since Israel declared independence in 1948, its Christian population increased over five fold. Compared to any other religious group in Israel, the Christian minority fares the best in terms of education and can be found in every facet of Israeli life. Yet in the neighboring Palestinian-controlled territories, ethnic cleansing and persecution have reduced the Christian population from 15% of the population to less than 1.3% today. It is also absurd for J Street to accuse Israel of marginalizing its LGBT minority when Israel grants asylum and permanent residency to hundreds of gay Palestinians fleeing persecution. Unless a cure is found for J Street’s anti-Israel derangement obsession, this organization cannot possibly be considered pro-Israel, pro-peace, or even pro-progressive. Bradley Martin is a Fellow for the Haym Salomon Center for American Jewish Thought and Deputy Editor at the Canadian Institute for Jewish Research.

News article:
* Iran was India’s third biggest oil supplier * U.S. reimposes sanctions after quitting Iran deal * SBI wants to protect U.S. operations - source (Adds comments from SBI source, BPCL) NEW DELHI, June 15 (Reuters) - India’s imports of Iranian oil may be hit from the end of August after the State Bank of India informed refiners it would not handle payments for the crude from November, the finance chief of Indian Oil Corp (IOC) said on Friday. The move by the state-controlled bank, India’s biggest, comes after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran last month, pledging to reimpose tough sanctions within 180 days. “(Oil) loading will be affected from end-August under the current mechanism unless a new payment route is established,” IOC’s A. K. Sharma told Reuters in a telephone interview on Friday. Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day “wind-down” period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, notably affecting the petroleum sector, after a 180-day period ending on Nov. 4. Although New Delhi had cut imports from Tehran in 2017/18 due to a dispute over a giant gas field, Iran remained its third-biggest oil supplier. Iran supplied about 458,000 barrels per day (bpd), or about a 10th of India’s more than 4.5 million bpd of imports, in the fiscal year to March 2018. SBI has written to the Indian refiners and the government that it would not be able to handle oil payments to Iran from Nov 4, an official at SBI said. “We have said that we cannot handle oil payments to Iran in any currency as that will have an immediate impact on our U.S. operations,” this source said. An SBI spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. India’s refiners currently use SBI and Germany-based Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank AG (EIH) to buy Iranian oil in euros, according to IOC and other companies. MORE DISCOUNTS? India, Iran’s top oil client after China, was one of the few nations that continued to trade with Tehran during a previous round of Western sanctions. The South Asian nation has said it does not follow U.S. sanctions, but companies and banks with links to the U.S. financial system could face penalties if they do not comply. Iran offers Indian refiners a 60-day credit period on oil sales, which means payment for cargoes loaded from the end of August will be due in November. Analysts feel Iran may have to offer more incentives to protect its oil sales to India. “Indians may ask Iran for more discount in exchange for early payment for oil purchases instead of a 60-day credit period,” said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of East of Suez Oil at consultancy FGE. Seeking to safeguard oil imports from Iran and scout for alternate payment avenues, an Indian delegation last week visited officials and bankers in France, Germany, Britain and Brussels, the base for the European Union. “That visit was only exploratory in nature ...we are still watching the situation,” Indian Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told Reuters this week. Apart from banks, shipping firms and insurance companies have already begun distancing themselves from Iran. IOC’s Sharma said his firm received very few responses to inquiries on hiring tankers to import Iranian oil. “Only NITC (National Iranian Oil Company) and a few others participated, ” he said, adding freight rates for transportation of Iranian oil have also gone up due to the threat of sanctions. ALTERNATE OPPORTUNITIES IOC previously said it would look at buying oil from traditional suppliers mostly in the Middle East to compensate for any cut in supplies from Iran related to U.S. sanctions. Indian state-refiners previously drew up plans to almost double oil imports from Iran, which had offered deep discounts on shipping of crude. Officials at other state refiners Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum Corp confirmed receiving the SBI letter. Mumbai-based refiner Reliance Industries Ltd, owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, plans to halt oil imports from Iran, while Rosneft-promoted Nayara Energy has started cutting purchases from this month, sources previously told Reuters. BPCL’s head of refiners R. Ramachandran said there were other potential suppliers, including Canada and the United States or other Middle East states, that cold replace Iranian crude. “We hope suppliers like Iraq and Saudi Arabia will fill the gap,” he said. “We will get alternatives similar to Iranian oil but we will have to pay extra”.

News article:
Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print By Staff Writer Indian imports of Iranian oil may be heavily affected after August, according to the finance chief of Indian Oil Corp (IOC) on Friday, as the State Bank of India (SBI) has informed refiners that it will not handle payments for the crude from November. The IOC’s A. K. Sharma said: “(Oil) loading will be affected from end-August under the current mechanism unless a new payment route is established.” This move by India’s biggest bank, comes after Donald Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal in May and pledged to renew tough sanctions on the Regime within 180 days. Some sanctions, like those on the auto industry, will take effect on August 6 (90 days after the withdrawal), while those targeting the petroleum sector will come into force on November 4. The reason that Indian refiners will face penalties on August shipments is that payment on them will be due in November. Although India had reduced imports from in Iran in 2017/18, following a dispute over a gas field, Iran remained its third-biggest oil supplier, supplying about 10% (458,000 barrels per day) of India’s oil needs. SBI has already told Indian refiners that it will not be able to handle oil payments to Iran from November 4, as it will impact on their US operations. Indian refiners also use Germany-based Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank AG (EIH) to handle their payments and there is no word yet on whether the EIH will withdraw. Is India turning against Iran? India, which is Iran’s second-biggest oil purchaser, was one of few nations that continued to trade with Tehran during previous sanctions. The country says that they do not follow US sanctions, but Indian companies with ties to the US could face financial penalties if they continue to trade with Iran. Some oil firms in India are seeking out alternative payment methods, through banks that do not operate in the US, but some have speculated that Indian firms will push for bigger discounts from Iran to guarantee their continued trade. It would be better if these firms pulled out of Iran altogether, not just for the companies but for the world as a whole. It would mean less money going to the Iranian Regime’s suppressive forces and less ability for the Regime to threaten the world with its proxy militias and nuclear weapons. Many companies from across the world have already pulled out or announced plans to do so by the deadline, including sporting brand Nike, energy conglomerate Total, and carmaker PSA. There are also very few shipping companies that are now willing to transport Iranian oil, most citing that insurers will not cover the shipment. Indian oil companies should pull out of Iran and purchase oil from other suppliers in the Middle East. Some have already made plans to end or reduce their imports from Iran, including Reliance Industries Ltd and Nayara Energy. But abiding by US sanctions and pushing the Iranian economy to the breaking point, firms that pull out of Iran will be helping to usher in regime change, which is the will of the Iranian people. Regime change will be the major topic of discussion at the Free Iran gathering in Paris later this month.

News article:
The government of India has asked Indian refiners to prepare for a 'drastic reduction or zero' imports of oil from Iran starting this November. Two business insiders told Reuters that the Indian Oil Ministry held a meeting with refiners Thursday in which they were told to search for alternatives to Iranian oil. "[India] has asked refiners to be prepared for any eventuality, since the situation is still evolving. There could be drastic reduction or there could be no import at all," said one source. The warning to refiners comes as the US urges countries around the world, including India, to comply with the sanctions the US is reimposing on Iran following President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. On Thursday, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley called on India to rethink its relationship with Iran. Haley said she understood India "can't change its relationship with Iran in a day" but said she used a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi to encourage a reassessment. "I also think for the future of India, and the future of being able to get resources and who they're dependent on, I would encourage them to rethink their relationship with Iran," she was quoted as having told local broadcaster NDTV after an address in New Delhi. "I think as a friend, India should also decide is this a country that they want to continue doing business with," added Haley. India imports the overwhelming majority of its oil and Iran is the third-largest supplier to the nation of 1.25 billion. India was one of the few counties that continued to buy Iranian oil under the previous round of US and international sanctions which ended with the signing of the 2015 nuclear deal.

News article:
Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print By Staff Writer The US State Department recently announced that the United States expects foreign countries to reduce their imports of Iranian regime’s oil to zero by later in the year. Some countries have already committed to do so; others are preparing to do so. The news came just a matter of weeks after US President Donald Trump announced that the United States would be exiting the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The nuclear agreement was supposed to make Iran curb its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. The other signatories of the deal – the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China and Russia – urged Trump to remain in the deal, but he refused, stating that Iran’s belligerence across the Middle East must not be ignored. Trump announced that sanctions would return and that fresh ones would be applied. India – Iran regime’s second biggest oil client after China – is already starting to cut imports and Indian refiners have started to wean their plants off Iranian crude oil. The country is said to be taking the necessary steps to ensure that it does not get tangled up in sanctions imposed by the United States. Refiners in India have also said that they wish to comply with the limits set by the United States so that they do not lose access to the U.S. financial system. Last month, the monthly oil imports into India from Iran decreased by just over 15 per cent from the month before. Industry data shows that India imported 598,888 barrels per day (bpd) in June. A few weeks ago, the Indian government asked its refiners to prepare for a major cut in imports, and perhaps even a complete halt. The US sanctions will not all come into effect at the same time and it has provisioned a 180 day wind down period that will end on 4th November. The lighter sanctions will take effect at the beginning of August. After a backlash when the State Department announced that it wants foreign companies to reduce imports of Iranian oil to zero, a major price change led the administration to roll back on its rhetoric, saying that each country would be dealt with on a case to case basis. However, the State Department still insists that no waivers will be granted. Refiners in India will find out more about what is expected of them in a meeting that has been scheduled for the beginning of next week. The refiners are due to meet with U.S. officials where their concerns will be addressed. The Iranian regime has hit back against the United States by saying that it is going to block access to the Strait of Hormuz. The strategic waterway is essential for much of the international community and the Iranian regime is trying to exploit this. Several top officials have said that if Iranian oil exports are cut, then no oil will pass through the Strait. However, it is most likely just an empty threat considering that the Strait has a huge role in Iranian imports and exports too.

READ MORE: Germany: Up to India to Go Ahead With Iranian Oil Imports Amid US Sanctions Last week, Indian commerce ministry officials had conveyed to US trade representatives in New Delhi that it was not possible for Indian refiners to stop purchasing oil from Iran, citing several reasons. Although the meeting did not provide solutions to India's concerns, India had firmly conveyed that the state-owned refiners were not going to cut imports to zero due to the sanctions. "Buying oil is a commercial activity and Indian oil importers should continue to import from Iran if ships are available from international ship-owners and oil shipments can find insurers," Narendra Taneja, India's leading energy expert, told Sputnik. Sputnik discussed the payment issue with several government officials in the last few days and most of them exuded confidence that a solution would be found in the next few days.

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, Aug. 5 By Elmira Tariverdiyeva - Trend: The recent deal on Iran's nuclear program suggests new opportunities for development of trade and economic cooperation with the Islamic Republic, and may bring good dividends, if its advantage is taken in time. Azerbaijan is one of the first counties to use the new opportunities and discuss with Iran the future mutually beneficial cooperation in various areas. The two neighboring countries can undoubtedly have considerable benefit from the new political realities. Earlier this week an Azerbaijani governmental delegation, led by the country's Minister of Economy and Industry Shahin Mustafayev, made a working visit to Iran. During the visit, the parties discussed cooperation in the oil and gas industry, the investment sector and railway projects. The sanctions on Iran will be lifted gradually, but it is obvious that the sooner agreements are reached before their removal, the faster the joint projects will launch. During the meetings held as part of the visit, Azerbaijan offered Iran use of its infrastructure to export oil and gas to world markets. Following the lifting of sanctions and increased hydrocarbon production, Iran will be able to use the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline to export its oil. In the future, the country can join the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) that has been initiated by Azerbaijan and is meant to transport gas from the Caspian Sea region to Europe in coming years. Moreover, Azerbaijan has proposed Iran use its gas storage facilities and use the stored gas when their consumption grows. During the meeting with Azerbaijan's Economy and Industry Minister Shahin Mustafayev, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said that Iran is ready to carry out swap deliveries of Azerbaijan's oil to the Persian Gulf region. Zanganeh said oil could be transported from Iran's Neka port on the Caspian Sea via pipeline (with a pumping capacity of 500,000 barrels per day) to the Tehran Oil Refinery. In exchange for this, Azerbaijan will get oil on the southern borders of Iran, Zanganeh added. Nevertheless, all the legal formalities will be complied with in advance in order to start the project's implementation immediately once the sanctions imposed on Iran are lifted. Iran could also cooperate with Azerbaijan in the oil and gas sector in the Caspian Sea, according to Zanganeh. The Iranian minister's proposal about the joint production of oil equipment, as well as at the enterprises, opened on the territory of Azerbaijan, is interesting. This will allow opening over 100 jobs in our country. Minister Mustafayev said that Azerbaijan and Iran are ready for joint investments in the production of petroleum equipment. Moreover, Azerbaijan and Iran discussed the possibility of joint investing in other countries' gas sectors. Of course, this can also become one of the more profitable areas of cooperation. The synchronization of electric power systems of Iran and Azerbaijan, the construction of a hydroelectric power station on the border or within the country is an interesting item on the agenda of the visit of the Azerbaijani delegation. The electricity generated by new power plants will be used in Azerbaijan and Iran and sold to other countries. During the Azerbaijani delegation's visit to Iran, the sides reached an agreement on the establishment of a working group to analyze the current situation and the coordination of positions on the North-South railway project. The "North-South" railway will connect Northern Europe with South East Asia and will serve as a bridge to connect the railways of Iran, Azerbaijan and Russia. This railway project is going to be very beneficial for all sides. The capacity of the railway will be 1.4 million passengers and 5 million to 7 million metric tons of cargo a year, making the project one of the most important in the region, according to preliminary estimates. Today, Azerbaijan, which didn't impose sanctions against Iran and always maintained good relations with it, turned out to be in a more advantageous position than the West, as the country will not need confidence-building measures and won't have to start cooperation from scratch. Baku will try to use this chance 100 percent as Iran, which has now become the most interesting field for investment, because of the circumstances, was the only country in the region except Armenia, where Azerbaijan didn't invest. Now, together with major investments in Turkey, Georgia and other countries, Baku can implement large investment projects in Iran, which will bring considerable profits to the Azerbaijani treasury in the future.

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, Aug. 6 By Rufiz Hafizoglu - Trend: First, the recent events in the southeastern provinces of Turkey caused problems with the transportation of goods from the country to Iran and the markets of Central Asia. Iran has been periodically closing the border with Turkey due to security concerns. This is another consequence of these events. Of course, this causes great damage to the Turkish side. Ankara perceives the expected lifting of sanctions against Tehran very positively. But Ankara is not convinced that Iran can become the single and non-alternative corridor for the transportation of goods to the markets of Central Asia. Sooner or later this will lead to the fact that Turkey will be forced to seek alternative routes to enter the markets of Central Asia. In an interview with Turkish media, Seray Ozkan, researcher at Caspian Strategy Institute (HASEN) emphasized the importance of diversifying the Central Asian markets in order to avoid risks which the Iranian market can be fraught with. Earlier, Cetin Nuhoglu, head of Turkey's International Transporters Association said that Iran creates artificial barriers for Turkish transporters. "The delivery of 70 percent of Turkish cargoes is delayed due to the Iranian side," Nuhoglu added. Moreover, member of the executive board of Turkey's International Transporters Association Elif Sevim told Trend that Turkey is considering the possibility of using the Georgia-Azerbaijan route for cargo transportation to Turkmenistan bypassing Iran. Given the existence of serious problems today in Iran, which is a transit country for the transportation of goods from Turkey, Azerbaijan can become such a country. Currently, Turkish trucks spend the time standing on the Turkish-Iranian and Iranian-Turkmen border for a long period, sometimes up to 10 days. If Azerbaijan becomes a transit country, it will make it possible to reduce this period twice, and that is in the interests of Turkey. Against the background of the real problems with the delivery of goods via Iran to the markets of Central Asia, one must remember that Turkey and China agreed on the joint use of roads, and the parties will sign an agreement on this issue in February 2016. There remains only to choose a final route for importing goods to Turkey, and Azerbaijan has extensive potential to become a transit country. Taking this into account, it is possible to say that sooner or later Azerbaijan will become a transit country for transportation of goods from Turkey to Turkmenistan on ro-ro vessels. In other words, Azerbaijan's importance for Turkey, as well as for the region is growing.

Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani says the nuclear agreement reached between the Islamic Republic and six world powers opens new horizons for further promotion of ties between Iran and Georgia. Larijani made the remark in a meeting with Gubaz Sanikidze, the head of the Iran-Georgia Parliamentary Friendship Group, in, Press TV reported on Aug.10. He said that Tehran and Tbilisi should facilitate the activities of merchants, chambers of commerce and private sectors of the two countries to help develop bilateral trade and economic ties. Larijani said that Majlis (Parliament) supports parliamentary ties between Iran and Georgia and welcomes further political consultations between the two countries amid the ongoing tensions in the region. The Georgian lawmaker, for his part, said that his country embraces the nuclear agreement between Iran and the P5+1 countries - the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China plus Germany, adding that it could pave the way for further development of bilateral ties as well as restoration of peace, stability and security in the region. Sanikidze also praised Iran's status in the region as well as its role in the settlement of crises and conflicts. On July 14, Iran and the six world powers finalized the text of an agreement, dubbed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in the Austrian capital of Vienna. Under the JCPOA, limits will be put on Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for, among other things, the removal of sanctions against the Islamic Republic. "US wrong policies breed terrorism" The visiting Georgian parliamentarian also held a separate meeting with Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the chairman of the National Security and Foreign Policy Committee of Majlis, during which the two sides exchanged views on the issue of terrorism as well as bilateral cooperation. Boroujerdi blamed the US wrong policies for the spread of terrorism in the Middle East region and called for collective efforts among all regional countries to counter the menace. "The US wrong policies have led to an unbridled growth of terrorism in the region, and the persistence of this trend would pose a global danger to all countries," he said. The Georgian lawmaker, for his part, described Iran's nuclear agreement as historic and said it proved that negotiations are the best solution and that sanctions could not settle differences. He also called for Iran-Georgia cooperation in the campaign against terrorism and said the Islamic Republic can help boost security in the region.

Baku, Azerbaijan, Aug. 18 By Fatih Karimov - Trend: Azerbaijan's neighboring Iranian province is keen to boost trade turnover with Baku. More cooperation between Baku and Iran's northwestern Ardabil Province bordering Azerbaijan is needed, Iran's Ambassador to Azerbaijan Mohsen Pak Ayeen told Trend August 18. "Considering capabilities available in Ardabil, the province is able to share the highest level among Iranian provinces in term of exporting goods to the Republic of Azerbaijan." Pak Ayeen stressed that further development of economic ties between Ardabil and Azerbaijan is among the Embassy's priorities and urged Azerbaijani media representatives to travel to the province to better expose opportunities available there. Speaking about plans to ensure all day activity in the custom offices, Pak Ayeen said that the two sides had agreed on the issue in principle and the plan will be implemented after proper equipment is installed and a labor force is placed in the four acting custom checkpoints, the report adds. The Iranian ambassador also pointed out problems with the travel of Iranian citizens to Azerbaijan: "We asked the Azerbaijani Embassy to Tehran and the Consulate-General in Tabriz to facilitate with the issue of visas for Iranian traders," he stressed. According to the report, the top Iranian diplomat described the establishment of a joint trade chamber between the two countries as a necessary step to accelerate bilateral trade. He also expressed his hope that the draft MOU text submitted by the Iranian side in this regard would be approved during the coming ninth session of the Joint Commission on Cooperation, the report adds. Data released by Iran's Customs Organizations shows that the volume of exports via the Ardabil Province has declined by 8.9 percent in the first quarter of the current Iranian year compared with the same period of last year. However, there was a 15.7 million dollars increase in the value of the exported goods, the figures suggest. Edited by CN

News article:
Ukraine’s economy minister says he will follow his European colleagues to Iran seeking business opportunities from the anticipated easing of sanctions on the isolated Islamic Republic. Economy Minister Aivaras Abromavicius says his three-day trip starting September 14 will include a “large group of industrial leaders” as well the war-torn state’s agriculture minister. Abromavicius tells a Ukrainian cabinet meeting that the former Soviet nation wanted to “improve relations with (Iran) after what we hope will be the lifting of sanctions by the US Congress.” A range of European countries — including economic powerhouse Germany — have already either sent business delegations to Tehran or lifted some of their unilateral trade restrictions on Iran. Kiev’s state statistics service says trade between the two countries only reached $756 million last year. Ukrainian exports accounted for more than 90 percent of that amount. — AFP

Ukraine's minister of economy and trade says he will soon pay an official visit to Iran to discuss the existing grounds for economic and trade cooperation between the two countries. The announcement by the Ukrainian minister comes at a time that high-ranking officials from other European countries have already visited Iran following the conclusion of the Islamic Republic’s nuclear talks with the P5+1 group of countries in the Austrian capital, Vienna, on July 14. Speaking to a cabinet meeting in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, on Wednesday, Aivaras Abromavicius said his three-day visit to Iran is scheduled to start on September 14, AFP reported. The minister added that during his trip to Iran, he will be heading a delegation consisting of a "large group of industrial leaders" as well the Ukrainian agriculture minister. “On September 14-16, I'm likely to go [to Iran] with the agricultural minister and a large group of entrepreneurs and industrialists to establish cooperation with the country,” he was quoted by the Interfax News Agency as saying. Abromavicius stated that his country is willing to "improve relations with (Iran) after what we hope will be the lifting of sanctions by the US Congress." The minister added that when international sanctions against Iran are lifted, there will be “huge opportunities” for cooperation between the two countries, adding, “Last week we discussed the cooperation directions with the [Iranian] ambassador [to Kiev]. Mainly it concerns companies on metro engineering and other types of engineering." On July 14, Iran and the P5+1 group of countries — the US, the UK, Germany, France, China, and Russia — reached the conclusion of negotiations over Tehran’s civilian nuclear program, with the Islamic Republic and the sextet sealing an agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Based on JCPOA, the sextet agreed to remove all sanctions imposed on Iran’s economic and energy sectors in return for certain restrictions in Iran's nuclear program. According to Ukraine’s state statistics service, the volume of trade between the two countries stood at USD 756 million last year with Ukraine’s exports to Iran accounting for more than 90 percent of that figure.

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, Aug. 25 Trend: A rapporteur of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) will address the parliament with a report on Armenia's "water terrorism". Azerbaijani Deputy Minister of Agriculture Ilham Guliyev met with a delegation headed by the Rapporteur of the PACE Committee on Social Affairs, Health and Sustainable Development Milica Markovic August 25. The aim of the delegation's visit is to prepare a report entitled "Intentional deprivation of the inhabitants of Azerbaijani border regions of water." During the meeting Guliyev informed the guests that historically Azerbaijan is an agrarian country. After gaining independence, the economy is being rapidly developed. The country's leadership attaches great importance to the agrarian sector. Important decisions and orders related to the development of this industry are made, the Ministry of Agriculture told Trend. "As a result of the occupation of the Sarsang reservoir by Armenian aggressors, water has not been supplied for many years for irrigating the Tartar, Barda, Goranboy, Yevlakh and Agjabadi districts," Guliyev said. "This causes irreparable damage to the economy of this region." "Armenians deliberately use water in an excess volume, particularly, in autumn and winter at night, by posing a threat of flooding the villages in these areas and thereby sowing fear and panic among people," he said. "As a result of care of the head of state for this area, 586 artesian wells were drilled on the area within the scope of Sarsang reservoir in order to improve water supply to crops. This requires additional budgetary funds," said the deputy minister. He went on to add that construction of many facilities of land reclamation and water industry remained unfinished in the zone of occupation, and over time they all have been destroyed and put out of action. "About 500,000 residents in the flood zone of Tartar and Barda districts, as well as those residing in more than 130 settlements of Agdere, Barda, Tartar, Zardab and Agdash districts are living under a real threat as a result of targeted actions and provocations of the Armenians," Guliyev said. The deputy minister informed the guests that the water resources of the Samur transboundary river are used in full accordance with the intergovernmental agreement between Russia and Azerbaijan, while the use of water and energy resources of the Araz river is governed by a joint Iranian-Azerbaijani commission. PACE rapporteur expressed gratitude for a warm reception and said that this is her second visit to Azerbaijan. She also noted that she is familiar with the difficulties in water supply of the residents of regions bordering with Armenia. Milica Markovic went on to add that on the basis of the collected materials she will give a speech in the parliament with a report on the deliberate deprivation of water of the inhabitants of bordering regions.

"The occurrence of mud volcanoes and their impact on the drilling work, the exploration of deep-sea gas hydrates and assessing of their reserves, joint study of modern computer programs used in the oil and gas industry were determined as promising areas of cooperation between Azerbaijani and Iranian oil industry workers. The joint research of regional seismic data and study of the general stratigraphy and structural-tectonic features, as well as other issues were also among these areas." In his turn, Yusifzade said that cooperation in the oil and gas sphere between Azerbaijan and Iran has long history. He also stressed the importance of using the joint cooperation opportunities between Azerbaijan and Iran in the field of exploration and development of oil and gas fields after a long break. "There are very good prospects to strengthen relations in the energy sector between our countries," said the first vice-president of SOCAR, stressing the importance to further hold such meetings. "I am confident that the relations in this sphere will strengthen the economic development of our countries." It was earlier reported that in August 2014, an Azerbaijani delegation led by the first vice-president of Azerbaijani State Oil Company (SOCAR), academician Khoshbakht Yusifzadeh visited Iran at an invitation from Iran's Khazar Exploration and Production Company (KEPCO).

By Dave Goldiner June 27, 2018 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the insurgent firebrand who Tuesday toppled the No. 4 Democrat in the House of Representatives, is a strong critic of Israel who denounced the killings of Palestinian protesters as a “massacre.” This is a massacre. I hope my peers have the moral courage to call it such. No state or entity is absolved of mass shootings of protesters. There is no justification. Palestinian people deserve basic human dignity, as anyone else. Democrats can’t be silent about this anymore. https://t.co/wJGATOtDsR — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) May 14, 2018 Ocasio-Cortez, 28, stunned the political world by decisively beating Joe Crowley, a Queens powerbroker who had been mentioned as a possible future candidate for Speaker of the House. With about 90% of precincts reporting, Ocasio-Cortez was ahead by 58%-to-42%, making Crowley the first incumbent Democrat to lose his seat this year. Ocasio-Cortez said she feels as strongly about the killings in Gaza as she would if the slain protesters were in Ferguson, Missouri or in Puerto Rico, where her family has roots. “Especially in New York people say this is political suicide,” Ocasio-Cortez told Glenn Greenwald of the Intercept, referring to her criticism of Israel. “But I had a lot of my constituents thanking me for taking that position. I had a lot of Jewish Americans who thanked me.”

“I think that we have the grounds to do it,” Ocasio-Cortez told CNN’s Poppy Harlow on Wednesday, before changing the subject to the upcoming midterm elections. “I think what really we need to focus on is that we are advocating for the policies to win in November.” Advertisement When pressed about her decision to support impeachment, Ocasio-Cortez pointed to Trump’s potential violation of the emoluments clause, which forbids government officials from accepting payments from foreign governments. “I think that there are serious grounds in violations of the emoluments clause from day one,” she said. “I think that is, first and foremost, one of the basic elements and violations.” “And then, once again, it’s hard to predict what’s going to happen over the next few months,” she continued. “There are one or more investigations happening. But I think, from day one, we have had violations of the emoluments clause with the presidency.” My full intv w/ @Ocasio2018 who just won a HUGE upset in NY-14. The 28 yr old Latina tells me "we took that message to doors that had never been knocked on before" & if elected would push for Trump impeachment, push to abolish ICE, & endorses @CynthiaNixon https://t.co/flBX2CzHL4 — Poppy Harlow (@PoppyHarlowCNN) June 27, 2018 Advertisement Only a handful of lawmakers, including Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) have publicly called for Trump’s impeachment. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has pushed back against their efforts, stating that impeachment would fail if it was seen as partisan. A majority of House members are needed for impeachment to move forward. Given the GOP’s majority hold on Congress, it’s unlikely this could occur under current circumstances. Some Democratic lawmakers are hopeful the midterm elections will flip enough seats in Congress to pave the way for impeachment. Ocasio-Cortez on Wednesday stood by her desire to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement if elected to Congress in November. “We absolutely do need to make sure that our borders are secure,” Ocasio-Cortez said on CNN. “But what we need to realize and remember is that ICE was established in 2003 right at the same time as the Patriot Act, the AUMF, the Iraq War ― and we look back at a lot of that time and legislation as a mistake now. And I think that ICE is right there as a part of it.” “Its extrajudicial nature is based into the structure of the agency,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “We can replace it with a humane agency that is directed toward safe passage instead of the direction of the criminalization.” Advertisement Following her shocking victory Tuesday night, Ocasio-Cortez made the rounds on several morning news shows Wednesday. When asked on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” why she often refrained from calling out Trump directly during her campaign, Ocasio-Cortez said she felt it wasn’t the best way forward. “What we need to do is lay out a plan and a vision that people can believe in,” she said. “And getting into Twitter fights with the president is not exactly where we’re going to find progress as a nation.”

News article:
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had never run for political office, but her primary victory against long-time New York congressman Joe Crowley illustrates how the changing face of the Democratic base can help bring the party back to its roots. Though the young Latina from the Bronx is being noted for her leftist politics as a self-described socialist, Ocasio-Cortez told NBC News her message simply resonated because voters could relate to many of the issues she campaigned on: criminal justice reform, tuition-free college and trade school and health care for all. "These the issues that win," said Ocasio-Cortez, who described herself as a working-class American, "because these are the issues that speak to people's hearts and to their futures." Working-class is not just "white" Julia Hellwege, an assistant professor of Political Science at the University of South Dakota said there is a stigma that equates minority candidates like Ocasio-Cortez with identity politics. “Identity politics does not mean minority politics. Whiteness is an identity. Motherhood is an identity. We have multiple layers to who we are," said Hellwege. Democrats are “still stuck on the narrative that they messed up [in 2016] by not concentrating on the working class, which is largely viewed as a white perspective," said Celeste Montoya, a professor of Political Science and Women and Gender Studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder. "Ocasio-Cortez represents one of the most loyal demographics for the Democrats," said Montoya. Almost half of the Ocasio-Cortez's district is Latino; over 11 percent is black and 16 percent is Asian. "The working class is not just a white male experience," said Montoya. Ocasio-Cortez "connected with her voters on working class issues, the problems of homelessness, motherhood, and discrimination in the workplace.” Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi warned against drawing any broad conclusions from Ocasio-Cortez’ politics in a press conference following Crowley’s loss. "They made a choice in one district, so let’s not get yourself carried away,” she said. But Christina Bejarano, associate professor of Political Science at Kansas University, said Ocasio-Cortez's election could be a sign of things to come and has the potential to shake up the Democratic Party. "Her election is a way to let the party know that women of color are key as voters and candidates. The party "shouldn’t take them for granted", she said. "Now we're more visible" Ocasio-Cortez is no stranger to politics; she worked in the late Senator Ted Kennedy’s office on foreign affairs and immigration while she was a student at Boston University and was an organizer for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 election. Ocasio-Cortez has worked as a community activist and protested the pipeline at Standing Rock. But like other women this year, this is the first time she ran for office. Latinas in particular have done well in this election cycle. New Mexico Congresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham won her Democratic primary earlier this month in her quest to become governor and Lupe Valdez will be representing the Democratic Party in the race for Governor in Texas. Late last year, Elizabeth Guzmán and Hala Ayala made history in Virginia as the first Hispanic women elected to the state's House of Delegates. One takeaway from this election cycle is that these wins will result in more Latinas seeing themselves as part of the viable pool of candidates who can run for office, said Hellwege. A key barrier to running is visualizing oneself in the race, and with the growing number of Hispanic women winning their races, more Latinas will likely draw on their inspiration. “Now we’re more visible,” says Hellwege. But Montoya warned that the Democratic party has sometimes been "lukewarm" in their support of minority, and especially progressive, candidates. "Identity politics is not the reason movements fail, it is a result of movement failures," said Montoya. The key, she said, is for the party to reach out "equally" to candidates like Ocasio-Cortez. For her part, Ocasio-Cortez said her message resonated because so many could identify with it. “I’m a working-class American, my mom cleaned homes and drove school buses to make sure we could make ends meet and I spent time during the financial crisis waiting tables," she said. "So I understand what it means to be a real, working-class person in America and that is so important to have that perspective in our leadership.” FOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.

Trevor Noah, host of “The Daily Show,” couldn’t contain his excitement Wednesday about the Democratic primary victory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York’s 14th Congressional District. “This is so amazing, man,” Noah said. “Not only would she be the youngest female ever elected to Congress, she’d also be the first member of Congress that talks like Cardi B. Like this is so dope.” Advertisement Ocasio-Cortez’s Democratic nomination for the U.S. House seat is notable because she defeated incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley, who has been in Congress since 1999 and was widely thought to be the heir apparent to Nancy Pelosi as leader of House Democrats. “Not only would Ocasio-Cortez be a groundbreaker but she ran on a heavily progressive platform that was really popular: free health care, free college education, a federal jobs guarantee, and she wants to abolish ICE,” Noah said. “She’s so left that she makes Bernie Sanders look like Mitt Romney. Like, it’s insane.” Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. “She’s far left,” Noah said. “She had no support from the Democratic Party. And, unlike her opponent, she had no big money behind her. Nobody expected her to win.” Noah added: “So for a few hours this morning, progressives were like, ‘Hey, maybe the future is not as bad as it seems.’ And the future was like, ‘Oh, you don’t know me.’” Advertisement

News article:
Washington – Ready or not, change is coming to the House Democrats. Across the country, a new generation is making its way to Washington. It’s not just that some of the Democrats, like 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are young and progressive. They are. Or that many are women entering politics who want to fight President Donald Trump. They do. Or even that some of them live in Trump country. They also come to politics steeped in an era of resistance and revolt, like the tea party Republicans who rose against President Barack Obama and the so-called Watergate babies elected after President Richard Nixon. If the newcomers provide the numbers to give Democrats control of the House, or even fall short and end up in the ranks of the minority, they will be a force to be reckoned with upon arrival. That holds especially true for Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the longtime House Democratic leader. “There is a hunger for generational change, for a new generation of leadership,” said freshman Rep. Ro Khanna of California. “I think we’re going to see some of the most impressive young people being elected across the country, and it’s going to be, in my view, an extraordinary class, like the Watergate Class.” Last Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez pulled off a stunning primary election romp in New York, toppling 10-term congressman Joe Crowley of Queens. He was once thought of as a possible successor to Pelosi, but has now become a symbol of how the party is being transformed in the Trump era. The defeat of Crowley, the Democratic caucus chairman, opens up the fourth spot on the leadership rung. A robust contest is expected to replace him, but the leadership changes may not stop there. Several Democratic candidates for Congress have said they would not support Pelosi as leader. And even some of those Democrats who want Pelosi to reclaim the speaker’s gavel, if Democrats retake the majority, have made clear that new approaches are needed. Yet there remains no obvious replacement for Pelosi or the second-ranking Democrat, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, so many aren’t convinced there will be an immediate leadership shuffle after the election. But in the next few years, even newcomers “like Alexandria could be there,” said Khanna, who backed both Ocasio-Cortez and Crowley in the race. “The traditional rules of politics don’t apply.” Pelosi has shown no signs of loosening her hold on leadership, however. “We just want to win,” she told reporters this week. She recalled the questions she heard after the Women’s March in 2017, when people would ask how Democrats were going to use all of that energy. She said she told them, “It’s not a question of how we will use it. It’s a question about how they will use us.” She added last week: “Everything is at stake in our country. People all see the urgency of it, they want to take responsibility for it. That gives us an opportunity to win.” “So I just say, ‘Just win, baby,'” she said. Two-term Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, an Iraq War combat Marine, is not one to discount the staying power of Pelosi and the other top leaders. But he is certain they will be tested by the new arrivals. “Whoever the leaders are of this caucus, are going to have to be accountable to this new caucus that’s going in,” he said. “They’re going to have to come to caucus and give arguments — why they are in leadership and why they should stay in leadership.” One traditional factor in leadership races has been fundraising. Pelosi has been the party’s top fundraiser, and Crowley has long been skilled at bringing donors to the table. But the younger generation of Democrats doesn’t value fundraising the way leaders do. At a time when candidates like Ocasio-Cortez can win a primary with a big social media presence and small-dollar donations, they don’t need to cozy up to the party power structure. As far as traditional arguments to win leadership races, “that’s not going to fly with these incoming members of Congress,” Gallego said. Other competing factors will be at play when House Democrats decide their leadership slate, including ideology and geography. Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, a co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said Democrats need “to make sure progressives are represented in leadership.” The primary elections are showing that “bold progressive messages work, and we’re hoping leadership will take that to heart,” he said. Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois, one of a dozen Democrats who represent districts that Trump won in the 2016 election, said it’s the corners of the country like her Midwestern stronghold that should have more voice in leadership. She wants the caucus to reflect the nation’s geographic diversity. “Where we need more Democrats is in these districts that are a little tougher to navigate,” Bustos said. “And I think it’s very important that we don’t lose sight of that.” As the top Democrat on the rules committee, Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts said he would like to loosen the process to give more rank-and-file lawmakers a chance to propose amendments. That would allow them to bring their ideas to the table. McGovern said it recently took him two hours to shop for groceries back home because so many constituents stopped to talk with him. Voters, he said, want Democrats “to stand up to Trump’s racism and his bigotry and all his hateful policies.” But they also want them to make strides on Democratic priorities, he said. “What people are looking for is not just for us to be right on the issues,” he said. “They want to know what we’re going to do to fight for these issues.”

Washington – Ready or not, change is coming to the House Democrats. Across the country, a new generation is making its way to Washington. It’s not just that some of the Democrats, like 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are young and progressive. They are. Or that many are women entering politics who want to fight President Donald Trump. They do. Or even that some of them live in Trump country.

News article:
The Democrats are in the midst of a leadership crisis. Editorial boards, progressive Democrats and Republican detractors insist something must be done about 78-year-old House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Complaints range from her age to her relatively moderate political views. Yet when it comes to fundraising, navigating intraparty politics and White House negotiations, Pelosi proves difficult to replace. "There is no one like her," Jason Altmire, who represented Pennsylvania's 4th Congressional District between 2007 and 2013, told Newsweek. "She works harder than anyone else, she's a better fundraiser and a tremendous leader." Pelosi, for the record, says she isn't going anywhere. "We will win. I will run for speaker," she said in an interview with The Boston Globe last week. "I feel confident about it. And my members do, too." But if she does win another term, she'll complete it as an octogenarian, and some members of the House aren't yet willing to pledge their allegiance to her seemingly unending reign. "There will be an insurgency; I just don't know who's leading it," Representative Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri told The New York Times. "But I can assure you that I am as certain of that as I am that today is Wednesday." Since taking a leadership role in 2002, Pelosi has managed to raise a staggering $660 million on behalf of the Democratic Party. In the first three months of 2018 alone, Pelosi raised $16.1 million, according to her campaign office. Almost all of that money, $15.4 million of it, went to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). Between January and March, the minority leader held 71 fundraising events across the country and has so far raised a total of $66.7 million this election cycle. House Speaker Paul Ryan, meanwhile, earned $11 million in the first quarter of 2018, bringing his total for the cycle to $54 million. "Democrats will have to tap into multiple sources of funding to fill her role because it's not likely that one person will be able to replicate her skills," explained John Lawrence, who worked as chief of staff to Pelosi for eight years, to Newsweek. Former DCCC Chair Steve Israel spent decades raising money alongside Pelosi. "Nearly half of the donations we received were because of Pelosi, not the DCCC," he said to Newsweek. "So many people said, 'I'll contribute because I believe in Pelosi.' A good part of that money disappears when and if she leaves. You need someone who can fill that vacuum." That person seemed to be Representative Jim Crowley, until he lost his seat of 20 years last week in an upset by 28-year-old Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. "I was at the National Democratic Club in D.C. last month, and a lot of Congressional members were there talking openly about Crowley being speaker," Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist, told Newsweek. "It was a wake for Pelosi and she wasn't even dead yet. I mean they were speaking openly about this, just casual conversation at the bar." In the course of a week, that conversation changed, and the field of successors is more uncertain. Many names are being floated, like Democratic National Committee Deputy Chair Keith Ellison, former Congressional Black Caucus Chair Elijah Cummings, Democratic Policy and Communications Committee Co-chair Cheri Bustos, Michael Bloomberg–backed Seth Moulton, former Pelosi challenger Tim Ryan, Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Cedric Richmond, Congressional Progressive Caucus Co-chair Mark Pocan and Democratic Policy and Communications Committee Co-chair Hakeem Jeffries. Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, has also been mentioned as a possible replacement, but Israel, his good friend, told Newsweek that Schiff has no interest in the role. The pool of possible leaders is large, but Democratic strategists and former Pelosi staffers and associates agree on three standouts: Representative Joe Kennedy, House Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Linda Sánchez and DCCC Chair Ben Ray Luján. Joe Kennedy, a grandson of Robert Kennedy, only entered Congress in 2013 and hasn't taken on any caucus roles, but he's already established himself as a national voice on progressive issues and a major force in fundraising, with nearly $3 million raised this session. That makes him one of the few candidates able to match Pelosi's fundraising skills, according to some insiders. Still, other strategists see Kennedy as a candidate with presidential ambitions and don't think he'll enter the race. Representative Linda Sánchez became the first Latina to win a Democratic House leadership role back in 2016. In October 2017, she criticized current leadership for its unwillingness to pass the torch to the next generation. "Our leadership does a tremendous job, but we do have this real breadth and depth of talent within our caucus, and I do think it's time to pass the torch to a new generation of leaders," Sanchez said on C-SPAN. Democratic strategists agree that minority and female leadership would benefit the party. "One of the things to keep in mind is that if Democrats do take back control of the House, it will be because of female candidates who ran and won," said Bannon. "The speaker should represent that fact." Sánchez has raised a total of $1.5 million this session. As head of the DCCC, Congressman Ben Ray Luján has extensive experience fundraising. He also has a cache of political capital with the incoming class of Democratic representatives, most of whom he helped get elected. Under his watch, the DCCC is currently outpacing money earned in 2016, a presidential election year. "Luján has to be carefully regarded," said Lawrence. "DCCC chairmanship gives you exposure to new members and members of the caucus. He's also a member of a growing Hispanic caucus in the house and is very often traveling around the country speaking with potential funders." And the DCCC chair is often a "default speaker," according to some strategists. In that role, Luján is privy to the inner politics of the party but has yet to show his experience negotiating with Republicans and the White House. The field is crowded, but Democrats would be remiss to believe that Pelosi hasn't been grooming potential successors for years, said Israel. "I sat in the room with her in 2012, 2014 and 2016 when we went through lists of younger members who she wanted to cultivate," he told Newsweek. "I think that Democrats would be well-advised not to discount Nancy Pelosi and not to make this decision flippantly."

Joe Kennedy, a grandson of Robert Kennedy, only entered Congress in 2013 and hasn't taken on any caucus roles, but he's already established himself as a national voice on progressive issues and a major force in fundraising, with nearly $3 million raised this session. That makes him one of the few candidates able to match Pelosi's fundraising skills, according to some insiders. Still, other strategists see Kennedy as a candidate with presidential ambitions and don't think he'll enter the race. Representative Linda Sánchez became the first Latina to win a Democratic House leadership role back in 2016. In October 2017, she criticized current leadership for its unwillingness to pass the torch to the next generation. "Our leadership does a tremendous job, but we do have this real breadth and depth of talent within our caucus, and I do think it's time to pass the torch to a new generation of leaders," Sanchez said on C-SPAN. Democratic strategists agree that minority and female leadership would benefit the party. "One of the things to keep in mind is that if Democrats do take back control of the House, it will be because of female candidates who ran and won," said Bannon. "The speaker should represent that fact." Sánchez has raised a total of $1.5 million this session. As head of the DCCC, Congressman Ben Ray Luján has extensive experience fundraising. He also has a cache of political capital with the incoming class of Democratic representatives, most of whom he helped get elected. Under his watch, the DCCC is currently outpacing money earned in 2016, a presidential election year. "Luján has to be carefully regarded," said Lawrence. "DCCC chairmanship gives you exposure to new members and members of the caucus. He's also a member of a growing Hispanic caucus in the house and is very often traveling around the country speaking with potential funders." And the DCCC chair is often a "default speaker," according to some strategists. In that role, Luján is privy to the inner politics of the party but has yet to show his experience negotiating with Republicans and the White House. The field is crowded, but Democrats would be remiss to believe that Pelosi hasn't been grooming potential successors for years, said Israel. "I sat in the room with her in 2012, 2014 and 2016 when we went through lists of younger members who she wanted to cultivate," he told Newsweek. "I think that Democrats would be well-advised not to discount Nancy Pelosi and not to make this decision flippantly."

News article:
Cynthia Nixon, an actress and education activist, is challenging New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo from the left. Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon is escalating her criticism of Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) for taking donations from President Donald Trump after Cuomo announced Thursday that he would keep the years-old contributions. “Governor Cuomo cannot serve as a defense against Donald Trump when he’s accepted tens of thousands of dollars from him,” said Nixon campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt. Advertisement Nixon, an actress and education activist challenging Cuomo from the left, had previously blasted the governor for taking the money, which Trump donated years before he ran for president. Her attacks aim to undercut Cuomo’s attempts to frame himself as a leading opponent of Trump’s immigration, tax and offshore drilling policies. Nixon’s campaign has bought Facebook ads soliciting signatures for petitions urging Cuomo to “return all campaign donations from Donald Trump NOW!” In a fundraising email on Thursday, Nixon also invoked the contributions, asking supporters to “counter Andrew Cuomo’s warchest full of Trump money” with their own donations to her. “This is nothing more than a cheap distraction from a campaign gasping for air. No governor has fought harder against Donald Trump than Gov. Cuomo,” his campaign spokeswoman Abbey Fashouer told HuffPost. Advertisement Cuomo received a total of $64,000 from Trump between 2001 and 2009, a period during which he was an unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate and then attorney general of New York. The governor responded to a question about the contributions on Thursday at an unrelated event in Brooklyn. “I’m going to be deeply critical of him and keep the contributions,” Cuomo said. Cuomo is positioning himself as a leading bulwark against the policies of the Trump administration. Eduardo Munoz / Reuters Nixon’s broadsides are the latest in a series of attempts to peel away progressive support for the two-term governor, who enjoys a massive fundraising advantage and a sizable lead in the polls. Cuomo’s campaign donors have been a key point of contention from the start of the primary race with Nixon arguing that he is too beholden to the state’s real estate and financial industry titans. Cuomo recently suggested that he would stop taking donations from the fossil fuel industry, before promptly walking back the idea. Advertisement Nixon has raised $1.1 million with $430,000 still on hand, while Cuomo had nearly $30.5 million in his war chest as of January. As of November, nearly 99.9 percent of Cuomo’s contributions were in increments of $200 or more; 99 percent were in increments of $1,000 or more. Cuomo has repeatedly insisted that donations do not affect his policies or decision-making, not least when it comes to resisting Trump’s agenda. On Thursday afternoon, he touted the success of the Liberty Defense Project, a state-funded legal aid program for immigrants. The program had secured pro bono legal representation for Yeni Maricela Gonzalez Garcia, an undocumented Guatemalan immigrant whose children were separated from her at the border, the governor’s office announced. Nixon is betting that her criticism will nonetheless find a receptive audience in the restive Democratic primary electorate. The upset primary victory last week of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old progressive newcomer, over 10-term incumbent congressman and Queens party boss Joseph Crowley (D) suggests that at least some Democrats are focused on the outsized influence of money in politics. Ocasio-Cortez ran heavily on her refusal to take corporate PAC money and slammed Crowley for his coziness with real estate developers and other business interests. Nixon, who endorsed Ocasio-Cortez the day before the election, has experienced a significant bump in interest in her campaign since the insurgent progressive’s win. Nixon’s campaign said they’re seeing more volunteers, and she raised $25,000 in the 24-hour period after Ocasio-Cortez’s victory. Advertisement

News article:
The Democrats have an all-but-unbeatable potential presidential candidate lined up for 2020. She’s a woman who enjoys an A rating from the National Rifle Association and brags about going out to shoot the family turkey for Thanksgiving. She has spoken out in favor of federal fines for sanctuary cities, supported making English the national language, called for more border enforcement and opposed driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants. She is a fiscal moderate and a proud face of rural America. Ohio? Pennsylvania? Wisconsin? She’d romp in all of them. Unfortunately for her party, this woman no longer exists. She is Kirsten Gillibrand circa 2008, the days when she was a congresswoman representing New York’s largely rural 20th district. The 2018 Gillibrand has renounced all of these stances, moving left and left and left again. She supports the New New Deal that is today’s progressive economics (Medicare for all, a federal jobs guarantee, a $15 minimum wage) and says she “couldn’t have been more wrong” about her previous support for gun rights. By 2010, her first full year in the Senate, the NRA had altered its rating of her record — to an F. A decade ago Gillibrand was a strong supporter of Israel; these days she is writing hymns of praise in Time magazine for the far-left anti-Semitic activist Linda Sarsour. She was the only senator to vote against confirming James Mattis as secretary of defense. All of this now appears to be mere prelude to Gillibrand’s latest gambit: calling for extinguishing US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That puts her in a 31 percent minority among registered voters, according to a poll that followed a surge in not-so-great publicity for ICE. If 31 percent is all the support you can muster for abolishing ICE at a moment when the public image of same is “the child-caging agency,” you’d be better off arguing that the IRS should be put in charge of health care.

News article:
By Yochonon Donn NEW YORK — Rising Democratic star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez botched her first national interview Sunday night when she slammed Israel’s actions in Gaza before admitting she was not aware of the situation there. Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic socialist who has in the past said that Israel was committing a “massacre” in Gaza, was interviewed by PBS’s Firing Line. Margaret Hoover, the host, asked her for her thoughts on Israel. Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated top-ranking Rep. Joe Crowley in a major upset last month, referenced the Black Lives Matter movement and alleged police brutality in the U.S and her native Puerto Rico before circling back to Gaza. “I also think that what people are starting to see in the occupation of Palestine is just an increasing crisis of humanitarian conditions,” Ocasio-Cortez responded, “and that to me is just where I tend to come from on this issue.” Pressed on the term “occupation of Palestine” — there is no such country — Ocasio-Cortez struggled to give a coherent response. “I think what I meant,” she said, “is that the settlements that are increasing in some of these areas and places where Palestinians are experiencing difficulty in access to housing and homes.” “Do you think you can expand on that?” Hoover asked. “Yeah, I think (laughing) I am not the expert on geopolitics on this issue,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “You know, for me, I’m a firm believer in finding a two-state solution in this issue. And I’m happy to sit down with leaders on both of these. For me, I just look at things through a human-rights lens, and I may not use the right words.” She concluded with “I know this is a very intense issue.” The Simon Wiesenthal Center blasted her in a tweet, saying she “knows zero about 3,500 yr relationship of Jewish people to Land of Israel.” She also got blasted from the left by fellow socialists who said she offered “liberal platitudes about a two-state solution.” Conservative pundit Ben Shapiro tweeted: “If she were a Republican, she’d now be labeled stupid by every major media outlet in America. But she’s a democratic socialist, which is itself inherently stupid, so she will instead be given a free pass.” Ocasio-Cortez is considered a shoo-in for election in the heavily Democratic Queens district.

News article:
Roseanne Barr uploaded a one-minute video to her YouTube channel on Thursday in which she becomes increasingly frustrated. Barr is smoking a cigarette; an African fertility statue is situated behind her. When asked about the racist tweet she sent in May, where she compared former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to an ape, Barr lost her temper. "I'm trying to talk about Iran!" Barr, 65, said. "I'm trying to talk about Valerie Jarrett [writing] the Iran deal!" "I know," the interviewer replied. "You've told me this 300 times." "That's what my tweet was about!" "I know, you've explained this literally 300 times," the interviewer said. "I thought the bitch was white!" Barr screamed. "Goddammit! I thought the bitch was white!" Prior to that outburst, the anonymous interviewer told Barr to treat the video like a presidential address, in which the president is trying to save his job after a scandal. The video was released two weeks after Barr promised fans she would do a sit-down television interview. "To my wonderful fans who I treasure and love-who have carried me these past weeks when I was 2 weak 2 carry myself: I will be doing a TV interview this week. "I'll tell u about it tomorrow!" she tweeted July 8. A day later, Barr issued another tweet saying she would not, in fact, be making a return to television. "After a lot of thought, I decided that I won't be doing any TV interviews, too stressful & untrustworthy 4 me & my fans," she said. "I'm going to film it myself & post it on my youtube channel in the next week-the entire explanation of what happened & why! I love you all-sign up & get ready." Barr had apologized to Jarrett and said she'd been on Ambien when she wrote the tweet. She also claimed to be unaware that Jarrett is black and insisted the tweet was about anti-Semitism. "Rod Serling wrote Planet of the Apes. It was about anti-Semitism," Barr tweeted in June. "That is what my tweet referred to-the anti-Semitism of the Iran deal. Low IQ ppl can think whatever they want." After Barr's tweet about Jarrett, ABC quickly canceled the Roseanne reboot. The network will revive it as The Conners, without her.

"I know, you've explained this literally 300 times," the interviewer said. "I thought the bitch was white!" Barr screamed. "Goddammit! I thought the bitch was white!" Prior to that outburst, the anonymous interviewer told Barr to treat the video like a presidential address, in which the president is trying to save his job after a scandal. The video was released two weeks after Barr promised fans she would do a sit-down television interview. "To my wonderful fans who I treasure and love-who have carried me these past weeks when I was 2 weak 2 carry myself: I will be doing a TV interview this week. "I'll tell u about it tomorrow!" she tweeted July 8. A day later, Barr issued another tweet saying she would not, in fact, be making a return to television. "After a lot of thought, I decided that I won't be doing any TV interviews, too stressful & untrustworthy 4 me & my fans," she said. "I'm going to film it myself & post it on my youtube channel in the next week-the entire explanation of what happened & why! I love you all-sign up & get ready." Barr had apologized to Jarrett and said she'd been on Ambien when she wrote the tweet. She also claimed to be unaware that Jarrett is black and insisted the tweet was about anti-Semitism. "Rod Serling wrote Planet of the Apes. It was about anti-Semitism," Barr tweeted in June. "That is what my tweet referred to-the anti-Semitism of the Iran deal. Low IQ ppl can think whatever they want." After Barr's tweet about Jarrett, ABC quickly canceled the Roseanne reboot. The network will revive it as The Conners, without her.

News article:
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - The new face of an emerging democratic socialist movement joined its patriarch in the most unlikely place Friday, calling on Kansans unhappy with the direction of the country to get off the sidelines in a pivotal Republican-held congressional district. "We know that people in Kansas, just like everywhere else in this country, just like families in the Bronx, just want a fair shake," Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the surprise winner in a New York House primary last month, told a frenetic crowd of more than 3,000 in a Kansas suburb of Kansas City. Headlining a rally with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez sought to infuse the final weeks of Democrat Brent Welder's congressional primary campaign with the enthusiasm that lifted her over 20-year Democratic incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley last month. Kansas congressional candidate James Thompson, left, U.S Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic congressional candidate from New York, stand together on stage after a rally, Friday, July 20, 2018, in Wichita, Kan. (Jaime Green/The Wichita Eagle via AP) In an election year defined by energized Democratic voters seeking to send President Donald Trump a message, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez were betting they could stir up liberals in places where the left rarely competes. The 28-year-old Latina from New York and the 76-year-old Jewish senator from Vermont struck a stark contrast in the hotel ballroom, though they reflected the range of people in the racially and ethnically mixed crowd, weighted toward millennials but including gray-haired activists and parents with children. Their combined messages sought to unite not just the diverse group in the hall, but restless liberals around the country. "Whether you live in Kansas or Vermont or New York City, you want your children to have a decent life," Sanders said. "And yes, we have differences. But despite these huge differences, we have a hell of a lot more in common." Kansas, where Trump won by more than 20 percentage points in 2016, would seem inhospitable for a duo championing strikingly progressive positions such as universal, single-payer health care and government-paid tuition to public college. But Democrats see reasons for hope in a campaign year in which progressive candidates have won competitive primaries in GOP-leaning districts in suburban Philadelphia, metropolitan Omaha and Orange County, California, this year. Thirty-two-year-old registered nurse Kristen Burroughs said she'd grown tired of feeling locked out of representation in Kansas. "I wasn't sure when I'd have the chance to vote for someone this liberal in Kansas," Burroughs said, referring to Welder, a Sanders campaign activist and labor lawyer. Kansas' 3rd District, where Welder is competing, represented by four-term Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder, is on Democrats' target list as they aim to seize the GOP-controlled House in November. Nationally, the party must pick up at least 23 Republican-held seats to claim the House majority, and they are focusing on 25 districts where Clinton won, or Trump won narrowly. Democrats have been shut out of statewide and congressional races in Kansas since 2010. Earlier Friday, Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders headlined a rally in Wichita for Democrat James Thompson, a civil rights lawyer running in Kansas' 4th District. He also was an activist for Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign. Sherri Lower, a 67-year-old retired emergency medical technician, showed up at the Wichita rally wearing a t-shirt that read: "We Care. We Vote. Do You?" "This is the most important year we've ever had, and Thompson is one of our main guys," Lower said. "I want Democrats to go out and vote." But Democrats have higher hopes in the 3rd District, one of only a handful Democrat Hillary Clinton won in the general election and Sanders won in the presidential nominating caucuses. Republicans in the 3rd District outnumber their Democratic counterparts by more than 50,000, while unaffiliated voters also edge Democrats. Republicans outnumber Democrats by 2-to-1 in the 4th District. Liberals argue that they are not just convincing moderate Democrats or disaffected Republicans but also engaging new primary voters, as Ocasio-Cortez did in New York this summer and as Sanders did in his insurgent 2016 presidential campaign. While the Kansas campaign swing created a lot of buzz, Republicans were skeptical it would help Democrats make inroads in a conservative state. State Rep. Tom Cox, a moderate Kansas City-area Republican, said there are pockets of liberal Democrats in the Kansas City suburbs but questioned whether Sanders' message will resonate more broadly. He said Democrats tend to be split between liberals and moderates, with some union members and supporters holding conservative views on social issues. "Even our Democrats around here are not socialist democrats," he said. "If someone would describe the 3rd District, I would say center right." Leading candidates in the Democratic primary for governor have said their party must rebuild its brand in rural, heavily GOP areas. And despite surging energy among lefist Democrats in the Trump era, it was unclear if there were enough votes in the 3rd District for a liberal Democrat to win. Before Yoder won in 2010, it had been held for 12 years by centrist Democrat Dennis Moore, who relied on moderate Republicans during his tenure. Yet Sanders and his brand of liberalism have proved popular. He won more than two-thirds of the votes in the state's 2016 presidential caucuses, surpassing Barack Obama's 2008 vote total. And Ocasio-Cortez said it can be done in Kansas by broadening the electorate to include previously less active voters, rather than trying to convert moderates. "It is going to take every single person in this room knocking on 10, 50, 100 doors apiece," she said. "So, if you have never knocked on a door before, I am talking to you." ___ Hegeman contributed reporting Wichita, Kansas. Correspondent John Hanna contributed from Topeka, Kansas.

Ron Desantis, a Republican in the House of Representatives and a candidate for Governor of Florida took aim at political newcomer and rising progressive star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a campaign event Saturday. "You look at this girl Ocasio-Cortez, or whatever she is, I mean, she's in a totally different universe," he said during the event in Orange Park, as first reported by the Huffington Post. "It's basically socialism wrapped in ignorance." Ocasio-Cortez responded to Desantis's comments on Twitter Monday with the statement: "Rep DeSantis, it seems you're confused as to 'whatever I am.' I am a Puerto Rican woman. It's strange you don't know what that is, given that ~75,000 Puerto Ricans have relocated to Florida in the 10 mos since Maria," she said. "But I'm sure these new FL voters appreciate your comments!" Rep DeSantis, it seems you‘re confused as to “whatever I am.” I am a Puerto Rican woman. It‘s strange you don’t know what that is, given that ~75,000 Puerto Ricans have relocated to Florida in the 10 mos since María. But I’m sure these new FL voters appreciate your comments! https://t.co/xJlroSe5Hs — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 23, 2018 Ocasio- Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist from New York, rocketed into the national political scene last month after she beat high-ranking Congressman Joe Crowley in a Democratic primary win that saw her progressive message resonate with constituents. "The only time we create any kind of substantive change is when we reach out to a disaffected electorate and inspire and motivate them to vote," Ocasio Cortez told In These Times, a progressive magazine last month. "That is how Obama won and got re-elected, and that's how Bernie Sanders did so well." Desantis'z criticism of Ocasio-Cortez centered around an interview she did with PBS News earlier this month in which she described Israel's presence in the West Bank as an "occupation." "There's never been a Palestinian state. You're just repeating these canned, left-wing talking points, and you're somehow the savior of the Democratic Party? Good lord," Desantis said. "She has no clue what she's talking about." Desantis did not immediately respond to Newsweek's request for comment on his statements. DeSantis' website describes him as a politician who has "helped drain the swamp." He leads the Republican race for governor by a 12 point margin over Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, according to a Politico poll. In June, Trump endorsed Densantis on Twitter and said he would make a "great governor." "Congressman Ron DeSantis, a top student at Yale and Harvard Law School, is running for Governor of the Great State of Florida. Ron is strong on Borders, tough on Crime & big on Cutting Taxes- Loves our Military & our Vets," he said. "He will be a Great Governor & has my full Endorsement!"

News article:
NEW YORK (JTA)—Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez decried the “occupation of Palestine” during a television interview. Appearing July 13 on PBS’s “Firing Line,” Ocasio-Cortez, 28, also described herself as “a firm believer in finding a two-state solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, upset 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley in last month’s primary in New York’s 14th Congressional District, which straddles Queens and the Bronx. Although she has commented infrequently on foreign affairs, in May she called the killing of Palestinian protesters by Israeli troops at the Gaza fence a “massacre.” On “Firing Line,” host Margaret Hoover asked Ocasio-Cortez “What is your position on Israel?” Ocasio-Cortez responded, “I believe absolutely in Israel’s right to exist” She added: “I am a proponent of a two-state solution.” The candidate said her previous position on the Gaza clashes “is not a referendum on the State of Israel.” “The lens through which I saw this incident, as an activist, as an organizer – if 60 people were killed in Ferguson, Missouri, if 60 people were killed in the South Bronx, unarmed, if 60 people were killed in Puerto Rico – I just look at that [Gaza] incident more through just, as an incident, and to me, it would just be completely unacceptable if that happened on our shores,” she said. “Of course the dynamics there, in terms of geopolitics... is very different than people expressing their First Amendment right to protest,” Hoover replied. Israel and its supporters have noted that among those killed in Gaza were members of the Hamas terrorist group, which encouraged its followers to breach the border fence. Hamas has acknowledged that at that May demonstration, 50 of the 61 killed were its members. “Yes,” Ocasio-Cortez conceded, adding, “But I also think that what people are starting to see at least in the occupation... of Palestine [is] just an increasing crisis of humanitarian condition and that to me is just where I tend to come from on this issue.” When Hoover, a former aide to President George W. Bush, asked Ocasio-Cortez to clarify what she meant, Ocasio-Cortez paused and answered: “I think what I meant is like the settlements that are increasing in some of these areas in places where Palestinians are experiencing difficulty in access to their housing and homes.” After Hoover asked Ocasio-Cortez to expand on her comments, the candidate said: “I am not the expert on geopolitics on this issue,” and “I just look at things through a human rights lens and I may not use the right words... Middle Eastern politics is not exactly at my kitchen table every night.” Her comments on Israel have prompted criticism from the right and left. “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is doing a great service. Her argument is twofold: Israel a colonizing occupier of Palestine, and that she doesn’t know anything about the conflict,” wrote Seth Mandel, op-ed editor of the New York Post, on Twitter. “Accurate: those who think this have no idea what they’re talking about. At least she’s honest.” The Republican Jewish Coalition tweeted: “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bashes Israel while admitting she is clueless about what is going on there. She simply toes the far-left, radical agenda. Elected Democrats are endorsing this when they endorse her.” Asad Abukhalil, a professor in political science at California State University, Stanislaus, lamented that Ocasio-Cortez’s comments about a two-state solution and support for Israel’s right to exist are “a sign that you have become an already mainstream Democratic candidate.” “’Israel’s right to exist’ is a euphemism for Israel’s right to occupy Palestine,” Abukhalil added. “@Ocasio2018 should have known that.” Although the Democratic Socialists of America endorses the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, Ocasio-Cortez has not discussed her position on the boycott. Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has called Ocasio-Cortez the “future of our party.”

News article:
Roseanne Barr maintained during a free-wheeling interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday night that her tweet going after former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett was political and not racist. ABC canceled Barr’s eponymous sitcom, “Roseanne,” in May after she tweeted that Jarrett, who is black and was born in Iran to American parents, looked like the offspring of the “Muslim Brotherhood & Planet of the Apes.” {mosads}Barr insisted on Thursday that her comments were not intended to be racist, but were instead political. She described her shock when she first found out that the tweet had been interpreted as a racial epithet. “The first thing was shock that they were saying it was racial when it was politics,” she told Hannity. “And that was a hard one to take.” “And then everyone started saying I was a racist, which is the worst thing you could call a Jewish person,” she continued. At one point during the interview Thursday, Barr appeared to speak directly to Jarrett, saying that she was sorry that her tweet made the former senior Obama aide “feel harmed and hurt.” But she also insisted that her comment was misunderstood. “Valerie, let’s discuss this,” Barr said. “Don’t assume you know what I meant, because I think you don’t know what I meant, and I would like to make it clearer to you what I did mean.” But she also added in the interview: “I would tell her she needs a new haircut.” Throughout the wide-ranging interview, Barr repeatedly said that her tweet was misinterpreted. She said the comment was meant to ask for “accountability from the previous administration about the Iran deal, which Valerie Jarrett is the author of, and that was what was in my head.” Barr, a staunch supporter of President Trump, also insisted that she was politically moderate and that extreme views on the left and right had “marginalized the middle.” She acknowledged that her comment about Jarrett was a mistake. But also said that she had been wrongly villainized in the media. “I made a mistake obviously. It cost me everything. My life’s work. Everything,” she said. “I made a mistake.” Jarrett, who in May called Barr’s controversial tweets a “teaching moment” about racism, brushed off questions this week about her, saying the controversy doesn’t keep her up at night. “Roseanne who?” Jarrett said on ABC’s “The View,” adding, “In all seriousness … I’m fine.”

News article:
New York Congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez explained to “The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah on Thursday night what it means to be a Democratic Socialist – and she didn’t shy away from the polarizing label. Noah kicked off the interview by congratulating Ocasio-Cortez on being a “dream” for half the country and a “nightmare” for the other half since her shock victory over veteran congressman Joe Crowley in the Democratic primary. “I’ll take it,” Ocasio-Cortez said. Noah said the term “Democratic Socialist” has newfound weight coinciding with Ocasio-Cortez’s rise to fame and asked what the she wants people to think when they hear the term that is rejected by many Americans. “We live in a society that is capable, we are capable of insuring that we have basic frameworks where people can be covered by health insurance, can send their kids to college, where we can pursue a very bold action on climate change and save our future and is part of a moral and ethical economy,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “I believe we are morally obliged to pursue it.” Noah then asked if she has considered taking the term “socialist” out of her label, while keeping her current platform, because the word is so polarizing. Ocasio-Cortez said the socialist label is “something the media cares more about” and she is simply being genuine. “I don’t knock on a person’s door and is like, ‘Hey, let me tell you about socialism,’ Like, that’s not how I campaign,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “And I also think that I don’t knock on a person’s door and say, ‘Hey, let me tell you about being a Democrat.’ No, I don’t say that. I speak to people’s needs.” Noah then asked who would pay for all of the free things that Ocasio-Cortez wants to give out “This is an excellent, excellent question,” she fired back. “I sat down with a Nobel Prize economist last week, I can’t believe I can say that, it’s really weird, but one of the things that we saw is if people pay their fair share… if corporations and the ultra-wealthy… as Warren Buffet likes to say, if he paid as much as his secretary paid, 15 percent. If he paid a 15 percent tax rate… if we raised our corporate tax rate to 28 percent… if we do those two things, and also close some of those loopholes, that’s two trillion dollars right there.” I don’t knock on a person’s door and is like, ‘Hey, let me tell you about socialism’ — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Ocasio-Cortez said a “carbon tax” and “reprioritization” would be necessary to generate additional revenue needed for her socialist agenda. She also suggested taking funds away from the military as part of what she called reprioritizing. “Healthcare is important enough for us to put first,” she said. “Education is important enough for us to put first.” Ocasio-Cortez said it will require “political and moral courage” to accomplish her goals. She has emerged as a liberal darling since bursting onto the scene – but not everyone is a fan. Comedian Lewis Black, who also considers himself a socialist, told The Daily Beast that Ocasio-Cortez is not the answer during a recent interview. “The one thing I’ve learned in my lifetime is that we’ve got to get to the middle before we start pushing things in other directions. We’ve gotta get to the middle, and they have to sit down and decide how to do things,” Black said when asked if Ocasio-Cortez provides a “glimmer of hope.”

If he paid a 15 percent tax rate… if we raised our corporate tax rate to 28 percent… if we do those two things, and also close some of those loopholes, that’s two trillion dollars right there.” I don’t knock on a person’s door and is like, ‘Hey, let me tell you about socialism’ — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Ocasio-Cortez said a “carbon tax” and “reprioritization” would be necessary to generate additional revenue needed for her socialist agenda. She also suggested taking funds away from the military as part of what she called reprioritizing. “Healthcare is important enough for us to put first,” she said. “Education is important enough for us to put first.” Ocasio-Cortez said it will require “political and moral courage” to accomplish her goals. She has emerged as a liberal darling since bursting onto the scene – but not everyone is a fan. Comedian Lewis Black, who also considers himself a socialist, told The Daily Beast that Ocasio-Cortez is not the answer during a recent interview. “The one thing I’ve learned in my lifetime is that we’ve got to get to the middle before we start pushing things in other directions. We’ve gotta get to the middle, and they have to sit down and decide how to do things,” Black said when asked if Ocasio-Cortez provides a “glimmer of hope.”

Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey on Monday endorsed progressive congressional candidate Ayanna Pressley. Pressley, the first woman of color elected to the Boston City Council, is taking on Rep. Michael Capuano (D), who has held the seat for almost 20 years. “Today, I’m endorsing Ayanna Pressley to be the next Congresswoman representing my district, the historic 7th District of Massachusetts,” Healey tweeted. “For me, this isn’t political, it’s personal.” “Long before I ever thought of running for office, Ayanna Pressley and I worked together on issues that strike at the core of who we are as a city and a state and reflect the progress we still need to make,” Healey wrote in a second tweet.

A recent poll showed Pressley within single digits of Capuano, though 33 percent of voters said they were still undecided. The primary is scheduled for Sept. 4.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) fielded questions about her 2020 plans on Friday during an appearance at a historically black college, where she emphasized a renewed focus on political activism after President Trump’s election. Speaking at Dillard University in New Orleans, Warren was asked what may have changed since she opted not to run for president in 2016, The Associated Press reported. {mosads} “Two words: Donald Trump,” Warren responded during a Q&A panel hosted by Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. Warren then shifted to discussing other topics including the upcoming midterm elections in November, saying they are an opportunity to halt the president’s agenda in Congress. Warren gets a question about why she didn’t run in 2016 and whether anything has changed since then. “Two words: Donald Trump.” But she then pivots to attacking the Kavanaugh nomination. — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) August 3, 2018 The Massachusetts senator is among several Senate Democrats widely viewed as potential candidates during the next White House race. Warren, 69, is up for reelection to her Senate seat this year and had told reporters in April that she planned to serve her full six-year term if reelected in November. “I am not running for president of the United States. That’s my plan,” Warren said at the time. Warren, a progressive firebrand, is considered a top potential Democratic contender in 2020, along with fellow Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). Warren was one of several potential candidates, including Booker and Harris, who spoke at the progressive Netroots Nation conference in New Orleans this week. The annual gathering has been a top speaking spot for past Democratic contenders, including former President Obama and Sanders during his 2016 bid. Also speaking at Netroots Nation this week was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D), the self-described democratic socialist who won a surprise victory over longtime Rep. Joseph Crowley (N.Y.), the No. 4 House Democrat, in a Democratic primary in New York in June.

News article:
Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro challenged Democratic House candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to a debate on Wednesday and offered $10,000 for her campaign if she accepted the challenge. In a segment on “The Ben Shapiro Show,” he noted that Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez has called Ocasio-Cortez “the future of the party.” “Miss Ocasio-Cortez, I’m really excited that you’ve been elevated to that position and I would love to have a real conversation with you about the issues,” Shapiro said. “You’ve noted that you think Republicans are afraid to debate you or talk to you or discuss the issues with you. Not only am I eager to discuss the issues with you, I’m willing to offer $10,000 to your campaign today for you to come on our Sunday special,” he continued. Ocasio-Cortez, 28, a former staffer on Bernie Sanders’s (I-Vt.) 2016 presidential campaign, shocked the political world by upsetting 10-term Democratic Rep. Joseph Crowley in the primary for New York’s 14th Congressional District. Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist, ran on a platform that includes “Medicare for all” and tuition-free public college education. Shapiro’s offer came after Ocasio-Cortez appeared for an interview on “Pod Save America,” a podcast hosted by former Obama administration staffers. Shapiro, who has become a leading voice for conservative millennials, offered Ocasio-Cortez one hour for a debate to discuss “all the topics under the sun” in an effort to probe “her belief system.” “I would love to debate her because I have one question for her,” Shapiro continued later. “Name an industry you would not nationalize; which ones should the government not run and why? Alright, can she name any of them?” Shapiro also offered to donate the money to charity instead of the campaign. “So let’s make this happen! Let’s make America a more civil and interesting place. Let’s do this thing,” he concluded. Ocasio-Cortez has not responded to Shapiro’s offer as of Thursday morning.

News article:
Democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – the New York congressional candidate many in the media have fallen in love with – was handed rejection when many of the candidates she endorsed lost in Tuesday’s elections. But her radical and totally impractical ideas continue to pose a threat. The 28-year-old candidate advocates for guaranteed federal jobs, free college for all, Medicare for all, and the abolishment of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. She’d like to turn Uncle Sam into Santa Claus, handing out freebies 365 days a year – all paid for by crushing taxes on all of us, a skyrocketing national debt or … hey, whatever. The surprising primary victory that turned this grossly unqualified and woefully uninformed young woman into a candidate likely to be elected to Congress in a heavily Democratic district shows that the real battleground this election cycle is in the classroom. If we continue to laugh off Ocasio-Cortez as an ignorant and delusional radical, we will be blindsided by the soon-to-be largest voting bloc in America – a generation of indoctrinated millennials. As a fellow millennial, I know firsthand that Ocasio-Cortez’s college experience probably taught her that being a socialist absolves her of knowing much at all. All she needs to know is that anyone who opposes her is evil. And she needs to memorize a few bumper sticker slogans about the cruel and greedy 1 percent who aren't “paying their fair share.” Ocasio-Cortez is among the majority of millennials who now say they would prefer to live in a socialist or communist country over a capitalist one. That’s a troubling revelation to older generations. But can young people be blamed for having no memory of the widespread failures of socialism and communism if we never learned about them? Each year, more and more schools are doing away with basic economics and history courses and replacing them with anti-American, progressive propaganda. A survey by U.S. News & World Report found that 53 out of the 76 “best” colleges and universities in America no longer require history majors to take a single course on U.S. history. Meanwhile, the Communist Manifesto is among the three most frequently assigned readings at American universities and Karl Marx is the most studied economist. Never mind that his economic ideas make about as much sense as the economic theories of Groucho Marx. Campuses across the country are creating a breeding ground for an entire generation of socialist-embracing voters. The University of Massachusetts currently offers a course on “resistance” to capitalism. California State University recently held a “teach-in” charging that America was "built on a racist capitalist system, meant to weaken the minority." At Ocasio-Cortez’s alma mater, Boston University, only three out of the 49 outside speakers invited to the campus last year were identifiably conservative. This is the same school that hosted a panel on the premise that Israel and America are “fascist states.” It's almost as if Ocasio-Cortez used those panel notes to prepare for her cringe-worthy “Firing Line” interview , where she slammed Israel as an oppressor and then backtracked in embarrassment when asked to elaborate. "I’m not the expert on geopolitics on this issue," admitted the recent college graduate. No argument on that point. In fact, Ocasio-Cortez is “not the expert” on most of the issues she will have to deal with when she likely becomes a member of the U.S. House of Representatives in January. But did anyone expect her to be? Today’s college students spend an average of just under three hours a day on education-related activities. They are learning significantly less than college students did years ago, and the little that they do learn is taught through a progressive lens that often gives them a warped perspective of reality. They learn how to memorize talking points and slogans – but if you ask them to dive in and explain what they’re saying they can’t, because there’s no substance. So long as they are virtuously fighting the hateful and the cruel, their grades remain high and they are never challenged to explain the validity of their opinions. As a result, we see an entire generation quick to adopt socialism, but slow to define what it is or what it looks like throughout history. They’re simply clueless. “I think my strength is I’m honest and authentic,” Ocasio-Cortez told “The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah. To understand the mind of a millennial is to understand that he or she believes virtues like these absolve you from needing to possess any real knowledge. This is why we see radical ideas that fall apart on close examination becoming mainstream. The problem is that the millennials never give socialism a close examination. Universities have been held unaccountable for far too long and their agenda is now coming to fruition on a national platform. In 2016, a Cornell University history professor was filmed telling students that “capitalism is an anti-human system,” and then urging them to build a grassroots movement to “defeat capitalism altogether because it’s not going to happen at the ballot box.” Fast-forward two years to Ocasio-Cortez’s upset primary victory over 10-term incumbent Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in New York and you find that it is in fact happening at the ballot box. This should be a wake-up call for Americans to stop writing off millennials as a hopeless generation of bleeding-heart Bernie-lovers. With a continuation of far-far left indoctrination in our schools and colleges, the American Dream might be replaced by a nightmare. Crazy as it sounds, some people are even talking about Ocasio-Cortez running for president someday. Will America put her in the White House with the slogan “Make America Socialist?” If the majority of millennials truly embrace socialism, candidates like Ocasio-Cortez are only one successful voter registration drive away from getting elected to our highest offices. And if that happens, we and future generations will get to experience the nightmare of economic failure and lack of freedom that the citizens of Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela, the Soviet Union, East Germany and other socialist and communist states have suffered through.

News article:
New York Congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who identifies as a Democratic-Socialist, has faced increased media scrutiny and a number of high-profile attacks from both Republicans and establishment Democrats since beating 10-term incumbent Congressman Joe Crowley in her district's primary last month. In a publicity stunt, right-wing commentator Ben Shapiro, who is not running for office, offered the 28-year-old $10,000 to debate him publically, then used her refusal as an excuse to retweet his fans, saying he would "destroy her intellectually." In July, Trump-backed Florida gubernatorial candidate Representative Ron DeSantis referred to Ocasio-Cortez as a "girl…or whatever she is," to a laughing crowd during a campaign event. Former Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman penned an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal asking Democrats to consider voting for Representative Joe Crowley despite his primary loss. Since winning her election, Ocasio-Cortez has embarked on a national media tour with the goal of elevating other progressive candidates. In so doing, the candidate has opened herself to criticism by using sweeping terms to describe complicated ideas and sometimes showing a misunderstanding of the way governmental agencies work. In an interview with The Intercept in May, Ocasio-Coretz seemed to buy into the myth that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every night. "ICE is the only criminal investigative agency, the only enforcement agency in the United States, that has a bed quota," she said. "So ICE is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night, and that number has only been increasing since 2009." Between 2009 and 2016, ICE was required to have 34,000 beds ready each night but not to fill them, according to former Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson. That requirement was eliminated as of 2017. Ocasio-Cortez also made some claims about the middle class that didn't add up. "Unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs," she said on PBS's Firing Line this July. "Unemployment is low because people are working 60, 70, 80 hours a week and can barely feed their family." According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the number of people working two jobs has remained at about 5 percent since 2010, and has slowly been receding from its 1996 peak of 6.2 percent. The BLS also found that on average, laborers at private companies worked 35 hours a week, not 60 to 80. In an August interview with Pod Save America, Ocasio-Cortez said that "this upper-middle class is probably more moderate, but that upper-middle class does not exist anymore in America." The upper-middle class in America is actually growing. According to a 2016 Urban Institute Study, the wealth strata actually increased from from 12.9 percent of the American population in 1979 to 29.4 percent of the population in 2014. Ocasio-Cortez is far from the only candidate or elected official to make factual errors or exaggerate the truth during interviews with the press. But as The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler pointed out Friday morning in a fact-check, "With celebrity comes scrutiny. Ocasio-Cortez has come under fire for dismissing concerns about the anticipated costs of her proposals and offering too-glib answers." Requests for response from the Ocasio-Cortez campaign were not immediately answered.

News article:
New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has excited the liberal base with her media blitz touting Medicare-for-all, the elimination of ICE and more. But the Democrat's rapid-fire claims about the state of the economy and other issues have fact-checkers scrambling to provide a reality check. The Washington Post was the latest to put her myriad claims under the microscope. The newspaper took issue, for instance, with her claim that unemployment is low “because everyone has two jobs.” The Post shot this down, noting the number of people working two jobs is down from the recession -- and has remained steady at around 5 percent in recent years. Other claims it summarily dismissed include a May 30 interview statement that ICE is “required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night.” Both the Post and Politifact note that this is an “urban legend” and that ICE was only required to maintain that many beds -- not fill them. Additionally, the Post called her out for saying a recent study found Medicare-for-all would cut health expenditures, when it found the plan would raise government expenditures by $32.6 trillion over 10 years. A separate fact check by The Associated Press aimed at this claim, made by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., notes it only cuts spending if hospitals accept Medicare-based payments of 40 percent less for those who have private insurance. Some claims didn’t warrant a check, including one appearance on CNN where she asked, “Why aren’t we incorporating the cost of all the funeral expenses of those who died because they can’t afford access to health care?” “Huh?” was the only response from the Post’s fact-checkers. Ocasio-Cortez has been on the interview circuit ever since her shock primary victory over Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y. But the 28-year-old swiftly encountered some difficulties, starting with her interview with PBS’ “Firing Line,” in which she went in hot on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and talked about the “occupation of Palestine.” Asked to “expand” on her thoughts, she said, “I am not the expert at geopolitics on this issue.” OCASIO-CORTEZ STARTS CONTROVERSY WITH COMMENTS ON ISRAELI 'OCCUPATION,' ADMITS SHE'S 'NOT THE EXPERT' Less than two weeks later, in an appearance on “The Daily Show,” the candidate made a number of questionable statements on how she would pay for her big spending agenda.

News article:
New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has excited the liberal base with her media blitz touting Medicare-for-all, the elimination of ICE and more. But the Democrat's rapid-fire claims about the state of the economy and other issues have fact-checkers scrambling to provide a reality check. The Washington Post was the latest to put her myriad claims under the microscope. The newspaper took issue, for instance, with her claim that unemployment is low “because everyone has two jobs.” The Post shot this down, noting the number of people working two jobs is down from the recession -- and has remained steady at around 5 percent in recent years. Other claims it summarily dismissed include a May 30 interview statement that ICE is “required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night.” Both the Post and Politifact note that this is an “urban legend” and that ICE was only required to maintain that many beds -- not fill them. Additionally, the Post called her out for saying a recent study found Medicare-for-all would cut health expenditures, when it found the plan would raise government expenditures by $32.6 trillion over 10 years. A separate fact check by The Associated Press aimed at this claim, made by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., notes it only cuts spending if hospitals accept Medicare-based payments of 40 percent less for those who have private insurance. Some claims didn’t warrant a check, including one appearance on CNN where she asked, “Why aren’t we incorporating the cost of all the funeral expenses of those who died because they can’t afford access to health care?” “Huh?” was the only response from the Post’s fact-checkers. Ocasio-Cortez has been on the interview circuit ever since her shock primary victory over Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y. But the 28-year-old swiftly encountered some difficulties, starting with her interview with PBS’ “Firing Line,” in which she went in hot on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and talked about the “occupation of Palestine.” Asked to “expand” on her thoughts, she said, “I am not the expert at geopolitics on this issue.” OCASIO-CORTEZ STARTS CONTROVERSY WITH COMMENTS ON ISRAELI 'OCCUPATION,' ADMITS SHE'S 'NOT THE EXPERT' Less than two weeks later, in an appearance on “The Daily Show,” the candidate made a number of questionable statements on how she would pay for her big spending agenda. "Just last year we gave the military a $700 billion dollar budget increase, which they didn’t even ask for,” she said. “They were like, ‘we don’t want another fighter jet. Don’t give us another nuclear bomb.’ They didn’t even ask for it. And we gave it to them." This caught the eye of Politfact, which gave her a “false” rating, noting that the $700 billion tag was the total defense budget for 2018, not the increase, and that the amount was “more than the Defense Department settled in negotiations for Trump’s budget request ($668 billion), but exactly what they requested in their annual wishlist to Congress.” Ocasio-Cortez has been pushing back against the critics.

News article:
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, pictured with her husband Richard and daughter Gabriella, has been in an Iranian prison for more than two years Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman who has been in prison in Tehran for more than two years following a conviction for sedition, was freed for three days on Thursday. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was reunited with members of her family including her young daughter outside the Iranian capital after her surprise release. "Nazanin was released from Evin prison on furlough this morning. Initially the release is for three days -- her lawyer is hopeful this can be extended," her husband Richard Ratcliffe said in a statement. Ratcliffe said his wife, who has denied all charges filed against her in Iran, was currently with her parents and their four-year-old daughter Gabriella in Damavand, a mountain resort near Tehran. "I cried so much. I felt so overwhelmed," she said of the reunion, according to a statement released by The Free Nazanin campaign, which is run by her husband. Her husband voiced thanks to those in Tehran and London involved in making the release happen, including Britain's new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. "This was a very happy surprise after a number of false dawns recently, which had been increasingly unsettling," her husband said. Hunt, who met Ratcliffe in London earlier this month after he was appointed as Britain's top diplomat in July, called her temporary release "really good news" and paid tribute to the "tireless campaigning by husband Richard and her friends". "But being in prison AT ALL is gross injustice and she must be PERMANENTLY released for which every effort will continue," he wrote on Twitter. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works for the Thomson Reuters Foundation -- the media organisation's philanthropic arm -- was arrested at Tehran airport in April 2016. She is serving a five-year jail sentence for sedition -- a charge she has always contested. Hunt's predecessor Boris Johnson came under heavy criticism after appearing to jeopardise her defence last year by saying she was training journalists during her visit -- something her employer and family strongly deny. Johnson later clarified his remarks, saying it was clear that she was only on holiday. Campaigners have staged protests to demand the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe Ratcliffe and his supporters have held multiple protests and vigils in London to seek her release, attracting celebrity support from the likes of Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson. - 'Had to borrow a phone' - The Free Nazanin campaign said she was told on Thursday she had just 10 minutes to get ready because she was being released. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was not allowed to call her family and had to borrow a phone from someone outside the prison to call her brother, who lives in Tehran, to pick her up. She then called her husband and the British embassy and travelled to join the rest of her Iranian family, including her grandmother and daughter, in Damavand. "I wasn't expecting it at all when it was mentioned two weeks ago," she was quoted as saying by the campaign. "I didn't tell Gabriella or for a long time my mum -- so if it didn't happen I would be the only one to suffer." Zaghari-Ratcliffe was told she must return to prison on Sunday and the two conditions of her release are that she not give any media interviews or visit the grounds of any foreign embassy. Bail for her temporary release was set at one billion rials ($23,800, 20,600 euros), with her family's home in Tehran used as collateral, the campaign said. Zaghari-Ratcliffe's lawyers will on Saturday ask the authorities to extend her furlough, it added. "Nazanin has a number of cellmates who were released initially for three days, but who are still on furlough over a month later," the campaign statement said.

News article:
Also known by such names as the Great Tehran Penitentiary, Tehran Central Prison, and Hassanabad-Qom Prison, Fashafuyeh Prison is located approximately 32 km south of Tehran. Accusations of human rights abuses have been leveled at Fashafuyeh Prison since it was created in 2012. According to Fatourechi, “Drawing attention to conditions of the ‘ordinary prisoners’ in Fashafuyeh is an urgent and immediate necessity. No one in Iran is more oppressed and vulnerable. They exist in the epitome of ‘inhumane conditions’ and are victims of a twofold oppression. To bear this, even for one day, is beyond the power of the human spirit and will undoubtedly cause permanent trauma to their body and soul. Every day, the number of cases like these only multiply.” Looking back at the prison quarantine that he and every other new prisoner endures for some four days, he writes, “Among inmates, the colloquial name for the quarantine ward is Hell… The prisoners said the difference in living conditions between the tip and quarantine wards are analogous to those between a bedroom and a toilet.” This wasn’t the first time Fatourechi experienced Fashafuyeh Prison’s quarantine. In his comparison of the current conditions with his previous experiences, he writes, “Having witnessed the quarantine ward on three different occasions in the 90s and 2000s, I can definitively corroborate their accounts of how ‘grave’ the conditions in Fashafuyeh’s quarantine ward really are.” He explains, “In a routine four-day quarantine period, the prisoner, regardless of crime or sentence, is deprived of potable water, ventilation, toilets, cigarettes, and digestible food (there is cold, half-baked pasta, and cold, uncooked yellow rice).” His describes the quarantine area, “The toilet is a hole on the floor of a 2 foot by 2 foot area, without light or running water, separated by a curtain from the ward’s beds and 10 foot by 10 foot cells, known as Physicals, that house between 26 and 32 prisoners. The living conditions in the physicals are so inhumane that quarantined inmates call them the Exile.” He continues, “Quarantine cells have three-tier bunk beds and two blankets spread on the floor. Two glassless skylights are all they have to regulate temperature. There is no running water between 4 p.m. and 7 a.m., and the only light glows from a 100-watt fluorescent bulb. Should it burn out, the prisoners say, only God could make someone replace it.” There is an “incredible daily influx of new prisoners” Fatourechi says. “Every 24 hours or so, more than 40 new prisoners are brought to the quarantine ward, while a maximum of ten [prisoners] leave the ward each day.” He adds that “more than 80 percent of the quarantine inmates are intravenous drug addicts and homeless people unable to stand on their own feet who belong in a hospital, not a prison.” The detainees unlucky enough to have a bunk — the “floor sleepers” — are usually “Afghans and intravenous addicts” writes Fatourechi, and they are “similar to those in coffins, the coffin-sized cells reserved for political prisoners in the 1980s that were barely large enough to lie down in.” He writes that the “floor sleepers” are sometimes “pushed to spending the night beneath the beds of other inmates. Coined as ‘coffin sleepers’, it is typical for other inmates to sit on the floor next to their sleeping enclosure, restraining their movement and blocking their access to light and air.” Additionally, “The stench of sweat and infected wounds is unbelievable. Many inmates are detoxing from drug addictions and are in no state to be taken to the so-called ‘bathroom’ to wash up, which thickens the stench.” “Drug addicts, theft convicts, ‘dirty ones’ and Afghans are treated like livestock from the moment they step foot in the ward.” The situation of the poor families of the inmates Fatourechi describes as, “Another deplorable element of Fashafuyeh…” He writes that, “Families of prisoners sit in the desert outside, and no one knows who is incarcerated in the prison (either that or they don’t reveal to the families what they know). This is critical when Fashafuyeh prisoners come from poor families who can only come by taxi, at a cost between 1-1.5 million rials,” which is approximately $10 to $15 USD.

News article:
Two leading theater figures in Iran have been arrested over a trailer for Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” featuring men and women dancing together, a government official said Monday. Prominent director Maryam Kazemi and venue manager Saeed Asadi were detained on Sunday on the orders of the judiciary, said Shahram Karami of the ministry of culture and Islamic guidance, according to the semi-official news agency ISNA. Advertisement Karami, who heads the ministry’s performing arts department, said the “type of music played” and the actors’ “movements” were the main problem with the trailer, which was widely shared on social media. Men and women are banned from dancing together in Iran. Kazemi and Asadi were ordered to post bail of three billion rials (roughly $23,000 at the current unofficial rate) each, and were due to be released from detention on Tuesday, according to state news agency IRNA. The play had already been showing for seven nights at City Theatre, one of Tehran’s most famous venues, and only had one night left to run when the pair were arrested. “The issue was with the trailer they released and not the play’s content,” Karami added.

Iran environment head seeks answers on detained activists Bourse and Bazaar | AFP – Iran’s vice-president in charge of environmental affairs has called for an explanation on the fate of more than a dozen activists arrested this year, state news agency IRNA reported Sunday. “We are not asking for their release or for their execution, we just want their fate to be clarified. This is part of their citizenship rights,” Isa Kalantari, who heads Iran’s environment department, told IRNA. “This was supposed to have happened by the end of this summer but their trial hasn’t even started yet,” he added. Iran has arrested at least a dozen environmental activists since January on charges of spying for foreign intelligence agencies, but few details have been released. One of them, Kavous Seyed Emami, a 63-year-old professor and renowned environmentalist, allegedly committed suicide in prison in February, a fortnight after his arrest. The judiciary has prepared indictments against five of the detainees, according to state media, but a court date has yet to be set. “We have cited the intelligence minister that these activists are not spies, and that the ministry is the sole official authority on whether someone is a spy,” Kalantari said. In May, Mahmoud Sadeghi, a reformist member of parliament, also tweeted that the intelligence ministry had not found any proof that the environmentalists were spies. Iran’s judiciary, however, considers itself as the only authority on settling the question of spying and has warned other bodies not to interfere.

(Adds background, details) GENEVA, Sept 12 (Reuters) - A Iranian former vice president was sentenced to six and a half years in prison on Wednesday for threatening national security and other charges, the Tasnim news agency reported. Esfandiar Rahim Mashaie was sentenced to five years for threatening national security, one year for spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic and six months for insulting judiciary officials, according to Tasnim. Rahim Mashaie has long been a lightning rod for criticism from Iran's hardliners, in part because of a 2008 comment that the Islamic Republic is friendly with the people of its sworn foe Israel. When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appointed Rahim Mashaie as his vice president in 2009, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, objected. Ahmadinejad then appointed Rahim Mashaie, whose daughter is married to Ahmadinejad's son, as chief of staff. A top press aide to Ahmadinejad, Ali Akbar Javanfekr, also received a sentence of four years for threatening national security as part of the same case, Tasnim reported. Tasnim did not provide any further details on the cases involving the aides to Ahmadinejad, who was president from 2005 until 2013, or when the offences they were convicted of occurred. Rahim Mashaie was arrested in March and Javanfekr in August, the Iranian Students' News Agency reported Rahim Mashaei faces further charges, Gholamhossein Esmaili, the head of the justice department in Tehran province said Wednesday, according to Tasnim, without giving further details.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Iran posed a "formidable" threat to Europe, accusing its proxy Hizbullah of operating cells across the continent. Just last month, a member of the Lebanese group was jailed in Cyprus for plotting attacks on Israeli targets on the Mediterranean island. Netanyahu, on an official visit to Nicosia, said "Iran and Hizbullah organize a terrorist network that covers over 30 countries on five continents, including just about every country in Europe." Iran and leading world powers signed a deal this month on Tehran's controversial nuclear program, an accord the Israeli leader criticized as a "stunning, historic mistake". Netanyahu said Israel and Cyprus were faced with the dual dangers of Iran and the extremist attacks perpetrated by the Islamic State group, which controls large parts of Iraq and Syria. "ISIS obviously endangers European societies, Western societies, African societies, the whole world," the premier said, using an alternative acronym for IS. "These are two formidable dangers. They are expressed in many weapons, in many attacks, but the most prevalent one that concerns Cyprus and Europe is of course the terrorism that emanates from these areas," he added. Last month, a Cypriot court jailed a Lebanese-Canadian man for six years after he pleaded guilty to terror charges linked to 8.2 tonnes of potential bomb-making material found in his home. Authorities said the man was a member of the military wing of Hizbullah and had helped the group plan "terrorist attacks" on "Israeli interests in Cyprus". Cyprus is not known for its militant activity despite its proximity to the Middle East. But in 2013, a Cypriot court sentenced a Lebanon-born Swedish man who admitted he was a Hizbullah member, to four years in jail after he was found guilty of targeting Israelis on the island. A botched bomb attack on the Israeli embassy in 1988 claimed the lives of three people. Israel has repeatedly criticized the Iran nuclear deal and insists it is not bound to respect Tehran's accord with the West. Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades said he and Netanyahu had discussed the accord, adding that Cyprus expressed "hope that this deal will help generate stability... and assist in addressing the security concerns of the State of Israel". Tuesday's talks also focused on security, defense and the exploration of oil and gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean, according to Anastasiades. The Aphrodite field, discovered off Cyprus' southeast coast in 2011, is estimated to contain between 3.6 trillion and 6 trillion cubic feet (102 billion-170 billion cubic meters) of gas. Israel has found large reserves off its own shoreline and the two countries are looking to cooperate on energy issues such as exporting Israeli nature gas. "We think that by cooperating with each other we think that we can take it (natural gas) out more easily and market it better to the betterment of both our societies," Netanyahu said.

News article:
The nuclear deal between the West and Iran gives Tehran up to three months to hide illicit nuclear activity in hitherto undeclared locations, and not 24 days as claimed by the accord’s backers, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday. If Iran honors the agreement, it will be able to build numerous nuclear weapons with the blessing of the international community, he lamented during a briefing for Israeli diplomatic correspondents in his Jerusalem office. “The inspections regime is full of holes,” Netanyahu said. “This deal is terrible. It’s preferable to have no deal than this deal.” Under the Comprehensive Joint Plan of Action that the world powers signed with Iran earlier this month, Iran has 24 days before it needs to grant international inspectors access to hitherto undeclared sites they suspect host nuclear activity. But, Netanyahu said, if no agreement has been reached after that time elapses, the deal says that the complaint is to go to another committee trying to bridge the dispute, which will deal with the issue for another 30 days. If Iran still refuses to let inspectors into the site and the United Nations Security Council is involved, it will take another 30 days before any action is taken, the prime minister said.

During an in-depth briefing, interrupted by a phone call during which Netanyahu discussed the Iran deal and other regional issues with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the prime minister vociferously attacked the deal, saying it endangers Israel’s existence. “In another 10 to 15 years, Iran will become a nuclear threshold country with the potential to build nuclear weapons — with permission and authorization,” he said. Advertisement If US Congress rejects the deal, “it will avert the greatest danger of Iran becoming a legitimate nuclear threshold power in 10 years,” Netanyahu added. The opposition to the deal is growing steadily, he said, especially among Americans. “With every passing day there are more and more opponents to this deal. The more a person learns about the agreement, the more he opposes it,” Netanyahu said. This is true among the American public as well. The American conversation is important and you see it moving.” The prime minister pointed to a critical article by Leon Wieseltier, a frequent critic of Netanyahu’s policies, as proof that Jews and Americans were united in opposition to the deal. “It shows that you don’t have to be right wing Jew to criticize this agreement. You also don’t have to be a Jew at all to reject this agreement.” Recent polling has shown Americans, as well as American Jews, split on whether to support the deal. Religious Jews are most likely to oppose the agreement, according to most surveys. Advertisement He said that Sunni Arab states in the region shared his concerns about the pact. “Most Sunni Arab states don’t just criticize the deal, they fully reject it. They are outraged by the agreement,” he said. “There are very concrete threats on our existence. We’re not the only ones who understand that. Others understand it too.” The comments seemed to contradict US Defense Secretary Ash Carter, who earlier this month said Saudi Arabia had offered some support for the accord. In the UN Security Council, Jordan, another Sunni Arab state, voted for the deal. Netanyahu also said that Israel is not privy to all the content of the secret supplements of the agreement signed by Iran and the world powers. “We didn’t receive all the parts of the deal,” he said, refusing to elaborate. On Wednesday, national security adviser Yossi Cohen told Knesset lawmakers that Israel was being kept in the dark on the annexes. “Contrary to promises, Israel has not yet received all the written supplements to the agreement signed between Iran and the world powers,” Cohen, a former deputy head of the Mossad, told members of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. The nuclear deal is currently being weighed by Congress, which will likely vote on whether to support it in September. Netanyahu has indicated he will lobby against the deal in the US, even at the cost of ruffling feathers with the White House. Advertisement During the talk with Putin, the Russian president said the agreement “provided reliable guarantees” that Iran’s nuclear program is exclusively peaceful, according to the Kremlin. Putin said that the agreement would help secure nuclear non-proliferation and “have a positive impact on security and stability in the Middle East.”

News article:
By JTA July 30, 2015 The Orthodox Union is asking hundreds of rabbis to fly to Washington in September to lobby against the Iran nuclear deal. “We are confident that hundreds of rabbis traveling to Washington on the eve of this vote and just days before Rosh Hashanah will have a highly visible and real impact upon this fateful vote in Congress,” said a save-the-date notice sent this week by the Orthodox Union’s Washington office to rabbis affiliated with the umbrella group and with the Rabbinical Council of America. “We will only have this impact with your participation. The scheduled date for the fly-in is Sept. 9. Rosh Hashanah starts the evening of Sept. 13. Congress has until mid-to-late September to consider whether to kill the deal. President Barack Obama meanwhile is speaking on a phone call about the deal on Thursday evening. Invitations to call in went out through liberal groups backing the deal, including J Street, a Jewish Middle East policy group. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes the deal, will be addressing Americans through a live webcast next Monday organized by the Jewish Federations of North America and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Much of the jockeying is aimed at Congress, where opponents must muster two-thirds majorities in both chambers to kill the deal. A key target is congressional Democrats; most Republicans are already declared against the deal. Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., whose Queens-area district has a heavy Jewish presence, on Wednesday said she would oppose the deal. “I am deeply concerned that almost all of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure would remain intact,” Meng said in her statement. “This leads me to believe Iran would simply resume its pursuit of a nuclear weapon at the conclusion of the deal in a decade’s time.” Earlier this week, Rep. Sandy Levin (D-Mich.), the longest serving Jew in Congress, said he backed the deal. Also backing the deal is Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., who represents a heavily Jewish Chicago-area district and who is chief deputy whip for the minority Democratic caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Kerry Skips Israel on his Mideast Trip, but is Grilled for Keeping Secret Side Agreements Between Iran and the IAEA from Americans By: Lori Lowenthal Marcus http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/bibi-on-iran-deal-we-arent-partners-at-the-table-we-are-a-meal-on-the-menu-video/2015/07/30/ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu learned that U.S. Secretary of State will be making a trip to the Middle East to sell the Iran deal, but is skipping Israel. Kerry will be visiting Egypt and Qatar and other Gulf State representatives, but won’t stop in the Jewish State, which until recently was considered America’s closest ally in the Middle East. The Prime Minister’s response to the snub was, “Really, Kerry has no reason to come here.” Expanding upon that response, Netanyahu said of the Iran deal, “This deal has nothing to do with us. We are not influenced by this deal at all. We aren’t partners at the table, we are a meal on the menu.” These comments were made to reporters on Tuesday, July 28, during a return flight to Israel from Cyprus, as reported by Israel Hayom. It isn’t only America’s erstwhile BFF Israel that is expressing dismay at the nuclear deal concluded by the U.S., along with its other P5+1 partners, and Iran. Appearing before the House Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, Kerry and other deal cheerleaders were grilled on the likelihood of Iran honoring the commitments under the deal. “Iran has cheated on every agreement they’ve signed,” Rep. Ed Royce (R), chairman of the committee said. Royc continued, asking whether Iran “has earned the right to be trusted.” Kerry responded that “nothing in this deal is built on trust. Nothing.” SIDE DEAL DETAILS KEPT SECRET FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC On Wednesday, during the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the Iran deal, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK) queried Kerry and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz about the so-called “side agreements” between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Commission, responsible for inspecting Iranian nuclear sites. Cotton badgered Kerry as to why the contents of the side agreements cannot be made known to the American people, despite the Iranians knowing the content of the agreements. Cotton wanted Kerry to answer why this agreement was classified and kept from the American public. Kerry’s response was, “because we respect the process of the IAEA and we don’t have their authorization to reveal what is a confidential agreement.” Respect for another party can be admirable. However, according to Cotton: “But U.S. law requires any deal, between any party, not just the United States, be submitted to Congress before the 60 day clock begins to tick.” Watch the video of Sen. Cotton questioning Secretary of State Kerry who admits he has not read the text of the side agreements. About the Author: Lori Lowenthal Marcus is the US correspondent for The Jewish Press.

US official says deal never aimed to address Iran terror support WASHINGTON — The United States never considered addressing in the nuclear agreement with Iran the issue of Tehran’s sponsorship of terrorism and its calls for Israel’s annihilation, a senior US administration says. Israel knew this all along but then decided to turn these issues into make-or-break conditions for support of the deal, the official tells Israeli reporters. Jerusalem’s insistence that any deal address these issues would have killed any prospect of reaching an agreement, the senior official continues, adding that the conditions that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outlined in his contentious Congress speech in March made plain that Israel would object to any nuclear deal with Iran. “This has been a nuclear negotiation for over two years with the P5+1 and Iran, with very vigorous consultations with successive Israeli governments about the details of that negotiation,” the senior official says, referring to the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany. “Frankly, in none of our conversations with Israel over the years about the Iran nuclear negotiations were we contemplating bringing in those other elements of Iranian behavior.” Iranian nuclear negotiator Abbas Araqchi had a different take on the matter, telling Iranian journalists on Saturday: “We said during the talks that we cannot not provide weapons to Hezbollah, and we are not willing to sacrifice them for our nuclear program. Therefore, if you want to keep the weapon sanctions as part of the agreement, we will continue with our efforts. We discussed this matter for a while.” — Raphael Ahren with Times of Israel staff

News article:
Washington – President Barack Obama launched a blistering denunciation of opposition to his Iran deal Wednesday, arguing that none of the criticism stands up to scrutiny and warning that if Congress blocks the accord it will put the U.S. on the path to another Middle East war. “The choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy and some form of war,” Obama said in an address at American University. “Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not three months from now, but soon.” Seeking to isolate his critics, Obama said the rest of the world supports the Iran accord, with the notable exception of Israel. He reaffirmed his support for Israel’s security and said he doesn’t doubt the sincerity of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, one of the fiercest opponents of the agreement. But in a blunt assessment of Netanyahu’s views, Obama said “I believe he is wrong.” The president’s address, which lasted nearly an hour, was part of an intense summer lobbying campaign by both supporters and opponents of the nuclear deal. Members of Congress will vote next month on a resolution either approving or disapproving the pact. Opponents of the deal say it would leave too much of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure in place and allow Tehran to start rebuilding its program after a decade. Critics also contend Iran will use an influx of funds now frozen under international sanctions to boost terrorist activity around the Middle East. The White House has urged lawmakers to vote solely on the deal’s ability to prevent Iran from building a bomb, not on its other destabilizing activities or anti-American sentiments. Obama said that while Iranian hardliners may chant “Death to America” in the streets of Tehran, that’s not the belief of all Iranians. “In fact, it’s those hardliners who are most comfortable with the status quo,” he said. “It’s those hardliners chanting “Death to America” who have been most opposed to the deal. They’re making common cause with the Republican caucus.” Republicans, who are largely united in their opposition to the diplomatic deal, appeared unmoved by the president’s lengthy address. Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina accused him of relying on “endless strawmen to divert attention from his failed policies.” Obama drew on history to bolster support, saying the accord builds on an American tradition of “strong, principled diplomacy” with adversaries, including the former Soviet Union. He spoke at the same university where John F. Kennedy called for Cold War diplomacy and nuclear disarmament. Recalling more recent American history, Obama cast the upcoming vote in Congress as the nation’s most consequential foreign policy debate since the 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war. He said many of those who oppose the Iran pact are the same as those who pushed for the war, which is now known to have been based on flawed intelligence. While Obama was an early opponent of the Iraq war, several of his top foreign policy advisers voted for the 2002 authorization, including Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. They now say the war was a mistake. The agreement between the U.S., Iran and international powers aims to dismantle much of Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in relief from economic sanctions. The White House says the deal would cut off all of Iran’s pathways to a bomb and mandate robust inspections that would catch Tehran if it cheats. Challenging those who say the U.S. should have layered tougher sanctions on Tehran and held out for a better deal, Obama said they “are either ignorant of Iranian society or they’re just not being straight with the American people.” “If Congress were to kill this deal, they would not only pave Iran’s pathway to a bomb, they would accelerate it,” Obama said. The White House is preparing for the likelihood that lawmakers will vote against the deal next month and is focusing its lobbying efforts on getting enough Democrats to sustain a veto. Only one chamber of Congress is needed to sustain a veto and keep the deal in place. Obama spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday that the White House is confident it can sustain a veto “at least in the House.” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, announced his support on Wednesday, saying there is “no credible path to a better deal if the sanctions get weaker and Iran’s nuclear program gets stronger. The agreement has flaws, but the prospect that a better deal would result from congressional rejection seems like pure fantasy to me.” Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson of California, a former member of the House Intelligence Committee and a Vietnam War veteran, also announced his support.

President Reuven Rivlin warned of the dire consequences of the Iran nuclear agreement in a meeting with US Democrats on Wednesday. “We fear that this agreement is a first step in the legitimization of Iran’s policies and strategies, and only acts to further destabilize a chaotic region,” Rivlin told the delegation. After emphasizing the two countries’ shared commitment to democracy and human rights, Rivlin cautioned that the Iran deal threatens these values. “The current Iranian regime, act with a dangerous combination of aggressiveness, fundamentalism, and state sponsored terrorism – threatening even without nuclear weapons, freedom and democracy in this region and around the world,” Rivlin said.

Advertisement Israeli lawmakers had voiced strong opposition to the landmark nuclear deal reached between Iran and world powers last month, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning that the agreement was “a historic mistake.” Congressional Democrats were increasingly confident Monday that they will have the one-third votes in either chamber to defend a presidential veto against any legislative bid to overturn the Iran nuclear deal. Republicans in the House and Senate are expected to push through a “resolution disapproval,” effectively keeping the US out of the nuclear deal negotiated with Iran by a US-led group of six world powers. But US President Barack Obama has promised to veto such a bill, forcing Congress to produce a two-thirds majority in both houses to override the veto. While Republicans control a majority in both chambers, they cannot muster a two-thirds veto-proof majority without at least 44 Democratic House representatives and 13 Democratic senators.

News article:
Tehran – Speaking to an audience west of the capital, Tehran, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani predictably singled out Israel as the only country disappointed with its recent nuclear agreement with the international community, according to FARS news. “Today you observe that the only regime which is crying out from morning to night is the usurper Zionist regime,” he said, referring to the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who has repeatedly appealed to world leaders, as well as American politicians and most recently American Jewry, to oppose the deal. Netanyahu has argued that the deal officially, brokered between US Secretary of State John Kerry on behalf of the P5 +1 nations and Iran’s chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, provides Iran with multiple means of becoming a nuclear threshold state and infuses it with billions of dollars with which to finance its proxies throughout the Middle East. Dubbed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, both sides agreed on the plan reached on July 14. A week later, it was endorsed by the United State Security Council and became international legislation. However, in the American political arena, the deal still faces an obstacle in the form of a Congressional vote and politicians hostile to the deal, who Rouhani referred to as “American warmongers,” hail from either side of the Republican- Democrat divide. “Today all the regional nations and the great Iranian nation, except the usurper Zionist regime and the American warmongers, are happy with this big agreement.” On Thursday, opponents of the deal, who need the support of 44 House Democrats and 13 Senate Democrats to strike down the JCPA, won a significant victory whenSenator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, expressed his intention to vote against the President Barack Obama’s landmark diplomatic achievement. The Senior Jewish Senator was also joined by another ranking Jewish figure, Congressman Eliot Engel, from New York, in his opposition to the agreement, which Schumer said “would allow Iran, after ten to fifteen years, to be a nuclear threshold state with the blessing of the world community.”‎

News article:
Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon implied that Israel may seek to assassinate Iranian nuclear scientists in order stop Iran's nuclear program in an interview with the German newspaper Der Spiegel, released on Friday. In response to the question "So will we see further deaths of Iranian nuclear scientists through attacks or malware compromising Iranian computer networks?", Ya'alon said: "We should be ready to defend ourselves. I'm not responsible for the lives of Iranian scientists." Ya'alon also didn't rule out the possibility that Israel would bomb Iranian nuclear facilities should Iran violate the deal and resume its military nuclear program. "In such a case, we will have to discuss it," Ya'alon told Der Spiegel. "At the end, it is very clear. One way or another, the Iranian military nuclear ambitions should be stopped. "We can in no way tolerate an Iran with nuclear weapons. We prefer for this to be done through a deal or sanctions, but in the end, Israel should be able to defend itself." In the Der Spiegel interview, Ya'alon reiterated Israeli objections to the deal, reached between Iran and world powers in July. Ya'alon warned that the deal would make Iran into a nuclear threshold state, and that lifting the sanctions would lead to an increase in the funds Iran transfers to terrorist groups around the Middle East. Five Iranian scientists were reportedly assassinated between 2012 and 2014, and though Israel has never commented officially on these killings, major Western media, quoting off-the-record Israeli intelligence sources, have attributed them to the Mossad. In March 2014, CBS News reported that following pressure from the Obama administration, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had ordered the Mossad to stop the assassinations. CBS national correspondent Dan Raviv, an expert on Israeli intelligence, reported that the Mossad "ran an assassination campaign for several years aimed at Iran's top nuclear scientists. The purpose was to slow the progress made by Iran, which Israel feels certain is aimed at developing nuclear weapons; and to deter trained and educated Iranians from joining their country's nuclear program." "Remarkably, the Israeli assassins were never caught, obviously having long-established safe houses inside Iran – although several Iranians who may have helped the Mossad were arrested and executed," the CBS report stated.

News article:
Israel's defense minister hinted on Friday that the Jewish state's intelligence services were behind the rash of killings of Iranian nuclear scientists. In an interview with the German-language Der Spiegel, Moshe Ya'alon said that he bore no responsibility "for the life expectancy of Iranian scientists." "Ultimately it is very clear, one way or another, Iran’s military nuclear program must be stopped,” Ya’alon said. “We will act in any way and are not willing to tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran. We prefer that this be done by means of sanctions, but in the end, Israel should be able to defend itself." Ya'alon told Der Spiegel that he believed historians would one day look back on the Iran nuclear agreement as an instance in which Western politicians sought to "kick the can down the road" by preferring to avoid dealing with the issue. The defense minister compared the nuclear deal to other examples in which Western leaders sought the path of reconciliation in an attempt to find a solution, only to discover that they paid a hefty price afterward - a reference to the Munich agreement between Britain and Germany just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War. In the interview with Der Spiegel, Ya'alon repeated his stance that the nuclear negotiations between the world powers and Iran were "a historic mistake." The defense minister maintained that the agreement with Iran would enable it to remain a "nuclear threshold state" that would be permitted to enrich uranium within a decade. Ya'alon said that the lifting of economic sanctions against Iran would provide the Islamic Republic with a windfall of hundreds of billions of dollars with which it can more easily "export the revolution." That means more money to Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Houthis in Yemen, and Shi'ites in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, Ya'alon said. The defense minister lamented the fact that the agreement did not address "missiles that endanger Israel and parts of Europe." He told Der Spiegel that the only effective strategy against Iran would be to leave the regime with a choice - either it acquires nuclear weapons or it is permitted to survive. Earlier this year, a senior Iranian security official said that the elite Revolutionary Guards Corps thwarted a Mossad assassination attempt against one of its nuclear scientists. “In the last two years, the Zionist enemy was trying hard to assassinate an Iranian nuclear scientist, but the timely presence of the IRGC security forces thwarted the terrorist operation,” Col. Ya’qoub Baqeri, the deputy chief liaison officer of the Flight Guards Corps, told the country’s Fars News Agency. The Revolutionary Guards is “duty-bound to protect the lives of the country’s nuclear scientists,” said Baqeri. According to a report by CBS News last year, the Obama administration pressured Israel to stop carrying out assassinations inside Iran against the country’s nuclear scientists. Israel has never admitted to carrying out such killings. At least five scientists have been killed, mostly by car bombs. Mossad officials concluded that the assassination campaign became too dangerous for its spies, said the report. This came amidst Washington’s attempt to reach a nuclear deal with Iran. Meanwhile, Baqeri also told Fars that Iranian air marshals from the IRGC have foiled Islamic State plots to hijack Iranian passenger planes in recent years. “The ISIL [Daesh] and other Salafi groups sought to hit a blow to our country this way, but fortunately, they couldn’t put their plots into practice,” Baqeri said.

News article:
Jerusalem – Israel anticipates that the US Congress will heed its call and vote down the Iran nuclear deal against the wishes of the Obama administration, the head of the powerful Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee told Israel Radio on Tuesday. “I’m convinced that the American Congress will reject by a large majority the nuclear agreement with Iran,” MK Tzachi Hanegbi (Likud) said. “There is a plethora of explanations and reasons as to why the agreement weakens the United States.” Hanegbi told Israel Radio that the government in Jerusalem was urging members of Congress to view the agreement through the prism of “what was good for their country, not Israel.” The Israeli government certainly has its work cut out for it, especially after Senator Brian Schatz said on Monday he backs the US-led international nuclear deal with Iran, becoming the 16th senator to do so and moving President Barack Obama one vote closer to locking in enough Senate votes to make the deal fly. A liberal, Jewish-born lawmaker from Hawaii, Schatz had been expected to come down in favor of the deal. But his decision was noteworthy because it came just a few days after another Jewish senator, Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York, announced his opposition to the Iran agreement. Schumer’s decision last week caused an uproar as he usually lines up behind the president. He is the No. 3 senator and wants to become Senate Democratic leader after the 2016 election. In a statement, Schatz said he was backing the pact between six world powers and Iran because it is the best option for keeping nuclear bombs out of Tehran’s hands. “Iran must never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, and that is why I support this agreement,” Schatz said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes the agreement, as do some Jewish groups in the United States. Most Republicans have also said they oppose the deal, which was unveiled on July 14. It is designed to curb Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for lifting of economic sanctions. Republicans plan to push for a congressional “resolution of disapproval” that could cripple the deal. Obama is pinning his hopes on Democrats, in the minority in both houses of Congress. Several key votes on the deal are likely in weeks ahead after Congress returns from its August recess. Schatz said no military option could do what the agreement would do – deny Iran a bomb for at least 15 years. “This agreement should not be compared to an imaginary deal where Iran rolled over and eliminated all its centrifuges and all peaceful nuclear energy generation. That was never seriously on the table,” he said. Congress has until Sept. 17 to vote on any resolution of disapproval of the agreement. After Schumer’s announcement last week, Democrats said they were still confident they could rebuff Republican attempts to sink the agreement. Content is provided courtesy of the Jerusalem Post

As the battle over the Iran nuclear agreement continues to rattle the American political establishment, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week hosted two delegations of US congressmen from both sides of the aisle. During both meetings at his office in Jerusalem, Netanyahu argued strongly against the deal, but stopped short of explicitly calling on the legislators to vote against it in Congress next month. “He made his case very expansively without trying to pressure anyone how to vote,” a source with intimate knowledge of the meetings told The Times of Israel. Still, according to a second source, he did assert that it was a “moral duty” to thwart the agreement. On Sunday, Netanyahu hosted a group of 22 Democrats headed by House Whip Steny H. Hoyer (Maryland). On Wednesday, he met with 36 Republican lawmakers led by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (CA). “He did not tell us how to vote,” McCarthy, who is on the record opposing the deal, told Israeli reporters Thursday in Jerusalem. “He’s much like every leader of every other country, [who] convey what they see.” Earlier this week, Hoyer — who has not yet announced how he’s going to vote — said Netanyahu made his case in a “respectful” and “moderate” fashion. “He understands that the decision is up to the members of the House that owe their judgment to their constituents,” Hoyer told the Haaretz daily after the prime minister’s meeting with the Democratic legislators.

He understood that many if not all of them would vote for the deal, even if they had misgivings about it.” The prime minister met the groups for about an hour and a half each, and pointed out what he believes are the fatal weaknesses of the accord with the help of a marker and a white board. He jotted down some of his arguments and then took time to answer all the congressmen’s questions. “Had there been more questions, he would have been happy to answer them, although he had other meetings waiting for him,” the source said. On Wednesday, Hoyer and McCarthy issued a joint statement of support for Israel, which hails America’s funding of the Iron Dome missile defense system but doesn’t mention the Iran deal. “Congress stands united with Israel, not only in support of its Iron Dome defenses, but also in preserving Israel’s security and ensuring the safety of its people,” it stated. “In these dangerous times, Israel can always be certain that the American people are by their side.” JTA contributed to this report.

As the battle over the Iran nuclear agreement continues to rattle the American political establishment, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week hosted two delegations of US congressmen from both sides of the aisle. During both meetings at his office in Jerusalem, Netanyahu argued strongly against the deal, but stopped short of explicitly calling on the legislators to vote against it in Congress next month. “He made his case very expansively without trying to pressure anyone how to vote,” a source with intimate knowledge of the meetings told The Times of Israel. Still, according to a second source, he did assert that it was a “moral duty” to thwart the agreement. On Sunday, Netanyahu hosted a group of 22 Democrats headed by House Whip Steny H. Hoyer (Maryland). On Wednesday, he met with 36 Republican lawmakers led by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (CA). “He did not tell us how to vote,” McCarthy, who is on the record opposing the deal, told Israeli reporters Thursday in Jerusalem. “He’s much like every leader of every other country, [who] convey what they see.” Earlier this week, Hoyer — who has not yet announced how he’s going to vote — said Netanyahu made his case in a “respectful” and “moderate” fashion. “He understands that the decision is up to the members of the House that owe their judgment to their constituents,” Hoyer told the Haaretz daily after the prime minister’s meeting with the Democratic legislators.

He said, ‘It is not my place to tell you how to vote. It is up to you — but my opinion is…’” While it’s true that Netanyahu refrained from urging members to oppose the deal, he did speak of a “moral duty” to defeat the deal, leaving “little to the imagination,” one source critical of his comportment said. Most if not all Republican congressmen are likely vote against the agreement with Iran, while many Democrats are expected to back their president and the deal he has negotiated. US President Barack Obama has vowed to veto legislation trying to kill the deal. He needs the support of one-third of either the House or the Senate to block efforts to override his veto. Advertisement During Sunday’s meetings with the Democratic lawmakers, Netanyahu acknowledged that many if not all of them might find it hard to vote against Obama, the leader of their party and a strong advocate for the deal, a source said. “But he acted in a very similar fashion in his meeting with the Republicans, thoroughly explaining why he thinks the deal is terrible. He didn’t act like the Republicans will vote against it anyway, so why bother.” The atmosphere at both meetings was serious, with a focused Netanyahu making his case reservedly and patiently, several sources familiar with the meetings said. But it was unclear whether Netanyahu managed to change any Democrats’ minds about supporting the deal, one source said. “There were no surprises, no Aha! moments that somebody said, ‘Now I see the light.’” Netanyahu attaches great importance to his meetings with American congressmen, especially with the Democrats, and that was evident during this week’s meeting, the source told The Times of Israel, speaking on condition of anonymity. “He was respectful of the sensitivities involved, of the predicaments the Democrats have here. He understood that many if not all of them would vote for the deal, even if they had misgivings about it.” The prime minister met the groups for about an hour and a half each, and pointed out what he believes are the fatal weaknesses of the accord with the help of a marker and a white board.

News article:
Benjamin Netanyahu’s go-for-broke onslaught in Congress against the Iran nuclear deal has been described as a lose-lose situation that would leave Israel worse off, no matter what happens. One of the most oft-asked questions in recent weeks in Jerusalem and Washington, therefore, is this: “What is he thinking?” According to several sources who are privy to Netanyahu’s most recent discussions with American interlocutors, and based on what they have heard and how they interpret the prime minister’s words, the answer is this: Netanyahu is under no illusion about the ultimate outcome of the campaign. He accepts the prognosis that there won’t be enough Democratic votes in Congress to override a presidential veto. He is getting used to the idea that the Iran nuclear deal, which he has described as a “stunning mistake,” is already a fait accompli. Nonetheless, Netanyahu has refused to engage President Obama or the administration in talks about what the media describes as security “compensation” for the Iran deal. Obama has said that Netanyahu believes that this would signal acceptance of the Iran accord and would weaken the resolve of its potential opponents in Congress. Obama told Jewish leaders that Netanyahu is wasting precious time in which Israel’s defense capabilities against Iran and Hezbollah could have been upgraded. Analysts maintain that Netanyahu would be able to secure higher rewards for Israel now, when his implied acquiescence to a deal is valuable to the Obama administration, rather than later, when the deal is either done or undone and Netanyahu’s attitude is far less important. Netanyahu sees things differently. He believes that passage of the Iran accord by virtue of a Democratic bloc that supports the president will strengthen his hand, not weaken it. According to his view, after the dust settles in Congress, Democrats will be desperate to mend fences with Jewish voters and donors in advance of the 2016 elections and will be pressing the administration to mollify Netanyahu, who will continue to wax indignant for as long as possible. His leverage against an administration that has gotten its way will be far greater than it is against a president who is pulling out all stops to achieve victory, he believes. Netanyahu also sees fringe benefits in his strategy, according to people who have heard him. He believes that the fight over the Iran deal will weaken the Democrats not only with Jews but also with the American public overall. Win or lose in Congress, Americans view the agreement with Tehran’s ayatollahs as an accord with terrorists if not a deal with the devil. For those who aren’t convinced, Netanyahu will gladly provide both proof and argumentation. This could be Netanyahu’s contribution to a Republican victory in November 2016. He would then gain a grateful GOP President who may not scuttle the deal overnight, as he or she now promises, but would certainly adopt a tougher attitude on its implementation, Netanyahu believes. From Netanyahu’s point of view, this could be a win-win rather than a lose-lose situation: he would take credit for extracting the best possible security compensation for Israel’s defense. He would weaken Democrats and in effect punish them for supporting Obama and his terrible deal, and could see a pro-Israel Republican administration taking power to boot. In addition, he would confound all of his critics, detractors and naysayers in Israel and America who have accused him of making the wrong decisions at every turn. Of course, skeptics might think that Netanyahu is being too clever by half. That he is ignoring the effects of lingering resentments in the White House and pent up anger among Democrats, especially moderate ones, who have been caught between a rock and a hard place in recent weeks. Netanyahu is also overlooking the long lasting damage to the American Jewish community, which is now splitting between pro and anti-deal factions, between those who see anti-Semitic motives in the administration’s battle for its policy and others who are outraged by the accusations of Jew-hatred leveled against the U.S. President. And that it is reckless of Netanyahu to wreak all this havoc on Israel-US relations and on American Jews on a campaign that was doomed from the outset. And then there is the issue of Netanyahu banking on a Republican victory in 2016, a subject on which he’s already on record as erring badly, you will recall, the last time around. Netanyahu has surrounded himself with likeminded conservatives to the extent that he is blind to the rest of America, one source told me. He is increasingly out of touch with minorities, millennials and liberals, Jewish and otherwise, the source added, which is why it’s so easy for him to discount their influence and to write them off, with potentially disastrous results.

News article:
The nuclear deal with Iran will give the U.S., Israel and other countries the “freedom” to confront Tehran’s support for terrorism and violations of human rights, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz told Jewish groups Thursday. Speaking from Washington in remarks broadcast live online, Moniz said the agreement with Iran could allow the U.S. to increase its attention on “other aspects of Iranian behavior that give us serious problems.” {mosads}“We are trying to increase security cooperation” with Israel and Arab allies, Moniz said in a webcast session coordinated by Jewish Federations of North America. “Doing so with the comfort that Iran does not have and will not have a nuclear weapon — the existential threat of a nuclear weapon — will, if anything, give us more freedom of action, if you like, in addressing all these other problems.” Moniz’s statement about the ability to crack down on Iran’s support for Hezbollah and Houthi rebels in Yemen and its detainment of four American prisoners was coupled with a lengthy discussion about the scientific components of the deal, which limits Iran’s nuclear powers in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. “The bottom line is Iran today is what we call a threshold state — it may not have a weapon today, but it has the capabilities and is very close to getting there if they choose to do so,” he said. “This agreement pulls them way back from that threshold for a substantial period.” The direct lobbying pitch to Jewish groups is part of a weeks-long effort to convince both the American public and members of Congress to back the deal ahead of a congressional vote scheduled for mid-September. The Obama administration is facing stiff opposition to the agreement but is nonetheless notching victories among Democrats who could provide critical votes. Moniz has been a top salesman on the deal and has become a favorite even of members of Congress who are opposed to the accord. Jewish Americans are considered to be particularly skeptical of the deal, due to deep-seated fears about the threat posed by Iran and the vehement opposition from top leaders in the Israeli government. Moniz’s appearance on the Jewish organization’s website Thursday came just more than a week after a similar appearance by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin, who warned that the agreement “actually paves Iran’s path to the bomb.” Critics of the agreement allege its oversight mechanisms are weak, meaning Iran could easily cheat by evading inspectors’ prying eyes. Additionally, they warn that it sets the stage for Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon when many of the terms of the deal run out in 10 to 15 years, and that it stays silent on Iran’s other contested actions, such as the support for terror groups.

“Most especially, we are deeply concerned with the impression that the leadership of the American Jewish community is united in opposition to the agreement,” the letter states. “We, along with many other Jewish leaders, fully support this historic nuclear accord.” The Jewish community around the world, concentrated in the U.S. and Israel, has paid close attention to the nuclear deal, which was negotiated by the U.S., Iran, Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia China and the European Union. It aims to hamper Iran’s ability to produce a nuclear weapon and would lift sanctions on the theocratic regime. Many American Jews, citing Iran’s leaders’ repeated denunciations of the U.S. and threats to destroy Israel, have concluded that no deal with Iran is a good deal. Several national Jewish organizations, including the American Israel Public Affairs Committee — as well as many evangelical Christians — are lobbying Congress to vote it down. The rabbis who sent the letter Monday argue that, while they have reason to distrust Iran’s leaders, the deal is the best available strategy to confront the specter of a nuclear Iran. And they want to challenge assumptions that Jews who oppose the deal represent American Jews as a whole. “A wide array of views about the nuclear deal exist among American Jews,” said Rabbi Rachel Mikva of Chicago, who signed the letter. She and others point to a recent poll from the L.A. Jewish Journal, which showed that Jewish Americans support the Iran deal by a larger margin than Americans in general, with 49 percent of American Jews approving of it, and 31 percent disapproving. The poll, of 501 American Jews, had a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points. The signatories to the letter include many rabbis in the more liberal Reform movement — the largest stream of Judaism — but also at least 50 rabbis from the more traditional Conservative movement, and at least one Orthodox rabbi, according to organizers of the effort. “There is no denying that there are differences of opinion within the mainstream Jewish community,” said Nathan Diament, executive director for public policy of the Orthodox Union, which represents most of the 10 percent of American Jews who call themselves Orthodox. While the Orthodox Union does not claim to speak for all of American Jews, and while the deal should not be judged on a poll, there is no question that the Orthodox are overwhelmingly opposed to the agreement, he said. “We are planning to bring hundreds of rabbis to Washington in early September to lobby Congress and make this point.” The Reform Jewish movement plans to release a statement on the deal this week.

News article:
August 18, 2015 Despite the ferocious political attacks between the White House and the Israeli government, one hears from both sides positive ramblings about future relations between the two countries. Governmental spokespeople, mainly in Israel, describe the current rift over the Iranian nuclear deal as an unfortunate incident, or “accident,” in a family with genuinely good relations. This, however, is not the case, and there certainly might be long-term damage to the strategic alliance between the two countries. A senior State Department official involved in US Middle East policy told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity that while it is the Barack Obama administration’s intention to uphold good relations between the countries, including upgrading security assistance to Israel after congressional debate on the Iranian agreement, it might take a long time before the past level of trust between the two countries is restored. “The current mistrust toward the Israeli government is such that it may erode the very quality of coordination between the two governments,” he said. One comes away from talking to this State Department source with the impression that the schism is not only in regard to the policy approach on how to deal with Iranian nuclear ambitions, but even more so the result of the Israeli prime minister’s partisanship. Since the last US elections, Washington believes that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been siding with the Republicans. He made little secret of his preference for Mitt Romney, Obama's Republican opponent in the last presidential election, and most probably hopes for a Republican to replace Obama in the 2016 elections. One can conclude from the State Department source that in addition to possible long-term damage, short-term damage can already be seen in US-Israeli relations in several key areas. One involves the nuclear deal itself, as the lack of mutual trust could harm the pace and scope of information exchange in regard to the implementation of the Iran deal. Also, as Netanyahu’s overall Middle East policies are seen as a rejection of any diplomatic process in the region, the United States will be severely critical of any settlement expansion in the West Bank and will not, contrary to the past, block European punitive measures involving Israeli settlements. Although the United States will not initiate an active peace policy given the unwillingness of the parties to negotiate, Washington, said the State Department source, is considering not casting a veto against a French proposal on Palestinian statehood at the UN Security Council. Anti-terror policy coordination in relation to Hezbollah, the Islamic State and Hamas will continue among Israeli and US defense officials, but broader strategic policy coordination will be stalled, even in the likely event of a future Obama-Netanyahu meeting. Even more worrisome are the possible long-term repercussions of the current crisis in US-Israeli relations. The most dangerous among them is damage to the US perception of a values-based strategic partnership between two peace-seeking liberal democracies. Today’s Washington perceives serious erosion in Israel’s commitment to these values. This was once the most basic foundation of the strategic alliance. Another potential issue with longer-term repercussions is that Israel is now perceived as partisan, that is, pro-Republican Party. Israel is also on the wrong side of US demographics, in other words, the growing coalition of minorities that is more represented by the Democratic Party than by the Republicans. Furthermore, Israel will emerge from this crisis with the image of its relationship with the United States as tarnished in the eyes of the Arab world. The image of a strong alliance was always an important part of Israel’s deterrence vis-a-vis its neighbors. So while one might hear positive rhetoric about the re-establishment of a good relationship after the congressional debate, there is much room for concern and soul-searching about the future of Israeli-US relations. This crisis demands a fundamental change in Israeli policy vis-a-vis the United States. An immediate change is called for in the prime minister’s relationship with the White House. Israel must recognize the reality of the Iran deal and work with President Obama and his national security team on its ramifications. Close cooperation is necessary for monitoring Iranian compliance with the agreement. In the immediate future, a security assistance package should be agreed upon for the supply of sophisticated defensive arms and systems. In parallel, the two governments need to coordinate peace policies in the region based on the two-state solution and cooperation with the pragmatic Sunni axis against the fundamentalist terror groups. These elements should lead the United States and Israel to conclude a political-security partnership agreement parallel to the Iranian agreement. The first step in this direction is for the Israeli prime minister to announce that bipartisanship will be the basis for future relations with the United States and release the Jewish lobby from the plague of dual loyalty tests.

Below is the content of the letter: We, the undersigned rabbis, write as a unified voice across religious denominations to express our concerns with the proposed nuclear agreement with Iran. For more than 20 months, our communities have kept keen eyes on the nuclear negotiations overseas. As our diplomats from Washington worked tirelessly to reach a peaceful resolution to the Iranian nuclear challenge--we have hoped, and believed, that a good deal was possible. Unfortunately, that hope is not yet realized. We have weighed the various implications of supporting--or opposing--this agreement. Together, we are deeply troubled by the proposed deal, and believe this agreement will harm the short-term and long-term interests of both the United States and our allies, particularly Israel. Collectively, we feel we must do better. If this agreement is implemented, Iran will receive as much as 150 billion dollars, without any commitment to changing its nefarious behavior. The Iranian regime denies basic human rights to its citizens, publicly calls for America's downfall and Israel's annihilation, and openly denies the Holocaust. This dangerous regime--the leading state sponsor of terrorism--could now be given the financial freedom to sow even more violence throughout the world. But what do we get in return? Even after flooding Iran with an influx of funds, this deal will not subject Iran to an airtight, comprehensive inspections structure--granting the regime the means to violate the agreement and develop a covert nuclear program. The deal would also lift key arms embargos, so that in eight years Iran will be given international legitimacy to arm terror groups with conventional weapons and ballistic missiles. The agreement also entitles Iran to develop advanced centrifuges after 10 years--all-but paving Iran's path to a nuclear weapons capability with virtually zero "breakout time." We fear the world we will leave our children if this deal is approved. And we fear having to someday bear the responsibility for Iran becoming wealthier, further empowered and better equipped to produce nuclear bombs when we had the chance to stop it. For these reasons, we agree with the assessments of leaders and experts in the United States, along with virtually all Israeli voices across the political spectrum, that we can, and must, do better. We call upon our Senators and Representatives to consider the dangers that this agreement poses to the United States and our allies, and to vote in opposition to this deal. Furthermore, we strongly support and heed the call to action of many Jewish organizations to express our collective opposition to this dangerous agreement. At this historic moment, with so much at stake, we have a critical responsibility to shape the world we pass on to our children. With no less than the safety of future generations hanging in the balance, we must insist on a better deal. We hope and pray that God will assist us in ushering in for the entire world a time promised by Isaiah (2:4) when "nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they engage in war anymore," when peace will prevail. Until then, we simply cannot afford to empower and enrich a regime that continues to lift its sword without mercy towards so many who stand for good, freedom and peace.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday said Israel does not object to allowing Iran to have a civilian nuclear program, only a military one. In a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, Netanyahu said last month’s nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers allows the Islamic Republic to retain infrastructure that would be unnecessary for a peaceful nuclear program. The prime minister was apparently responding to comments Friday by US President Barack Obama, who suggested critics of the Iran deal were against the Islamic Republic having any sort of nuclear program, “even a peaceful one.” “Let me make clear, Matteo, that Israel doesn’t oppose a civilian nuclear program in Iran. We oppose a military nuclear program in Iran,” Netanyahu said during an official visit to Italy. “And regrettably, the deal with Iran allows it to keep and expand a formidable nuclear infrastructure that is completely unnecessary for civilian nuclear purposes, but is entirely necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.” Under the deal, as various sunset clauses take effect, “Iran within 13 years (will have) the ability to make as many centrifuges as they want, enrich as much uranium as they want to whatever level that they want,” Netanyahu charged. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “And this will put the Iranian Islamic state that practices terrorism worldwide, it will put it on the threshold of an entire nuclear arsenal,” he added. In a Friday address to American Jews, Obama had said: “In the best of all worlds, Iran would have no nuclear infrastructure whatsoever… unfortunately, that’s not a reality that’s attainable.” “Those who say they want a better deal, that this isn’t a good deal, and they want a better deal, typically mean that not only do they want Iran not to have nuclear weapons, but they don’t want it to have any nuclear program at all, even a peaceful one,” the US president said. Advertisement Obama on Friday compared tensions between the US and Israel over the nuclear deal to a family feud and said he expected quick improvements in ties between the longtime allies once the accord was implemented. “Like all families, sometimes there are going to be disagreements,” Obama said in a webcast with Jewish Americans. “And sometimes people get angrier about disagreements in families than with folks that aren’t family.” The president’s comments came as momentum for the nuclear accord grew on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers will vote next month on a resolution to disapprove of the deal. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., became the 30th senator to publicly back the agreement, saying Friday that it was a good deal for America and for allies like Israel. If Senate Democrats can amass 41 votes in favor of the deal, they could block passage of the disapproval resolution. Obama has vowed to veto the resolution if it passes, and Democrats could hold off Republican efforts to override his veto if they get 34 votes — just four more than they have now. The looming congressional confrontation has sparked a summer of intense debate between supporters and opponents of the nuclear accord. The deliberations have also divided Jewish Americans, with leaders of many organizations expressing concern about long-term damage to the community. The president encouraged skeptics of the agreement to “overcome the emotions” that have infused the debate and evaluate the accord based on facts. Advertisement “I would suggest that in terms of the tone of this debate everybody keep in mind that we’re all pro-Israel,” he said. “We have to make sure that we don’t impugn people’s motives.” The US negotiated alongside Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China for nearly two years before finalizing a landmark accord to curb Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief. As he has in previous speeches and interviews, Obama sought to refute criticism of the accord point by point. He disputed the notion that Iran would funnel the bulk of the money it receives from the sanctions relief into terrorism, saying Iranian leaders are more likely to try to bolster their weak economy. He also said the agreement wasn’t built on trusting Iran’s government, which frequently spouts anti-American and anti-Israeli rhetoric. “It’s precisely because we’re not counting on the nature of the regime to change that it’s so important for us to make sure they don’t have a nuclear weapon,” he said.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday said Israel does not object to allowing Iran to have a civilian nuclear program, only a military one. In a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, Netanyahu said last month’s nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers allows the Islamic Republic to retain infrastructure that would be unnecessary for a peaceful nuclear program. The prime minister was apparently responding to comments Friday by US President Barack Obama, who suggested critics of the Iran deal were against the Islamic Republic having any sort of nuclear program, “even a peaceful one.” “Let me make clear, Matteo, that Israel doesn’t oppose a civilian nuclear program in Iran. We oppose a military nuclear program in Iran,” Netanyahu said during an official visit to Italy. “And regrettably, the deal with Iran allows it to keep and expand a formidable nuclear infrastructure that is completely unnecessary for civilian nuclear purposes, but is entirely necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.” Under the deal, as various sunset clauses take effect, “Iran within 13 years (will have) the ability to make as many centrifuges as they want, enrich as much uranium as they want to whatever level that they want,” Netanyahu charged.

In a Friday address to American Jews, Obama had said: “In the best of all worlds, Iran would have no nuclear infrastructure whatsoever… unfortunately, that’s not a reality that’s attainable.” “Those who say they want a better deal, that this isn’t a good deal, and they want a better deal, typically mean that not only do they want Iran not to have nuclear weapons, but they don’t want it to have any nuclear program at all, even a peaceful one,” the US president said. Advertisement Obama on Friday compared tensions between the US and Israel over the nuclear deal to a family feud and said he expected quick improvements in ties between the longtime allies once the accord was implemented. “Like all families, sometimes there are going to be disagreements,” Obama said in a webcast with Jewish Americans. “And sometimes people get angrier about disagreements in families than with folks that aren’t family.” The president’s comments came as momentum for the nuclear accord grew on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers will vote next month on a resolution to disapprove of the deal. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., became the 30th senator to publicly back the agreement, saying Friday that it was a good deal for America and for allies like Israel. If Senate Democrats can amass 41 votes in favor of the deal, they could block passage of the disapproval resolution. Obama has vowed to veto the resolution if it passes, and Democrats could hold off Republican efforts to override his veto if they get 34 votes — just four more than they have now. The looming congressional confrontation has sparked a summer of intense debate between supporters and opponents of the nuclear accord. The deliberations have also divided Jewish Americans, with leaders of many organizations expressing concern about long-term damage to the community. The president encouraged skeptics of the agreement to “overcome the emotions” that have infused the debate and evaluate the accord based on facts. Advertisement “I would suggest that in terms of the tone of this debate everybody keep in mind that we’re all pro-Israel,” he said. “We have to make sure that we don’t impugn people’s motives.” The US negotiated alongside Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China for nearly two years before finalizing a landmark accord to curb Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief. As he has in previous speeches and interviews, Obama sought to refute criticism of the accord point by point. He disputed the notion that Iran would funnel the bulk of the money it receives from the sanctions relief into terrorism, saying Iranian leaders are more likely to try to bolster their weak economy. He also said the agreement wasn’t built on trusting Iran’s government, which frequently spouts anti-American and anti-Israeli rhetoric. “It’s precisely because we’re not counting on the nature of the regime to change that it’s so important for us to make sure they don’t have a nuclear weapon,” he said. Friday’s webcast was hosted by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and The Jewish Federations of North America. Organizers said thousands of people participated and questions submitted online were selected by the moderators.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday held a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in Florence, whre he said that Israel was only opposed to an Iranian military nuclear program, not one meant for peaceful purposes. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter "Let me make clear, Matteo, that Israel doesn’t oppose a civilian nuclear program in Iran," said Netanyahu. "We oppose a military nuclear program in Iran." The prime minister also told Renzi: "All the people of Israel were moved by your historic speech in the Knesset. I've heard many speeches in the Knesset. Yours was one of the exceptional ones that touched on basic truths that bind our two countries and our common civilization... I look forward to discussing with you this evening how we can further expand the cooperation between Israel and Italy in technology, in agriculture, in culture and science, in fighting terrorism, in security and stability for our world. Netanyahu and Renzi at the City Hall of Florence (Photo: GPO/Getty Images) Netanyahu discussed the threat posed by Iran with Renzi, saying: "The savagery of the Islamic State of ISIS captures the world’s attention, and justifiably so. But I believe that a far more serious threat is posed by another Islamic state, the Islamic State of Iran, and specifically its pursuit of nuclear weapons... And regrettably, the deal with Iran allows it to keep and expand a formidable nuclear infrastructure that is completely unnecessary for civilian nuclear purposes, but is entirely necessary for the production of nuclear weapons. "The deal will give Iran within 13 years the ability to make as many centrifuges as they want, enrich as much uranium as they want to whatever level that they want," continued Netanyahu. "And this will put the Iranian Islamic state that practices terrorism worldwide, it will put it on the threshold of an entire nuclear arsenal. Netanyahu and Renzi shake hands at Palazzo Vecchio in Florence (Photo: AP) Netanyahu further warned that "Iran will get hundreds of billions of dollars of sanctions relief and investments to fuel its aggression and terrorism in the Middle East, in North Africa and beyond that. I think that this will make Iran far richer and far stronger militarily, and it will make it far more difficult to confront its nuclear ambitions in the future." Netanyahu and his wife Sara landed in Milan on Thursday and attended Expo 2015, dedicated to developments in agriculture and food. They continued on to Florence, where Netanyahu also met leaders in the Jewish community.

News article:
By JTA September 2, 2015 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to continue his campaign against the Iran nuclear deal, even as President Barack Obama has secured enough congressional support to sustain a veto of any effort to block it. Hours after Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., announced that she was supporting the agreement, effectively ensuring that the deal will survive attempts in Congress to overturn it, an unidentified “source close to” Netanyahu said that “a clear majority in the American public and in Congress” agree with his opposition, the Times of Israel reported. “Netanyahu is expected to take the line that even though Obama has managed to preserve his right to uphold a veto, the deal with Iran still does not have legitimate public support,” according to Haaretz. The Jerusalem Post reported that a “senior official” in the Israeli government said that Netanyahu “has a responsibility to speak out against the deal” and “will continue to do so.” The Post added that “sources close to the prime minister” said that Netanyahu has no regrets about his battle against the deal, including his decision to speak before a joint session of Congress in March, which was widely seen as an affront to Obama. “The American people get it,” the sources said, according to The Post. “They understand the dangers to Israel. They understand the dangers to the United States. That’s why a clear majority believe the deal should be rejected, which is also reflected in Congress, where a clear majority seems prepared to reject the deal.” The deal, which was reached in July following negotiations between Iran and six world powers, trades sanctions relief for curbs on Iran’s nuclear program. The sources also insisted that the U.S.-Israel relationship is “strong” and that Netanyahu has “no doubt that the United States and Israel will continue to work together to address the enormous challenges confronting both our nations.” Despite the ongoing tensions between the two leaders, Netanyahu may meet with Obama in Washington in November, Israel’s Channel 2 reported Wednesday night. The two have not met face to face since October 2014.

News article:
By Jeffrey Heller September 3, 2015 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted on Thursday most Americans agreed with Israel over dangers posed by Iran, even as he lost a battle to persuade the U.S. Congress to reject Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers including Washington. In remarks at a Jewish New Year’s reception at the Foreign Ministry, Netanyahu made no direct mention of President Barack Obama’s victory on Wednesday in securing enough Senate votes to protect the July 14 agreement in Congress. But Netanyahu, who angered the Democratic White House by addressing Congress in March at the invitation of the Republican leaders as part of his campaign against the deal, seemed to suggest his efforts were not futile. Speaking of a need to preserve Israel’s traditionally close ties with Washington despite what he called “differences of opinion,” Netanyahu told the diplomatic staffers: “I must say, however, that the overwhelming majority of the American public sees eye-to-eye with us on the danger emanating from Iran.” He cited no evidence for his remark. A Reuters-Ipsos poll taken in the United States found that as of Sept. 1, 30 percent were in favor of the agreement, 30.7 percent against with 39.4 saying they did not know. The poll had a credibility interval of 2.6 percent. Israel’s message to ordinary Americans, Netanyahu said, would continue to be that “Iran is the enemy of the United States – it declares that openly – and Israel is a U.S. ally.” Ensuring the U.S. public understands that point will have “important ramifications for our security down the line,” Netanyahu said, according to an official statement. In an interview last Friday with the Forward, a U.S. Jewish newspaper and news website, Obama held out the prospect of enhanced military and intelligence cooperation with Israel once the deal with Iran is implemented. “There are always going to be arguments within families and among friends. And Israel isn’t just an ally, it’s not just a friend – it’s family,” Obama said. Netanyahu and other opponents of the pact say it gives Iran too much sanctions relief in exchange for an insufficient regime for inspecting Iran’s nuclear facilities. They worry Tehran will use a $50 billion “windfall” to finance Islamist militant groups that might threaten U.S. allies, including Israel. Last month Obama touted the deal as “the strongest non-proliferation agreement ever negotiated” and said that if Congress scuttled it, Tehran’s pathway to an atomic bomb would be accelerated and America’s international credibility severely damaged. Some U.S.-based pro-Israel groups have spent millions of dollars on campaigns urging Congress to reject it. But on Wednesday, Democratic Senator Barbara Mikulski said she would support the deal, bringing the list of backers in the Senate to 34 – enough to sustain Obama’s promised veto if the Republican-controlled Congress passes a disapproval resolution. Netanyahu’s critics have said his decision to address Congress at the Republicans’ behest only alienated potential Democratic opponents of the accord and ultimately foiled his efforts to sink the agreement.

Israel – Former Israeli Mossad spy chief Meir Dagan says it is time for Israel to stop criticizing the United States over the nuclear deal it and world powers struck with Iran. Speaking Monday at the International Institute for Counterterrorism’s annual conference in the coastal city of Herzliya, Dagan said: “The problem is Iran, not President Obama.” Dagan has been a fierce critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hard-line policies regarding Iran. He vocally opposed the prospect of an Israeli military strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities that Netanyahu is said to have supported. Dagan said Israel made a “strategic decision” to adopt a policy against the United States and “it is time to end it.” Dagan is a retired military general who headed Israel’s secretive Mossad agency from 2002-2011.

It is now clear that the Iranian nuclear deal will pass Congress. President Obama now has the 34 votes to override any Congressional objections, and is well on the way to being able to prevent any vote at all, if he can achieve the 41 votes needed for a filibuster. It would be logical that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu would now give up his fight against the Iran deal. But at a toast at Israel’s Foreign Ministry for the upcoming Jewish New Year, Netanyahu said he intends to keep fighting against the Iran agreement. “Even in the face of disputes, Israel must be mindful of its traditional allies, chiefly the United States,” Netanyahu said. “And although the majority of Americans see eye to eye with us in terms of the threat Iran poses, it is important that the American public understand the fact that Iran is an enemy of the United States and openly declares it.” “Israel and the United States are allies and this understanding has important implications for our continued security cooperation,” Netanyahu added. Polls show that most Israelis oppose the Iranian nuclear deal, which would lift most sanctions on Iran in exchange for curtailing its nuclear program. President Obama says it will keep Iran away from a bomb for at least 15 years. But many in Israel are skeptical, saying that Iran has lied to the international community in the past and is likely to do so again. Netanyahu’s campaign has deepened tensions between the US and Israel to one of the highest levels in recent history. An official from the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC is quoted in Israeli media as saying that Netanyahu’s speech in Congress last March was a bad decision. “As soon as he insisted on going ahead with this move, which was perceived as a Republican maneuver against the president, we lost a significant part of the Democratic party, without which it was impossible to block the agreement,” the official, who asked not to be named told the Walla News Agency. Former Israeli Knesset member Dov Lipman (an American-born rabbi) of the Yesh Atid party, which was part of the government coalition in the last government but is currently in opposition, said Netanyahu has made serious mistakes. “That speech in Congress made no sense in what was best for Israel,” Lipman told The Media Line. “We had Democratic congressmen begging us and saying, “don’t make this a partisan issue.” The moment he got up and put the Democrats in that position, we lost it.” Lipman said Netanyahu should admit defeat and try to move on. “We embarrassed the president and the secretary of state and ruined all of these relationships with Jewish organizations,” Lipman said. “It is a colossal failure and the deal is happening anyway.” Some Israeli analysts say that Netanyahu will not give up for several reasons. “Israeli politics are focused on security issues, not economic ones,” Reuven Chazan, a professor of political science at Hebrew University. “Netanyahu’s focus on Iran helped him win the Israeli election, and even if it’s a dead horse he’s going to beat it for political purposes.” But beyond that, he said that Netanyahu deeply believes that the Iran deal is a colossal mistake that lead to a nuclear Iran, rather than preventing that scenario. He says he has heard this from several in Netanyahu’s inner circle. “This is an almost Messianic quest in Netanyahu’s mind,” he said. “He perceives that he was put on this earth to save Israel from the Iranian threat.”

know very well what Israel is capable of doing. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has fired back at "warmonger" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for threatening Iran with "atomic annihilation" right from the regime's secretive atomic weapons facility.Speaking during a ceremony at the Dimona nuclear arms facility in the Negev desert on Wednesday, Netanyahu had claimed that the occupying entity faces threats from near and far."Those who threaten to wipe us out put themselves in a similar danger, and in any event will not achieve their goal," he said. "ButThey are familiar with our policy. Whoever tries to hurt us - we hurt them," said Netanyahu.Hours later, Zarif took to Twitter to respond to the hawkish Israeli premier's highly aggressive threat, which came on the same day that the world nations were observing the International Day against Nuclear Tests.tweeted the top Iranian diplomat, describing Netanyahu's statements as "beyond shameless.", but its policy is to neither confirm nor deny that it has atomic bombs. The Tel Aviv regime is estimated to have 200 to 400 nuclear warheads in its arsenal.(NPT) -- whose aim is to prevent the spread of nuclear arms and weapons technology - in defiance of international pressure.Marking the International Day against Nuclear Tests, Foreign Minister Zarif had earlier in the day slammed the Israeli regime and its stalwart supporter, the US, as the sole possessor of nuclear bombs in the region and the "sole user" of atomic weapons in the world, respectively."Let's also remember that," Zarif said in a tweet.Elsewhere in his comments,The Israeli military, Netanyahu said, "will continue acting with full determination and with full might against" what he called Iran's attempts "to station forces and advanced weapons systems in Syria."Worried over Syria's gains against terrorists,that have been suffering defeats on the battlefield.The regime has also been providing weapons to anti-Damascus militants as well as medical treatment to Takfiri elements wounded in Syria.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened his cabinet meeting Wednesday by stressing that the world must unite against not only against the threat of Islamic State, but also against that of Iran. “It is doing so to a certain extent against Islamic State but it is not doing so against Iran,” he said. “On the contrary, what we are seeing is that while Iran is sending terrorist cells to Europe, European leaders are appeasing – and reconciling with – Iran, in the same week that the terrorist cells were due to carry out their operations, which we helped thwart. This is unacceptable.” Netanyahu was presumably referring to intelligence the Mossad passed on to authorities in France, Germany, and Belgium leading to arrests of a cell headed by an Iranian diplomat that planned to bomb a June 30 conference organized by an Iranian dissident group, the People’s Mujahedeen of Iran. The Israeli leader reiterated that “the appeasement of Iran abets the relentless assault on the values and security of the free societies, and the time has come for Western governments to join the strong and clear effort by the Trump administration against the terror regime in Tehran.” The prime minister added that radical Shiites and radical Sunnis were both working to destroy Israel and destroy Western society. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “The world is being challenged by radical Islam, radical Shiites on the one hand led by Iran, and radical Sunnis led by Islamic State, but both have a single goal – to eliminate the free societies, as we recognize, to eliminate Israel and in the end to eliminate the West and others as well,” he said. Netanyahu also took the opportunity to mark the 17th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks. “Yesterday we marked 17 years since the awful terrorist attack against the American people at the Twin Towers in New York and at the Pentagon in [Greater] Washington,” he said. “This operation was carried out by Al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda has passed the torch to Islamic State, even as Iran also promotes international terrorism.” Advertisement The prime minister reiterated his belief that the US “made the correct decision” in closing the Palestine Liberation Organization mission in Washington, DC, on Monday. “The Palestinians refuse to enter negotiations with Israel even as they attack Israel with false claims in international forums,” he said. “Israel very much appreciates the Trump administration decision and supports American actions that are designed to make it clear to the Palestinians that the refusal to enter into negotiations with Israel and the unbridled attacks against Israel will not only not advance peace but will certainly not make things better for the Palestinians.”

News article:
LONDON: Iran has asked the United Nations to condemn Israeli threats against Tehran and to bring Israel's nuclear programme under its supervision, state media reported on Thursday. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used a visit to a secretive Israeli atomic reactor in late August to warn the country’s enemies that it has the means to destroy them, in what appeared to be a veiled reference to its assumed nuclear arsenal. "The United Nations’ members should not turn a blind eye to these threats and must take firms actions to eliminate all Israeli nuclear weapons," Fars news agency quoted Iran's ambassador to the United Nations Gholamali Khoshrou as saying in letters to the U.N. secretary general and the security council. Khoshrou asked the United Nations to force Israel to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and bring its nuclear programme under supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a UN atomic watchdog. Israel, which is outside the NPT, neither confirms nor denies having the bomb, a decades-old “ambiguity” policy that it says keeps hostile neighbours in check while avoiding the kind of public provocations that can spark regional arms races. Israel is trying to lobby world powers to follow the United States in exiting their 2015 deal with Iran that capped the Islamic Republic’s nuclear capabilities in return for lifting of sanctions. The Israelis deem the agreement insufficient for denying their arch-foe the means to eventually get the bomb - something that Tehran, which is a signatory to the 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), denies wanting. Since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has preached Israel’s destruction. It backs the Lebanese militia Hezbollah and the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas. Its reinforcement of Damascus during Syria’s civil war is seen by the Netanyahu government as a further Iranian deployment on Israel’s borders. (

News article:
Iran has asked the United Nations to oversee Israel’s secretive nuclear programme and condemns its threats against the Islamic republic, state media reported on Thursday. In August, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a speech from the Dimona atomic reactor, warning the country’s foes that it has the capabilities to destroy them. He was making a reference to Israel’s suspected nuclear programme. The country never admits or denies the existence of a nuclear programme and maintains a policy of “strategic ambiguity” so as not to allow any sensitive information to fall into enemy hands. “The United Nations members should not turn a blind eye to these threats and must take firms actions to eliminate all Israeli nuclear weapons,” Fars news agency quoted Iran's ambassador to the United Nations Gholamali Khoshrou as saying in letters to the UN secretary general and the UN Security Council. Mr Khoshrou asked the United Nations to force Israel to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and bring its nuclear programme under supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a UN atomic watchdog. Israel, which is outside the NPT, neither confirms nor denies having the bomb, a decades-old ambiguity policy that it says keeps hostile neighbours in check while avoiding the kind of public provocations that can spark regional arms races. Iran regularly threatens Israel with destruction but Mr Netanyahu appeared to make a rare admission about his country’s nuclear arsenal. “Those who threaten to wipe us out put themselves in a similar danger, and in any event will not achieve their goal,” he said at the ceremony. On Thursday, Israel said it is upgrading and reinforcing its nuclear facilities to withstand attacks to counter Iranian threats to strike the Israel’s nuclear sites. “We cannot ignore the repeated and explicit threats, made by Iran and its proxies, to attack Israel’s nuclear sites,” Zeev Snir, the head of the country’s Atomic Energy Commission, said in a speech Tuesday to the 62nd General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. “These outrageous threats require Israel to take action and continue to protect and defend its nuclear facilities.” __________ Read more: Hezbollah leader says group will stay in Syria until further notice Hezbollah is flaunting its support for Yemen’s Houthis __________ Iran’s own nuclear ambitions have been the centre of international diplomacy for years. After Israeli lobbying, the US earlier this year withdrew from the landmark nuclear deal signed between Tehran and world powers in July 2015. That deal swapped limits on Tehran’s nuclear programme for the lifting of crippling international sanctions. Israel is now lobbying other world powers to follow US President Donald Trump in leaving the agreement. UAE Ambassador to the IAEA, Hamad Alkaabi, told the nuclear body on Thursday that the nuclear deal was not satisfactory. “In relationship to the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action) concluded with Iran, my country, like many, has hoped that such Agreement would address long held nuclear concerns and moderate Iran’s regional behavior,” he said. “Unfortunately, this was not the case. We call on Iran to build further confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear activities and to refrain from the actions that continue to threaten the peace and stability of the region.” Israel believes the agreement is insufficient for denying their arch-foe the means to eventually get the bomb. It views Iran as its number one national security concern. The Iranian regime backs the Lebanese militia Hezbollah and the Palestinian movement Hamas. Both groups have fought four wars with Israel since 2006. Its reinforcement of Damascus during Syria’s seven-year civil war is seen by the Netanyahu government as a further Iranian deployment on Israel’s borders.

(JTA) — Israel is upgrading and reinforcing its nuclear sites in light of “repeated and explicit threats” made by Iran and its proxies to attack them, a nuclear official said. Zeev Snir, the director-general of Israel’s Atomic Energy Commission, addressed the issue in a speech Tuesday to a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA. The address was provided to the Israeli media. “These outrageous threats require Israel to take action and continue to protect and defend its nuclear facilities,” Snir said. “These facilities are constantly upgraded and reinforced, in line with IAEA safety guidelines, in order to withstand any attack.” Israel rarely discusses its nuclear activities publicly. Snir called for regional cooperation on nuclear security and safety, but noted that while Israel has “repeatedly expressed its willingness to collaborate with all of its neighbors” on nuclear safely and security, the Jewish state is not recognized by several Middle East countries and Iran has openly called for Israel’s destruction. He called on the IAEA to “conduct a robust verification of Iran’s clandestine nuclear activities,” adding that the covert Iranian nuclear weapons program is “a documented fact.” “Israel has repeatedly underlined the importance of confronting Iran with its lies and concealment efforts,” he said. Snir said the new information recently revealed by Israel “conclusively proves that Iranian activities were part of a well-orchestrated plan to continue the development of nuclear weapons.” He also spoke of Syria’s “undeclared, secretive military nuclear reactor at Dair Alzour,” which Israel bombed more than a decade ago.

(Adds Israel's statement) By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin and Dan Williams LONDON/JERUSALEM, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Iran asked the United Nations to condemn what it described as Israeli nuclear threats against it on Thursday, while Israel said it was stepping up security around its atomic sites as a precaution against threats from Tehran and its regional allies. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used a visit to a secretive Israeli atomic reactor in August to warn the country's enemies that it has the means to destroy them, in what appeared to be a reference to its assumed nuclear arsenal. "The United Nations' members should not turn a blind eye to these threats and must take firms actions to eliminate all Israeli nuclear weapons," Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Gholamali Khoshrou said in letters to the U.N. secretary general and the security council, was quoted as saying by Fars news agency. Khoshrou asked the United Nations to force Israel to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and bring its nuclear programme under supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a U.N. atomic watchdog. The director general of Israel's Atomic Energy Commission said on Tuesday that Iran and Syria posed significant proliferation threats to the region and called for U.N. action at the 62nd General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency now taking place in Vienna. In a statement on Thursday, director general Zeev Snir said: "We cannot ignore the repeated and explicit threats, made by Iran and its proxies, to attack Israel's nuclear sites. These outrageous threats, require Israel to take immediate action and continue to protect and defend its nuclear facilities." Israel, which is outside the NPT, neither confirms nor denies having a nuclear arsenal, a decades-old "ambiguity" policy. It is trying to lobby world powers to follow the United States in withdrawing from the 2015 deal with Iran that capped the Islamic Republic's nuclear capabilities in return for lifting of sanctions. The Israelis say the agreement does not do enough to denying their arch-foe the means to eventually build a bomb. Tehran, which is a signatory to the 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), denies wanting to so. Netanyahu gave details in April of what he said was evidence of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons programme. Iran called the documents fake. Snir said the IAEA must conduct a robust verification of Iran's "clandestine activities" and also of an undeclared, secretive military nuclear reactor that he said Syria has built at Dair Alzour. Since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has called for Israel's destruction. Tehran backs the Lebanese militia Hezbollah and the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas. Its reinforcement of Damascus during Syria's civil war is seen by the Netanyahu government as a further Iranian deployment on Israel's borders. Israel has been a member of the IAEA since its establishment in 1957, and Iran since 1958.

Kazem Gharibabadi made the remarks at the 62nd Annual Regular Session of the IAEA General Conference, which is underway at the Vienna International Centre (VIC) in the Austrian capital from September 17 to 21. He pointed out that nuclear disarmament as one of the main objectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, despite being one of the highest priorities of the international community, has unfortunately not seen significant progress over the past 50 years. With respect to the Middle East Nuclear Weapon Free Zone (MENWFZ), a UN-driven proposal to prohibit nuclear weapons in the region since 1980, he said that lack of political will to implement international decisions is a matter of concern. The Iranian representative further referred to the Israeli regime’s nuclear weapons and its threatening behavior towards its neighbors in the Middle East, calling for pressuring the regime to join the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as an urgent necessity. He then criticized the IAEA for giving in to Israeli regime’s pressures and for not following up on Israel’s dangerous nuclear activities. Elsewhere in his remarks, Gharibabadi referred to the US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry’s recent comments on Iran’s nuclear program, calling for a halt to US unilateralism and its disrespect for international agreements. He further lashed out at the Saudi Arabia and UAE for committing crimes against humanity in Yemen while siding with Israel in falsely accusing Iran of pursuing nuclear weapons.

Speaking at the 62nd Annual Session of the ongoing IAEA General Conference in Vienna, Gharibabadi charged Israel with threatening its neighbors, pointed to its possession of nuclear weapons, and chastised the IAEA for giving in to Israeli pressure and not following up on what he said were the country's "dangerous" nuclear activities. According to the ambassador, little progress has been made on nuclear disarmament, one of the NPT's major stated objectives, in the fifty years since the treaty was signed. Gharibabadi also pointed to the Middle East Nuclear Weapon Freeze Zone idea, a UN project dating back to 1970s aimed at prohibiting nuclear weapons in the region, and how this proposal too has suffered from a "lack of political will."

News article:
Iran asked the United Nations to condemn what it described as Israeli nuclear threats against it yesterday, while Israel said it was stepping up security around its atomic sites as a precaution against threats from Tehran and its regional allies. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used a visit to a secretive Israeli atomic reactor in August to warn the country's enemies that it has the means to destroy them, in what appeared to be a reference to its assumed nuclear arsenal. "The United Nations ‘members should not turn a blind eye to these threats and must take firms actions to eliminate all Israeli nuclear weapons," Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Gholamali Khoshrou said in letters to the U.N. secretary general and the security council, was quoted as saying by Fars news agency. Khoshrou asked the United Nations to force Israel to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and bring its nuclear program under supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a U.N. atomic watchdog. The director general of Israel's Atomic Energy Commission said on Tuesday that Iran and Syria posed significant proliferation threats to the region and called for U.N. action at the 62nd General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency now taking place in Vienna. In a statement yesterday, director general Zeev Snir said: "We cannot ignore the repeated and explicit threats, made by Iran and its proxies, to attack Israel's nuclear sites. These outrageous threats, require Israel to take immediate action and continue to protect and defend its nuclear facilities." Israel, which is outside the NPT, neither confirms nor denies having a nuclear arsenal, a decades-old "ambiguity" policy. It is trying to lobby world powers to follow the United States in withdrawing from the 2015 deal with Iran that capped the Islamic Republic's nuclear capabilities in return for lifting of sanctions. The Israelis say the agreement does not do enough to denying their arch-foe the means to eventually build a bomb. Tehran, which is a signatory to the 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), denies wanting to so. Netanyahu gave details in April of what he said was evidence of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons program. Iran called the documents fake. Snir said the IAEA must conduct a robust verification of Iran's "clandestine activities" and also of an undeclared, secretive military nuclear reactor that he said Syria has built at Deir el-Zour. Since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has called for Israel's destruction. Tehran backs the Lebanese militia Hezbollah and the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas. Its reinforcement of Damascus during Syria's civil war is seen by the Netanyahu government as a further Iranian deployment on Israel's borders. Israel has been a member of the IAEA since its establishment in 1957, and Iran since 1958.

News article:
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday described Israel as “the most terrifying threat to the peace and stability of the region and the world.” Follow Ynetnews on Facebook STRONG> and Twitter “Israel, which has a nuclear arsenal and is blatantly threatening others with nuclear annihilation, is the most terrifying threat to the peace and stability of the region and the world,” the Iranian president said. “The countless crimes by Israel against the Palestinians would not have been able to take place without assistance and support from the US,” Rouhani said in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly. President Rouhani (Photo: Reuters) He also added that the passage of the years cannot justify what he described as the “continued occupation.” Rouhani further emphasized that the US decision to transfer its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem was a flagrant example of Washington undermining regional peace. He also slammed Israel’s recent passage of the Nation-State Law was another clear example of the country being an apartheid state. Rouhani criticized Washington for its hostile policy toward his country and said the US approach was doomed to failure. He said the United States had waged "economic war" against Iran by reimposing unilateral sanctions, which were lifted under the country's 2015 multinational nuclear deal in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear program. "The United States policy vis-a -vis the Islamic Republic of Iran has been wrong from the beginning, and its approach of resisting the wishes of the Iranian people as manifested in numerous elections is doomed to failure," Rouhani said. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the pact in May, and his administration reimposed sanctions on Iran in August. Harsher sanctions on Iran's oil and banking sector are expected in November. "The economic war that the United States has initiated under the rubric of new sanctions not only targets the Iranian people but also entails harmful repercussions for the people of other countries, and that war has caused a disruption in the state of global trade," Rouhani said. "What Iran says is clear: no war, no sanctions, no threats, no bullying; just acting according to the law and the fulfillment of obligations." Mounting pressure from the Trump administration combined with discontent among many Iranians at the state of the economy are rattling the Islamic Republic, with little sign that its leaders have the answers, officials and analysts say. The rial has lost 40 percent of its value against the US dollar since April. Iran has blamed US sanctions for the currency's fall, saying the measures amount to a "political, psychological and economic" war on Tehran. Threat for threat To pile on the pain, Washington says all countries must end crude imports from Iran by November 4, hitting the oil sales that generate 60 percent of the country's income. Iran says this level of cuts will never happen. Tehran has suggested it could take military action in the Gulf to block other countries' oil exports in retaliation for US sanctions intended to halt its sales of crude. Washington maintains a fleet in the Gulf that protects oil shipping routes. "The security of the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz has always been important for us ... we will confront any and all disruptive efforts in this critical waterway in the future," said Rouhani. The Strait of Hormuz is a strategic artery linking Middle East crude producers to key markets in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America and beyond. A third of the world's seaborne oil passes through the strait in southern Iran. Trump, in his annual UN speech, said he would keep up economic pressure on Tehran to try to force a change in its behavior. But Rouhani said Iran had no intention of succumbing to the US pressure. "The United States' understanding of international relations is authoritarian. ... Its understanding of power, not of legal and legitimate authority, is reflected in bullying and imposition," Rouhani said. "No state and nation can be brought to the negotiating table by force," said the pragmatist president, adding that Iran did not want any war. President Trump (Photo: EPA) "Our proposal is clear: commitment for commitment; violation for violation; threat for threat; and step for step, instead of talk for talk," he said. Rouhani expressed Iran's willingness to improve ties with the regional countries. Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia has been at loggerheads with Shi'ite Iran for decades, fighting a long-running proxy war in the Middle East and beyond that has influenced conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. Riyadh and its Gulf allies have hailed Trump's decision to exit the nuclear deal and to reimpose sanctions on Tehran, reflecting their concern about Iran's influence in the region. "We believe in the formation of a collective mechanism for the Persian Gulf region with the presence and participation of all regional countries," Rouhani said.

Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday said Israel was the greatest threat to world peace, and responded to a fiery speech by US President Donald Trump by claiming the United States was plotting to overthrow Tehran’s regime. “The innumerable crimes of Israel against the Palestinians would not have been possible without the political and military assistance” of the US, Rouhani charged in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly. He accused Israel of “blatantly threatening others with nuclear annihilation” and said the Jewish state constitutes “the most daunting threat to regional and global peace.” Trump had earlier in the day urged the international community to isolate Iran, accusing the Tehran regime of sowing “chaos, death and destruction,” ahead of the administration’s plans to reimpose harsh sanctions against the Islamic Republic on November 5. “We cannot allow the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism to possess the planet’s most dangerous weapons,” Trump said, citing Iran’s “threatening Israel with annihilation” and chants of “death to America.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “We ask all nations to isolate Iran’s regime as long as its aggression continues and we ask all nations to support Iran’s people as they struggle to reclaim their religious and righteous destiny,” he said. Rouhani defended the 2015 nuclear deal that put curbs on his country’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, and decried sanctions reimposed by the Trump administration as part of its pullout from the accord. “Unlawful unilateral sanctions in themselves constitute a form of economic terrorism,” he said, adding that the US approach to Iran was “doomed to failure.” Advertisement “The government of the United States of America, at least the current administration, seems determined to render all international institutions ineffectual,” he added. Trump withdrew in May from the nuclear deal, which was forged under his predecessor, Barack Obama, in 2015. The administration scolded the deal for its sunset clauses that allow certain restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program to expire, its failure to prevent Iranian ballistic missile testing, and the degree of access it provides for inspectors into Iran’s military sites. Trump’s pullout from the deal was met with intense criticism from world leaders, especially those of the other countries — Britain, France, Germany, China, and Russia — that brokered the accord. In his speech, Trump also championed the decision to move his country’s embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, saying the US was “committed to a future of peace and stability in the region, including peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. That aim is advanced, not harmed, by acknowledging the obvious facts.” Rouhani called Trump’s decision to move the US diplomatic mission “abhorrent,” and said recent Knesset legislation defining Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people was “racist” and a “manifestation of apartheid.” Advertisement Rouhani also rejected Trump’s offer to hold bilateral talks with Tehran, saying, “On what basis and criteria can we enter into an agreement with an administration misbehaving like this?” He went on to charge that the US was plotting regime change in Iran. “It is ironic that the US government doesn’t even conceal its plan for overthrowing the same government it invites to talks,” he said. Israel’s UN ambassador Danny Danon called Rouhani’s speech “detached from reality,” saying that while he was “trying to preach about morality to Israel,” Iran’s actions were spreading “terror around the world in a long and bloody path across continents. “Had it not been for Tehran’s financial support, Hamas could not have dug terror tunnels into Israel and Hezbollah would not have built huge stockpiles of weapons,” he said.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed on Thursday that Iran was concealing a “secret atomic warehouse” in Tehran and tore into European countries for turning a blind eye to Iranian nuclear activity. The Associated Press reported that Netanyahu made the accusation during a speech at the United Nations General Assembly. He held up maps and photos of what he claimed was a rug-cleaning operation being used as a front to house “massive amounts of equipment and material from Iran’s secret weapons program.” {mosads}Netanyahu said Israel provided the information about the alleged warehouse with the International Atomic Energy Agency and some other intelligence agencies, the AP reported. Iranian officials did not immediately respond to Netanyahu’s claims, according to media reports. The prime minister went on to accuse European countries of “appeasing” Iran by continuing to do business with the country and remaining committed to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbing its nuclear program. Netanyahu, who has been among the most vocal international critics of the nuclear pact, previously raised evidence that he claimed showed Iran had continued to develop its nuclear arsenal despite the agreement. While Netanyahu portrayed that April announcement as a “significant development” and further reason for the U.S. to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in 2011 that it had credible evidence showing Iran was doing nuclear weapons work under a structured program through 2003 and that work may have continued past that. Days after Netanyahu’s announcement, the U.S. withdrew from the agreement. The Trump administration reimposed sanctions on Iran last month, with more expected to be implemented later this year. In his speech to the U.N. General Assembly, President Trump lashed out at Iran and called on other nations to isolate the regime. “We cannot allow the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism to possess the planet’s most dangerous weapons. We cannot allow a regime that chants ‘Death to America,’ and that threatens Israel with annihilation, to possess the means to deliver a nuclear warhead to any city on Earth,” Trump said. “Just can’t do it.”

The Associated Press reported that Netanyahu made the accusation during a speech at the United Nations General Assembly. He held up maps and photos of what he claimed was a rug-cleaning operation being used as a front to house “massive amounts of equipment and material from Iran’s secret weapons program.” {mosads}Netanyahu said Israel provided the information about the alleged warehouse with the International Atomic Energy Agency and some other intelligence agencies, the AP reported. Iranian officials did not immediately respond to Netanyahu’s claims, according to media reports. The prime minister went on to accuse European countries of “appeasing” Iran by continuing to do business with the country and remaining committed to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbing its nuclear program. Netanyahu, who has been among the most vocal international critics of the nuclear pact, previously raised evidence that he claimed showed Iran had continued to develop its nuclear arsenal despite the agreement. While Netanyahu portrayed that April announcement as a “significant development” and further reason for the U.S. to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in 2011 that it had credible evidence showing Iran was doing nuclear weapons work under a structured program through 2003 and that work may have continued past that. Days after Netanyahu’s announcement, the U.S. withdrew from the agreement. The Trump administration reimposed sanctions on Iran last month, with more expected to be implemented later this year. In his speech to the U.N. General Assembly, President Trump lashed out at Iran and called on other nations to isolate the regime. “We cannot allow the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism to possess the planet’s most dangerous weapons. We cannot allow a regime that chants ‘Death to America,’ and that threatens Israel with annihilation, to possess the means to deliver a nuclear warhead to any city on Earth,” Trump said. “Just can’t do it.”

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (C) speaks during the weekly cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem, on July 12, 2015. (Xinhua/JINI/POOL/Emil Salman) UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday said that Iran has hidden "massive amounts of equipment and materiel," indicating that the country is eyeing nuclear weapon program. Speaking at the General Debate of the UN General Assembly, Netanyahu said that nearly 15 kilograms of radioactive material had been stored in the warehouse in the Turquzabad district of Tehran. "Today I am disclosing for the first time that Iran has another secret facility in Tehran, a secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and materiel from Iran's secret nuclear program," Netanyahu said. This site contained as much as 300 tonnes of nuclear-related equipment and materiel, he said, noting Iran hasn't abandoned its goal to develop nuclear weapons. While not detailing what the material was, Netanyahu urged the International Atomic Energy Agency, a UN atomic watchdog, to inspect the location immediately. Netanyahu also criticized Europe for setting up a legal entity to bypass U.S. re-imposed sanctions, saying such action amounts to an appeasement with Iran. On Monday, European Union foreign and security policy chief Federica Mogherini said that the EU will set up a legal entity to facilitate legitimate financial transactions with Iran in light of the U.S. withdrawal from the international agreement on Tehran's nuclear program and the re-imposition of sanctions. On Wednesday, leaders of France and Britain, while speaking at the UN Security Council (UNSC) meeting on non-proliferation, vowed to defend the Iran nuke deal. All these showed that Washington, by exiting the deal and sanctioning Iran, has put itself in isolation, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said. Netanyahu on April 30 revealed what he called a "great intelligence achievement" about Iran's nuclear program, saying that he had proof that Iran had been seeking nuclear power even after it signed an agreement curbing its nuclear program in 2015. However, Iranian Foreign Ministry later denounced his nuclear allegations against Iran as a "worthless show" and "ridiculous propagandist presentations" that were "merely aimed at spreading lies and deception." Tensions between Iran and Israel, as well as the United States, have been running high this year. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the United States will impose "tougher than ever" sanctions on Iran after the punitive actions against the country slated in November this year. In May, Trump announced Washington's withdrawal from the landmark Iranian nuclear deal. Since then, the Trump administration has slapped a number of sanctions on Iran while vowing to apply more in November.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened action against Iran after accusing the regime of hiding nuclear-related material at a warehouse in Tehran. He claimed Iran had a 'secret atomic warehouse' in Tehran in an address to the UN General Assembly on Thursday, which he said proved it had not abandoned its nuclear weapons programme. Netanyahu held up a map and a photograph of an outwardly innocuous looking in the Turquzabad district of Tehran, which he said was concealed as a rug-cleaning operation. Iran 'hasn't abandoned its goal to develop nuclear weapons,' Netanyahu told the UN General Assembly, where his annual appearance has frequently focused on Israel's chief enemy, the Islamic republic. 'Israel will never let a regime that calls for our destruction to develop nuclear weapons. Not now, not in 10 years, not ever,' he said. 'Israel will do whatever it must do to defend itself against Iran's aggression. What Iran hides, Israel will find.' Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has revealed what he says is a secret Iranian nuclear weapons storage site Netanyahu's disclosure - which he presented as a big reveal on the international community's biggest stage - came four months after Israel announced the existence of what it said was a 'half-ton' of Iranian nuclear documents obtained by Israeli intelligence in the Shourabad neighborhood near Tehran. Israel said the cache proved that Iranian leaders covered up their nuclear weapons program before signing the nuclear agreement. Iran hasn't acknowledged the alleged seizure. 'You have to ask yourself a question: Why did Iran keep a secret atomic archive and a secret atomic warehouse?' he asked. 'What Iran hides, Israel will find.' The Israeli leader also lambasted Iran's ballistic missile activity, identifying three locations near Beirut airport where he said Lebanon's Hezbollah was converting missiles. 'In Lebanon, Iran is directing Hezbollah to build secret sites to convert inaccurate projectiles into precision-guided missiles, missiles that can target deep inside Israel within an accuracy of 10 metres (yards),' he said. He accused Hezbollah of 'deliberately using the innocent people of Beirut as human shields.' Netanyahu added: 'Israel know what you are doing, Israel knows where you are doing it, and Israel will not let you get away with it.' Speaking about Iran's 'secret atomic warehouse', he said: 'In May we exposed the site of Iran's secret atomic archive. Today I'm revealing the site of a second facility, Iran's secret atomic warehouse. 'Iran has not abandoned its goal to develop nuclear weapons.... Rest assured that will not happen.

He said Iranian officials had started cleaning out the atomic warehouse, but still had a lot of work to do because they 'have had at least 15 ship containers, they're gigantic, 15 ship containers full of nuclear-related equipment and materials stored there,' he said. 'This means that this site contained as much as 300 tonnes - 300 tonnes - of nuclear-related equipment and materiel,' he said. France, Britain, Germany, China and Russia have stayed in the deal, vowing to save it despite the restoration of US sanctions on Iran. Netanyahu noted that Israel had long opposed the multinational agreement with Iran and accused the European powers of appeasing Iran. 'Have these European leaders learned nothing from history? Will they ever wake up?' he said. Israel considers Iran its biggest threat, citing Tehran's calls for Israel's destruction, its support for hostile militant organizations like Hezbollah and Iran's development of long-range missiles.

Israel applauded Trump's decision, but many other nations lamented it as jeopardising what they saw as the best chance for keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear-armed power. 'Instead of coddling Iran's dictators,' other countries should support the sanctions, Netanyahu said to applause. The 2015 Iran nuclear deal came after years of Western sanctions over the country's contested atomic program. The West long has feared it could be used to build nuclear bombs. Iran long has denied seeking atomic weapons. Under terms of the deal, Iran is allowed to keep documents and other research. The deal strictly limits how many centrifuges Iran can use and how large of a low-enriched uranium stockpile the country can keep. Netanyahu's revelation came shortly after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas took Israel and the US to task in his own speech, declaring that his people's rights 'are not up for bargaining' and that the US was undermining the long-discussed two-state solution. But Netanyahu devoted less attention to his country's long-running conflict with the Palestinians. Abbas halted ties with Trump's administration in December after the US recognised contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Palestinians have said a pending US peace plan will be dead on arrival because of that and other recent US moves that Palestinians see as favouring Israel.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed before the UN General Assembly on Thursday “another secret atomic facility” in Iran, some four months after he presented what he said was “conclusive proof” of a secret project underway in Iran for the development of nuclear weapons. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook STRONG> and Twitter “What I’m about to say has not been shown publicly before ... Today I’m revealing the site of a second facility, Iran’s secret atomic warehouse,” he said after a brief introduction praising his country under his leadership for opposing the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. US President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in May, making way for the reimposition of crippling sanctions that have devastated Iran’s currency and which threaten to ravage its economy. The new site Netanyahu identified sits a short distance from Shourabad where the Mossad pinched a trove of documents and evidence showing that Iran had archived its nuclear materials despite the nuclear deal. PM Netanyahu addresses UN General Assembly (צילום: UN Web TV) X “When I spoke here 3 years ago Israel stood alone among the nations. Of the nearly 200 countries that sit in this hall, only Israel openly opposed the nuclear deal with Iran. We oppose it because it threatens our future, even our very survival,” the prime minister said. “We opposed it because the deal paved Iran’s path to a nuclear arsenal and the lifting of the sanction has fueled Iran’s campaign of carnage and conquest throughout the Middle East. We opposed it because the deal was based on a fundamental lie … Israel exposed that lie.” Continuing what has become a traditional characteristic of presenting visuals during his UN speeches, Netanyahu said “Let me show you exactly what the secret atomic warehouse looks like. Here it is,” while holding up a picture of satellite and up-close images. According to Netanyahu, the second secret site was right near a rug-cleaning store, which he quipped may now be radioactive. There was no immediate official response from Tehran. Iran's mission to the UN did not respond to a request for comment. Iran's state-run, English-language Press TV channel carried Netanyahu's remarks live, but cut away after he made the allegation about the nuclear warehouse. PM Netanyahu shows satellite images of 'another atomic facility in Iran' (Photo: AFP) "Since we raided the atomic archive, they’ve been busy cleaning out the atomic warehouse. Just last month they cleared out 15kg of radioactive material … They took it out and they spread it around Tehran in order to hide the evidence," he claimed. He also said Israel shared the information with the UN atomic watchdog, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment. "The IAEA has not demanded to inspect a single site discovered in that secret archive. So given this inaction, I decided to reveal today something else that we have shared with the IAEA and a few intelligence agencies," he explained. Listing a legion of threats posed by Iran and its Lebanon-based terror proxy group Hezbollah, which he said was acquiring the technical know-how from Tehran to convert non-precision missiles into precision missiles to hit Israeli cities, Netanyahu said that he had a message for “the tyrants of Tehran.” “Israel knows what you're doing and Israel knows where you are doing it,” he declared. "What Iran hides, Israel will find.’ Netanyahu said that over the last year, Hezbollah has attempted to build an infrastructure for the conversion of surface-to-surface missiles into precision missiles near an airport in Beirut. In a similar vein to his message to Iran, Netanyahu issued a warning to Hezbollah. "I have a message for Hezbollah today: Israel also knows what you’re doing. Israel knows where you are doing it and Israel will not let you get away with it." PM shows satellite images of precision missiles facility (Photo: AFP) The prime minister’s speech comes on the heels of a diplomatic spat with Russia after Syria accidentally shot down a Russian spy plane while attempting to repel an IAF strike in Latakia. Since the incident last week, Israel has said that it will not be inhibited by the adverse political fallout from continuing to attack targets to prevent Iranian military entrenchment in Syria or the transfer of advanced weapons to Hezbollah—a message that Netanyahu used the podium to reiterate. “Israel will do whatever it must do to defend itself against Iran’s aggression. We will continue to act against you in Syria, we will act against you in Lebanon and we will continue to act against you in Iraq ... wherever, whenever, to defend our state and to defend out people,” he vowed. Accusing Iran of using money that poured into its coffers following the lifting of economic sanctions in the wake of the nuclear deal, Netanyahu said that Tehran “used the money to fuel its vast war machine.” PM Netanyahu at UNGA (Photo: AFP) But Iran’s aggression, the prime minister said, was not confined to the Middle East, asserting that it had spread both into New York and Europe. Despite the threats posed by Iran to the European continent, Netanyahu said that its nations were still “appeasing” and "coddling" the Islamic republic by seeking to mitigate the financial impact of US sanctions. "I’m an historian’s son, I have to ask. I ask not merely as an historian’s son, I ask it as a Jew, as a citizen of the world, as someone who’s lived through the 20th century: Have these European leaders learned nothing from history? Will they ever wake up?" he asked. “Well, in Israel, we don’t need a wakeup call because Iran threatens us every day. Because despite the best of hope, and there were many hopes around the nuclear deal, this deal did not push war further away. It brought war ever closer to our borders,” Netanyahu said. But Netanyahu did say that the Iran nuclear deal had made one significant, positive contribution to the MIddle East. “I have an important confession to make. This may surprise you. But I have to admit that the Iran deal has had one positive consequence … By empowering Iran, it brought Israel and many Arab states closer together than ever before, in an intimacy and friendship that I’ve not seen in my lifetime and that would have been unimaginable years ago,” he said while pounding the rostrum. Netanyahu also used the end of his speech to criticize the people who have objected to Israel’s recent passage of the Nation-State Law, which Abbas said would lead to an official apartheid system. "Israel is called racist for making Hebrew the official language? … When Israel is declared an apartheid state for declaring itself the nation-state of the Jewish people, it is downright preposterous," he shouted. "There are more than 50 countries here that have crosses or crescents on their flags,” he pointed out, stressing that those countries are inhabited by people from many faiths. “Only Israel is denigrated,” he said, for celebrating its national heritage. “Here at the UN, Israel is absurdly accused of racism … Here at the UN, Israel is shamefully accused of apartheid. Here at the UN, Israel is outrageously accused of ethnic cleansing. It’s the same old anti-Semitism with a brand new face,” he said, prompting a round of applause from supporters. The Israeli leader slammed Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas for lambasting Israel on the podium just moments earlier, citing examples of hypocrisy in Abbas’s accusations of racism against Israel. “President Abbas, you should know better. You write a dissertation denying the Holocaust. Your PA imposes death sentences on Palestinians for selling land to Jews,” he said. He also highlighted the PA’s policy of paying Palestinian terrorists for killing Jews in Israel. “President Abbas, you proudly pay Palestinian terrorists who murder Jews. In fact the more they slay, the more you pay. That’s in their law too, and you condemn Israel’s morality? You call Israel racist? This is not the way to peace,” he vented. Netanyahu’s remarks to the UN came a day after Trump made his first public endorsement of a two-state solution to resolve the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Speaking before the prime minister, President Abbas told the UN General Assembly that Jerusalem "is not for sale" while urging President Trump to rescind his decisions recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and cutting aid to the Palestinians, which he said had undermined the two-state solution to the Middle East conflict. "I renew my call to President Trump to rescind his decisions and decrees regarding Jerusalem, refugees and settlements."

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed before the UN General Assembly on Thursday “another secret atomic facility” in Iran, some four months after he presented what he said was “conclusive proof” of a secret project underway in Iran for the development of nuclear weapons. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook STRONG> and Twitter “What I’m about to say has not been shown publicly before ... Today I’m revealing the site of a second facility, Iran’s secret atomic warehouse,” he said after a brief introduction praising his country under his leadership for opposing the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. US President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in May, making way for the reimposition of crippling sanctions that have devastated Iran’s currency and which threaten to ravage its economy. The new site Netanyahu identified sits a short distance from Shourabad where the Mossad pinched a trove of documents and evidence showing that Iran had archived its nuclear materials despite the nuclear deal. PM Netanyahu addresses UN General Assembly (צילום: UN Web TV) X “When I spoke here 3 years ago Israel stood alone among the nations. Of the nearly 200 countries that sit in this hall, only Israel openly opposed the nuclear deal with Iran. We oppose it because it threatens our future, even our very survival,” the prime minister said. “We opposed it because the deal paved Iran’s path to a nuclear arsenal and the lifting of the sanction has fueled Iran’s campaign of carnage and conquest throughout the Middle East. We opposed it because the deal was based on a fundamental lie … Israel exposed that lie.” Continuing what has become a traditional characteristic of presenting visuals during his UN speeches, Netanyahu said “Let me show you exactly what the secret atomic warehouse looks like. Here it is,” while holding up a picture of satellite and up-close images. According to Netanyahu, the second secret site was right near a rug-cleaning store, which he quipped may now be radioactive. There was no immediate official response from Tehran. Iran's mission to the UN did not respond to a request for comment. Iran's state-run, English-language Press TV channel carried Netanyahu's remarks live, but cut away after he made the allegation about the nuclear warehouse.

Just last month they cleared out 15kg of radioactive material … They took it out and they spread it around Tehran in order to hide the evidence," he claimed. He also said Israel shared the information with the UN atomic watchdog, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment. "The IAEA has not demanded to inspect a single site discovered in that secret archive. So given this inaction, I decided to reveal today something else that we have shared with the IAEA and a few intelligence agencies," he explained. Listing a legion of threats posed by Iran and its Lebanon-based terror proxy group Hezbollah, which he said was acquiring the technical know-how from Tehran to convert non-precision missiles into precision missiles to hit Israeli cities, Netanyahu said that he had a message for “the tyrants of Tehran.” “Israel knows what you're doing and Israel knows where you are doing it,” he declared. "What Iran hides, Israel will find.’ Netanyahu said that over the last year, Hezbollah has attempted to build an infrastructure for the conversion of surface-to-surface missiles into precision missiles near an airport in Beirut. In a similar vein to his message to Iran, Netanyahu issued a warning to Hezbollah. "I have a message for Hezbollah today: Israel also knows what you’re doing. Israel knows where you are doing it and Israel will not let you get away with it." PM shows satellite images of precision missiles facility (Photo: AFP) The prime minister’s speech comes on the heels of a diplomatic spat with Russia after Syria accidentally shot down a Russian spy plane while attempting to repel an IAF strike in Latakia. Since the incident last week, Israel has said that it will not be inhibited by the adverse political fallout from continuing to attack targets to prevent Iranian military entrenchment in Syria or the transfer of advanced weapons to Hezbollah—a message that Netanyahu used the podium to reiterate. “Israel will do whatever it must do to defend itself against Iran’s aggression. We will continue to act against you in Syria, we will act against you in Lebanon and we will continue to act against you in Iraq ... wherever, whenever, to defend our state and to defend out people,” he vowed. Accusing Iran of using money that poured into its coffers following the lifting of economic sanctions in the wake of the nuclear deal, Netanyahu said that Tehran “used the money to fuel its vast war machine.” PM Netanyahu at UNGA (Photo: AFP) But Iran’s aggression, the prime minister said, was not confined to the Middle East, asserting that it had spread both into New York and Europe. Despite the threats posed by Iran to the European continent, Netanyahu said that its nations were still “appeasing” and "coddling" the Islamic republic by seeking to mitigate the financial impact of US sanctions. "I’m an historian’s son, I have to ask. I ask not merely as an historian’s son, I ask it as a Jew, as a citizen of the world, as someone who’s lived through the 20th century: Have these European leaders learned nothing from history? Will they ever wake up?" he asked. “Well, in Israel, we don’t need a wakeup call because Iran threatens us every day. Because despite the best of hope, and there were many hopes around the nuclear deal, this deal did not push war further away. It brought war ever closer to our borders,” Netanyahu said. But Netanyahu did say that the Iran nuclear deal had made one significant, positive contribution to the MIddle East. “I have an important confession to make. This may surprise you. But I have to admit that the Iran deal has had one positive consequence … By empowering Iran, it brought Israel and many Arab states closer together than ever before, in an intimacy and friendship that I’ve not seen in my lifetime and that would have been unimaginable years ago,” he said while pounding the rostrum. Netanyahu also used the end of his speech to criticize the people who have objected to Israel’s recent passage of the Nation-State Law, which Abbas said would lead to an official apartheid system. "Israel is called racist for making Hebrew the official language? … When Israel is declared an apartheid state for declaring itself the nation-state of the Jewish people, it is downright preposterous," he shouted.

News article:
Iran has maintained a “secret atomic warehouse” in its capital containing stockpiles of “radioactive material” and other equipment related to its nuclear weapons program, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told world leaders Thursday. “This site contained as much as 300 tons of nuclear related equipment and material,” Netanyahu said at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Netanyahu buttressed the charge with a photograph and coordinates of the “innocent-looking compound,” and predicted that satellite imagery would show a flurry of activity at the site in the coming days. Netanyahu contends that since the beginning of the debate over the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, Tehran would enjoy the economic benefits of the pact without losing its long-term ability develop a nuclear weapon. And he rebuked European leaders who have tried to preserve the nuclear deal despite Iran’s aggression. “Yet while the United States is confronting Iran with new sanctions, Europe and others are appeasing Iran by trying to help it bypass those new sanctions,” he said. “Think about this: the same week Iran was caught red-handed trying to murder European citizens, European leaders were rolling out the red carpet for President Rouhani, promising to give Iran even more money.” International monitors have certified that Iran is in technical compliance with the agreement, but Netanyahu has complained that the International Atomic Energy Agency has refused to try to inspect the most controversial sites. He said Iranian officials have been clearing the site ever since Israeli spies carried out a high-profile raid on another warehouse that held documents chronicling the history of the Iranian program. “Do the right thing,” he said in a message directed at the IAEA. “Go inspect this atomic warehouse, immediately, before the Iranians finish clearing it out.” The Iranian people, some of whom have participated in protests over the country’s economic crisis, were also a clear audience of Netanyahu’s speech, particularly when he said that the regime “removed 15 kilograms of radioactive material” from the warehouse. “You know what they did with it?” he asked rhetorically. “They took it out and they spread it around Tehran in an effort to hide the evidence. The endangered residents of Tehran may want to know that they can get a Gieger counter on Amazon for only $29.99. As of today, that's just 4 million Iranian rials.” His speech offered an argument in favor of President Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the deal and renew economic sanctions on Iran. But European allies oppose that move, believing that the deal defused a nuclear race in the Middle East at a time when world powers can ill-afford another crisis, and they announced a plan Monday to help Iran defy U.S. sanctions. “EU member states will set up a legal entity to facilitate legitimate financial transactions with Iran and this will allow European companies to continue to trade with Iran in accordance with European Union law and could be open to other partners in the world," Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s top diplomat, said after a meeting at the UNGA. U.S. officials don’t think that plan will work, because the companies that the EU hopes will invest in Iran won’t want to risk provoking American sanctions. “Companies have a choice either to do business in Iran or in the United States,” Brian Hook, the special representative for Iran, told reporters Wednesday night. “Very few companies are going to choose Iran over the United States, and so that’s just the economic reality.” In any case, Netanyahu offered the new allegations as a show of force for Israeli intelligence and defense officials. “What Iran hides, Israel will find,” he said. “Israel will never let a regime that calls for our destruction to develop nuclear weapons — not now, not in 10 years, not ever.”

News article:
In a forty-minute speech addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed the presence of another undeclared Iranian nuclear site, and blasted Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas for hypocrisy, The Times of Israel reported Thursday. At the beginning of his speech, Netanyahu revealed that Iran had a second nuclear facility hidden in Iran, near the archive from which Israeli commandoes recovered a half ton of nuclear documentation in January. The new facility, according to Netanyahu, is used for “storing massive amounts of equipment and material from Iran’s secret weapons program.” He predicted that in the coming days, any nation with satellites will be able to detect Iranian officials moving material out of the warehouse. Netanyahu charged that Iran has already moved 15 kilograms (33 pounds) of radioactive material out of the warehouse and placing it around Tehran, putting the city’s residents at risk. The reason Iran still had those facilities even after the 2015 nuclear deal “is because it is not finished with them.” Netanyahu called on International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head, Yukiya Amano, whom he characterized as “a good man,” to “go and inspect this atomic warehouse immediately,” before Iran has a chance to clean the site of all nuclear evidence. The IAEA, Netanyahu said, had not followed up on the documents that Israel recovered from Iran and demanded access to nuclear sites for inspections. The Israeli Prime Minister also accused European leaders of appeasement regarding Iran. “The same week Iran was caught red-handed for trying to murder European citizens,” Netanyahu recalled, “European leaders were laying out the red carpet for President Rouhani, pledging to give them more money.” He urged European leaders to join with the United States, Israel, and the Arab world in supporting stronger sanctions against Iran. Netanyahu said that Israel would not tolerate Iran’s establishment of permanent military bases in Syria, and warned Iran’s proxy, Hezbollah, that “Israel knows where you are doing it, and Israel will not let you get away with it.” As a result of the Iranian threat, Netanyahu noted, Israel has experienced, “intimacy and friendship that I have not seen in my lifetime” with its Arab neighbors. “Israel,” he said, “deeply values these new friendships, and I hope the day will soon arrive when Israel will extend a formal peace, beyond Egypt and Jordan, to other Arab nations, including the Palestinians.” However, he reserved sharp words for Abbas, who had spoken earlier in the day. While Abbas had claimed that the PA “resisted” Israel by “only peaceful means. We never use violence,” Netanyahu charged that the PA was, in fact, promoting terror. “They more they slay, the more you pay. and you condemn Israel’s morality? You call Israel racist? This is not the way to peace,” the prime minister said. He also chided the UN, who applauded Abbas, saying that, instead, they “should condemn such a despicable policy.” In the end, Netanyahu praised the United States, especially President Donald Trump and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley “for the support they provide to Israel at the United Nations.” [Photo: IsraeliPM / YouTube ]

News article:
A US intelligence official said claims by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that a secret warehouse in Tehran contained nuclear “equipment and material” were “somewhat misleading,” Reuters reported Friday.

News article:
UNITED NATIONS: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described on Thursday what he said was a secret atomic warehouse in Tehran and accused Europe of appeasing Iran as he sought to rally support for US sanctions against the Islamic Republic. Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Netanyahu showed an aerial photograph of the Iranian capital marked with a red arrow and pointed to what he said was a previously secret warehouse holding nuclear-related material. He argued this showed Iran still sought to obtain nuclear weapons, despite its 2015 agreement with world powers to curb its program in exchange for loosening of sanctions. Netanyahu spoke 4-1/2 months after US President Donald Trump withdrew from the accord, arguing it did too little to rein in Tehran´s nuclear ambitions and triggering the resumption of US economic sanctions on Iran. Netanyahu said the site contained some 15 kilograms (33 pounds) of radioactive material that has since been moved and called on the UN atomic agency to inspect the location immediately with Geiger counters. "I am disclosing for the first time that Iran has another secret facility in Tehran, a secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and materiel from Iran´s secret nuclear programme," Netanyahu said. The world will laugh at Netanyahu´s claims, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said, according to Fars News. "The world will only laugh loudly at this type of false, meaningless and unnecessary speech and false shows," Qassemi said. Iran´s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that there should be more scrutiny on Israel´s nuclear program. "No arts & craft show will ever obfuscate that Israel is only regime in our region with a secret and undeclared nuclear weapons program - including an actual atomic arsenal. Time for Israel to fess up and open its illegal nuclear weapons program to international inspectors," Zarif tweeted. Netanyahu did not identify the material nor specifically suggest that Iran had actively violated the nuclear deal. An outspoken opponent of the deal, Netanyahu has previously made allegations about Iran´s nuclear activities that are difficult or impossible to verify, including presenting a cartoon bomb to the General Assembly in 2012 warning of how close Tehran was to producing a nuclear device. In April, Netanyahu presented what he said was evidence of a large secret archive of documents related to Iran´s clandestine nuclear weapons program at a different site in Tehran. He said Israeli agents removed vast amounts of documents from that site. At the time, Iran said the documents were fake. In a speech in which he said relatively little about efforts to achieve peace with the Palestinians, Netanyahu said Iran had since begun moving items out of the second site. "Since we raided the atomic archive, they´ve been busy cleaning out the atomic warehouse. Just last month they removed 15 kilograms of radioactive material. You know what they did with it?" he said. "They took it out and they spread it around Tehran in an effort to hide the evidence. "He said Iranian officials still had a lot of work to do because there were some 15 shipping containers full of nuclear-related equipment and materials stored at the second site. "This site contained as much as 300 tonnes - 300 tonnes - of nuclear-related equipment and materiel," he said. Under the nuclear deal struck by Iran and six major powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear program in return for relief from US and other economic sanctions. The International Atomic Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly said Tehran was abiding by its commitments to the deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), including in a document reviewed by Reuters on Aug. 30.France, Britain, Germany, China and Russia have stayed in the pact, vowing to save it despite the restoration of US sanctions and this week discussing a barter mechanism they hope may allow Iran to circumvent the US measures.Netanyahu criticized Europe for doing so in unusually harsh language that evoked European nations´ initial failure to confront Nazi Germany in the 1930s. "While the United States is confronting Iran with new sanctions, Europe and others are appeasing Iran by trying to help it bypass those new sanctions," Netanyahu said. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States is aware of the facility Netanyahu announced and described it as a "warehouse" used to store "records andarchives" from Iran's nuclear program. A second US intelligence official called Netanyahuâ€™s comments "somewhat misleading. First, we have known about this facility for some time, and itâ€™s full of file cabinets and paper, not aluminium tubes for centrifuges, and second, so far as anyone knows, there is nothing in it that would allow Iran to break out of the JCPOA any faster than it otherwise could. "The Israeli leader also lambasted Iran´s ballistic missile activity, identifying three locations near Beirut airport where he said Lebanon´s Hezbollah was converting missiles. "In Lebanon, Iran is directing Hezbollah to build secret sites to convert inaccurate projectiles into precision-guided missiles, missiles that can target deep inside Israel within an accuracy of 10 metres (yards)," he said. The IAEA, Iran and Hezbollah were not immediately available for comment. The Israeli military released a video clip and photos of what it said were Hezbollah Shi´ite militia rocket building sites in Lebanon, shortly after Netanyahu´s address.

By JTA September 28, 2018 (JTA) — A State Department official called on the International Atomic Energy Agency to investigate Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s claims about a secret nuclear warehouse in Tehran. Netanyahu made the claim about the facility in the Turquzabad district of the Iranian capital Thursday during a speech at the U.N. headquarters in New York. Netanyahu claimed the warehouse was used for “storing massive amounts of equipment and material from Iran’s secret weapons program,” which was being moved to other parts of the city. He urged the IAEA to investigate the locale.

Iran has denied Netanyahu’s claims about a nuclear warehouse.

By JTA September 28, 2018 (JTA) — A State Department official called on the International Atomic Energy Agency to investigate Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s claims about a secret nuclear warehouse in Tehran. Netanyahu made the claim about the facility in the Turquzabad district of the Iranian capital Thursday during a speech at the U.N. headquarters in New York. Netanyahu claimed the warehouse was used for “storing massive amounts of equipment and material from Iran’s secret weapons program,” which was being moved to other parts of the city. He urged the IAEA to investigate the locale. In a statement quoted by Reuters, a State Department official said following Netanyahu’s claims that it was “absolutely imperative that the IAEA fully exercise its authorities in order to provide confidence to the international community that there are no undeclared nuclear materials or activities in Iran.” An unnamed U.S. diplomatic source quoted by the Israel Broadcasting Corp. said: “The latest revelation of nuclear documents requires the Agency to find out if Iran is hiding nuclear materials or activity.” In April, Israel announced it had stolen more than 100,000 documents from a Tehran archive detailing the Iranian nuclear program.

News article:
By Reuters September 28, 2018 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described on Thursday what he said was a secret atomic warehouse in Tehran and accused Europe of appeasing Iran as he sought to rally support for U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic. Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Netanyahu showed an aerial photograph of the Iranian capital marked with a red arrow and pointed to what he said was a previously secret warehouse holding nuclear-related material. He argued this showed Iran still sought to obtain nuclear weapons, despite its 2015 agreement with world powers to curb its program in exchange for loosening of sanctions. Netanyahu spoke 4-1/2 months after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the accord, arguing it did too little to rein in Tehran’s nuclear ambitions and triggering the resumption of U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. Netanyahu said the site contained some 15 kilograms (33 pounds) of radioactive material that has since been moved and called on the U.N. atomic agency to inspect the location immediately with Geiger counters. “I am disclosing for the first time that Iran has another secret facility in Tehran, a secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and materiel from Iran’s secret nuclear program,” Netanyahu said. Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that there should be more scrutiny on Israel’s nuclear program. “No arts & craft show will ever obfuscate that Israel is only regime in our region with a secret and undeclared nuclear weapons program – including an actual atomic arsenal. Time for Israel to fess up and open its illegal nuclear weapons program to international inspectors,” Zarif tweeted.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Friday dismissed Israeli claims that Tehran was harbouring a secret atomic warehouse. "No arts & craft show will ever obfuscate that Israel is only regime in our region with a *secret* and *undeclared* nuclear weapons programme," Zarif said in a tweet. He called on Israel saying it was "time to fess up and open its illegal nuclear weapons" programme to international inspectors. "How can Israel, as the only holder of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, so shamelessly accuse a country whose programmes have repeatedly been declared as peaceful by the IAEA," the UN nuclear watchdog, Iran's official IRNA news agency quoted Zarif as saying. He said Israel and the United States stood "alone" on the world stage, as "policies forced by Netanyahu on America" had driven them both to isolation. Zarif was responding to allegations made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday in a speech to the UN General Assembly, embellished by ample use of the colourful props that have become his trademark. Netanyahu held up a map and a photograph of an outwardly "innocent looking compound" which he said was a secret atomic warehouse in Tehran and urged the IAEA to inspect. "Today, I'm disclosing for the first time that Iran has another secret facility in Tehran, a secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and materiel from Iran's secret nuclear weapons programme," he said. Israel, along with Saudi Arabia and its allies, are the main supporters of US President Donald Trump's abandonment of a landmark 2015 nuclear accord between the major powers and Iran. The move, announced in May and accompanied by the subsequent reimposition of crippling US sanctions, has put Washington at odds with other major powers, including longstanding allies.

News article:
NEW YORK — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s revelation at the UN on Thursday of a previously unknown Iranian nuclear site has caused “growing pressure inside Iran,” a senior Israeli official said over the weekend. “They’re wondering how to deal with this facility, how to evacuate it, how to cover it up,” the official said. “There is no doubt it is a very important site for them; they’re seeking to conceal it and stall in any way possible.” According to the official, the 15 kilograms of radioactive material that Netanyahu said was removed from the facility and dispersed around Tehran was taken away at the beginning of August. Netanyahu, meanwhile, told Israeli reporters in a briefing Friday that it was past time for the IAEA to act, and that Iran had been exposed “as deceiving and cheating the international community.” He also said that Iran was aiming to break out to a nuclear arsenal when it deems the time ripe: “There’ll be a crisis somewhere or other, and they’ll [take advantage of the distraction] to break out to a nuclear arsenal,” he warned. “That’s the Iranian plan.” In his address to the UN General Assembly on Thursday, revealing the “secret atomic warehouse,” Netanyahu said “[Global] intelligence services and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have known about this for six weeks” and failed to act. The warehouse allegedly contained nuclear materials that Iran is not allowed to hold without declaring them to the IAEA. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Netanyahu, in his speech, claimed the warehouse was used for “storing massive amounts of equipment and material from Iran’s secret weapons program,” which was quickly being moved to other parts of the city. The site may contain as much as 300 tons of nuclear-related equipment and material in 15 shipping containers, he added. The US on Friday asked the IAEA to investigate Netanyahu’s new allegations, although Reuters also quoted a US official as saying the prime minister’s information was misleading, and that the site contained documentation and not nuclear materials. Advertisement The Israeli official rejected this on Friday, saying “It’s not just documents. There are other things there,” and added: “Did he check it? First of all, let them check.” He noted that it seemed “very important for Iran to hide it, to disperse things across Tehran.” The official acknowledged that Israel did not have information on everything contained within the site, and said this was why the IAEA should “go and check.” Asked if the existence of the secret warehouse and its contents definitely violated the terms of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the Israeli official replied: “First of all, let them check… Why did they remove 15 kilograms of radioactive material? That’s a question that needs to be looked into. “We know there’s radioactive material there. They distributed that radioactive material all around Tehran. Those 15 kilograms are a fact. Why did they go around dispersing it? What happened? They need to check.” Iranians on Friday published selfies on social media taken outside the facility, and mocked Netanyahu’s claim that it was a secret nuclear facility. The official said “The fact that you have young Iranians taking selfies there is unbelievable.” The senior official scoffed at the notion that Netanyahu had exposed sensitive intelligence material. “That’s absurd. We had discussions about this, what to reveal and what not to, and it was decided to reveal it at this point.” Advertisement Briefing Israeli reporters traveling with him in the US, Netanyahu himself on Friday said it was “time for [the IAEA] to act.” As to whether it would, he said: “They may act and they may not act, but one thing is certain — Iran has been exposed as deceiving and cheating the international community. That’s been revealed and that’s the main purpose. Anything else is a bonus.” Netanyahu once again lambasted the 2015 nuclear deal, saying Iran “immediately” used funds freed up by the accord to bolster its war machine. “It gave them hundreds of millions of dollars in direct released funds, in credit and in the entry of investors” and Iran had since seen “a 40 percent increase in its defense budget.” Said Netanyahu Friday, in a bitter denunciation of the accord: “The essence of the 2015 nuclear deal was that, in that in return for not enriching uranium for a single bomb, Iran in a few years will get the right to enrich for hundreds of bombs. Iran has already announced that it will produce 200,000 centrifuges, some of them 20 times faster than the current generation.” Iran, he said, has “mountains of yellowcake” uranium concentrate. “They have their archived information [on bomb-making] in their secret atomic archive. They can push not for one bomb, but for hundreds of bombs simultaneously.” “There’ll be a crisis somewhere or other, and they’ll [take advantage of the distraction] to break out to a nuclear arsenal,” he warned. “That’s the Iranian plan. And that’s what the agreement gave them. “It also gave them hundreds of millions of dollars — directly released funds,” he noted. “They put that money directly into their war machine; there’s been a 40% increase in their defense budget. The Iranians, he said, “were also obligated [under the deal] to come clean on all their [nuclear] activities. The 15 kilograms [of radioactive material] is further prove [of their failure to do so].” The newly revealed warehouse, said Netanyahu, did not merely contain documents, as some US officials have charged. “There are other things too. But they key fact is that they hid it.” Advertisement On Friday an unnamed official told Channel 10 news that the facility was uncovered by the Mossad spy agency a few months ago, and had since been kept under surveillance. When the IAEA failed to act, the Israeli government apparently agonized over what to do with the information, and decided after discussions in the Prime Minister’s Office that Netanyahu would reveal it in his annual speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday in an attempt to goad the IAEA into taking action. “There was no choice but to reveal this information, because the goal is to prompt the IAEA to take action,” the senior official said. “We wanted to wake up the world and pressure the IAEA to act against the suspected facilities in Iran.” Channel 10 reported that the senior official revealed that the nuclear facility is under the supervision of a secret Iranian defense ministry department headed by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, named by Netanyahu in his April presentation of the seized nuclear archive as the Iranian physicist who heads the country’s nuclear program. “Remember that name, Fakhrizadeh,” Netanyahu had said in April, showcasing the material that he said proved conclusively that Iran lied when it said it had not sought nuclear weapons and that the 2015 nuclear deal was built upon “Iranian deception.” The Israeli official was adamant, by contrast, that what the Iranians were keeping in the newly revealed warehouse was considerably more grave than the contents of the archive. The official did not elaborate beyond saying it was “forbidden nuclear material,” the TV report said. In May an Israeli TV report suggested Jerusalem may have decided not to assassinate Fakhrizadeh because it prefers to keep him alive and watch what he is up to, even as other Iranian nuclear experts have been assassinated in recent years in hits attributed to the Mossad. Advertisement At the General Assembly speech (full text here), the prime minister said the IAEA had failed to take any action after he revealed in April a nuclear archive that Israeli spies managed to spirit out of Iran, and so he was now revealing what he said was a “secret atomic warehouse” in the Turquzabad district of Tehran, a few miles from the archive. Both the archive and warehouse, Netanyahu said, were proof that Iran had not given up its nuclear program. “Iran has not abandoned its goal to develop nuclear weapons…. Rest assured that will not happen. What Iran hides, Israel will find,” Netanyahu added. On Thursday, Netanyahu also met with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and urged him to ask the IAEA to investigate the facility. He urged IAEA director-general Yukiya Amano, who he called “a good man,” to “do the right thing” and “go and inspect this atomic warehouse immediately — before the Iranians finish cleaning it out.” Inspect “right here, right now,” he urged, “and inspect the other sites we told you about… Tell the world the truth about Iran.” Iranian officials have dismissed Netanyahu’s claims about the atomic warehouse as unfounded and “obscene.” Referring to Netanyahu’s statements as “ridiculous,” an Iranian state TV report said the country is committed to nonproliferation and Iran’s nuclear program is under surveillance of the IAEA. The website of state TV briefly reported the Netanyahu accusation and called it an “illusion.” Agencies contributed to this report.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu intended to reveal a third batch of intelligence material in his UN speech on Thursday, in which he exposed what he said was a “secret atomic warehouse” in Tehran and revealed details of Hezbollah missile factories in Beirut, a senior Israeli official said at the weekend. Netanyahu ultimately elected not to include the third revelation in his address to the General Assembly because the security establishment recommended that he not do so, Israel’s Channel 10 news said Saturday night. Beyond indicating that the intelligence material related to “a third site,” the official provided no further details of the information. Netanyahu’s decision to specify the location and alleged content of the Tehran atomic warehouse, from which he said the Iranians recently removed 15 kilograms of radioactive material, was taken after consultations with the security establishment and with its approval, the prime minister has made clear. Israel had provided details of the warehouse to the IAEA and to the US administration six weeks ago, but Netanyahu charged that the IAEA failed to act. It was decided after security consultations at the Prime Minister’s Office that Netanyahu would publicize the information at the UN, in the hope of galvanizing the IAEA into action. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Since his speech, the US has indeed asked the IAEA to investigate the site, and Netanyahu also asked UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to push the IAEA on this. Immediately after Netanyahu’s speech, meanwhile, the IDF published further information on the Hezbollah missile factories that Netanyahu had referred to. Presumably the recommendation from security chiefs that Netanyahu not include material on the third site in his speech stemmed from a decision to work behind the scenes on this issue for the time being. Advertisement In April, Netanyahu held a press conference to detail the contents of a huge haul of documentation taken by the Mossad from a secret Iranian nuclear weapons project archive in Tehran. The operation to remove that material from under the Iranians’ noses had taken place months earlier. Israel had privately shared some of the material with the US and with the IAEA, Netanyahu said at the time, but did not rush to make the haul public. Briefing Israeli reporters traveling with Netanyahu in the US on Friday, a senior Israeli official said the prime minister’s revelation of the atomic warehouse and its contents has caused “growing pressure inside Iran.” “They’re wondering how to deal with this facility, how to evacuate it, how to cover it up,” the official said. “There is no doubt it is a very important site for them; they’re seeking to conceal it and stall in any way possible.” According to the official, the 15 kilograms of radioactive material that Netanyahu said was removed from the facility and dispersed around Tehran was taken away at the beginning of August. Netanyahu himself told Israeli reporters at the briefing that it was past time for the IAEA to act, and that Iran had been exposed “as deceiving and cheating the international community.” He also said that Iran was aiming to break out to a nuclear arsenal when it deems the time ripe: “There’ll be a crisis somewhere or other, and they’ll [take advantage of the distraction] to break out to a nuclear arsenal,” he warned. “That’s the Iranian plan.” In his address to the General Assembly on Thursday revealing the “secret atomic warehouse,” Netanyahu said “[Global] intelligence services and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have known about this for six weeks” and failed to act. The warehouse allegedly contained nuclear materials that Iran is not allowed to hold without declaring them to the IAEA. Advertisement Netanyahu, in his speech, claimed the warehouse was used for “storing massive amounts of equipment and material from Iran’s secret weapons program,” which was quickly being moved to other parts of the city. The site may contain as much as 300 tons of nuclear-related equipment and material in 15 shipping containers, he added. The US on Friday asked the IAEA to investigate Netanyahu’s new allegations, although Reuters also quoted a US official as saying the prime minister’s information was misleading, and that the site contained documentation and not nuclear materials. The Israeli official rejected this on Friday, saying, “It’s not just documents. There are other things there,” and added: “Did he check it? First of all, let them check.” He noted that it seemed “very important for Iran to hide it, to disperse things across Tehran.” The official acknowledged that Israel did not have information on everything contained within the site, and said this was why the IAEA should “go and check.” Asked if the existence of the secret warehouse and its contents definitely violated the terms of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the Israeli official replied: “First of all, let them check… Why did they remove 15 kilograms of radioactive material? That’s a question that needs to be looked into. “We know there’s radioactive material there. They distributed that radioactive material all around Tehran. Those 15 kilograms are a fact. Why did they go around dispersing it? What happened? They need to check.” Advertisement Iranians on Friday published selfies on social media taken outside the facility, and mocked Netanyahu’s claim that it was a secret nuclear facility. The official said, “The fact that you have young Iranians taking selfies there is unbelievable.” The senior official scoffed at the notion that Netanyahu had exposed sensitive intelligence material. “That’s absurd. We had discussions about this, what to reveal and what not to, and it was decided to reveal it at this point.” Netanyahu himself on Friday said it was “time for [the IAEA] to act.” As to whether it would, he said: “They may act and they may not act, but one thing is certain — Iran has been exposed as deceiving and cheating the international community. That’s been revealed and that’s the main purpose. Anything else is a bonus.” Netanyahu once again lambasted the 2015 nuclear deal, saying Iran “immediately” used funds freed up by the accord to bolster its war machine. “It gave them hundreds of millions of dollars in direct released funds, in credit and in the entry of investors” and Iran had since seen “a 40 percent increase in its defense budget.” Said Netanyahu Friday, in a bitter denunciation of the accord: “The essence of the 2015 nuclear deal was that, in that in return for not enriching uranium for a single bomb, Iran in a few years will get the right to enrich for hundreds of bombs. Iran has already announced that it will produce 200,000 centrifuges, some of them 20 times faster than the current generation.” Iran, he said, has “mountains of yellowcake” uranium concentrate. “They have their archived information [on bomb-making] in their secret atomic archive. They can push not for one bomb, but for hundreds of bombs simultaneously.” “There’ll be a crisis somewhere or other, and they’ll [take advantage of the distraction] to break out to a nuclear arsenal,” he warned. “That’s the Iranian plan. And that’s what the agreement gave them. Advertisement “It also gave them hundreds of millions of dollars — directly released funds,” he noted. “They put that money directly into their war machine; there’s been a 40% increase in their defense budget. The Iranians, he said, “were also obligated [under the deal] to come clean on all their [nuclear] activities. The 15 kilograms [of radioactive material] is further prove [of their failure to do so].” The newly revealed warehouse, said Netanyahu, did not merely contain documents, as some US officials have charged. “There are other things too. But they key fact is that they hid it.” On Friday an unnamed official told Channel 10 news that the facility was uncovered by the Mossad spy agency a few months ago, and had since been kept under surveillance. When the IAEA failed to act, the Israeli government apparently agonized over what to do with the information, and decided after discussions in the Prime Minister’s Office that Netanyahu would reveal it in his annual speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday in an attempt to goad the IAEA into taking action. “There was no choice but to reveal this information, because the goal is to prompt the IAEA to take action,” the senior official said. “We wanted to wake up the world and pressure the IAEA to act against the suspected facilities in Iran.” Channel 10 reported that the senior official revealed that the nuclear facility is under the supervision of a secret Iranian defense ministry department headed by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, named by Netanyahu in his April presentation of the seized nuclear archive as the Iranian physicist who heads the country’s nuclear program. “Remember that name, Fakhrizadeh,” Netanyahu had said in April, showcasing the material that he said proved conclusively that Iran lied when it said it had not sought nuclear weapons and that the 2015 nuclear deal was built upon “Iranian deception.” The Israeli official was adamant, by contrast, that what the Iranians were keeping in the newly revealed warehouse was considerably more grave than the contents of the archive. The official did not elaborate beyond saying it was “forbidden nuclear material,” the TV report said. In May an Israeli TV report suggested Jerusalem may have decided not to assassinate Fakhrizadeh because it prefers to keep him alive and watch what he is up to, even as other Iranian nuclear experts have been assassinated in recent years in hits attributed to the Mossad. At the General Assembly speech (full text here), the prime minister said the IAEA had failed to take any action after he revealed in April a nuclear archive that Israeli spies managed to spirit out of Iran, and so he was now revealing what he said was a “secret atomic warehouse” in the Turquzabad district of Tehran, a few miles from the archive. Both the archive and warehouse, Netanyahu said, were proof that Iran had not given up its nuclear program. “Iran has not abandoned its goal to develop nuclear weapons … Rest assured that will not happen. What Iran hides, Israel will find,” Netanyahu added. On Thursday, Netanyahu also met with UN Secretary-General Guterres and urged him to ask the IAEA to investigate the facility. He urged IAEA director-general Yukiya Amano, whom he called “a good man,” to “do the right thing” and “go and inspect this atomic warehouse immediately — before the Iranians finish cleaning it out.” Inspect “right here, right now,” he urged, “and inspect the other sites we told you about… Tell the world the truth about Iran.” Iranian officials have dismissed Netanyahu’s claims about the atomic warehouse as unfounded and “obscene.” Referring to Netanyahu’s statements as “ridiculous,” an Iranian state TV report said the country is committed to nonproliferation and Iran’s nuclear program is under surveillance of the IAEA. The website of state TV briefly reported the Netanyahu accusation and called it an “illusion.” Agencies contributed to this report.

News article:
Israel in no position to level nuclear accusation at Iran: Zarif Iran Press TV Fri Sep 28, 2018 01:41AM Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has lashed out at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his baseless claims against Iran at his UN speech, saying Tel Aviv is in no position to level such accusations against Tehran. "Netanyahu must explain how Israel, as the only possessor of nuclear weapons in the Middle East region, can put itself in a position to level such brazen accusations against a country whose [nuclear] program has been repeatedly declared peaceful by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)," Zarif told IRNA on Thursday. The senior Iranian diplomat's comments came after the Israeli prime minister once again took the stage at the UN on Thursday to put on another spectacle about Iran's nuclear program, repeating his threadbare allegation that the country is working to develop nuclear weapons at "secret" sites. Zarif said Netanyahu's move is only aimed at deflecting attention from the fact that the Israeli regime is "the biggest threat to the Middle East" given that he stands by a nuclear weapons facility and threatens other states with atomic annihilation. "The Tel Aviv regime will never manage to achieve anything by playing such games," the Iranian foreign minister added. "We have seen in recent days the extent of the US' isolation at the UN General Assembly and the Security Council as a result of the policies Netanyahu has imposed on Washington. Now imagine how isolated the Israelis themselves are when they have managed to haul the US into such isolation," Zarif stated. 'World to laugh out loud at Netanyahu's Iran claims' Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi strongly dismissed Netanyahu's UN show as "ridiculous" and a fabricated scenario aimed at making up for the failed US and Israeli smear campaign against Iran at the UN General Assembly. "The occupying regime [of Israel] must know that in the new era, the world will only laugh out loud at such false, inconsiderate and empty remarks and fake shows," Qassemi told journalists on Thursday. He referred to the IAEA as the only body responsible for dealing with nuclear issues, saying that 12 reports issued by the UN atomic watchdog and verified by the global community and all relevant parties have so far confirmed Iran's commitment to its obligations under the 2015 nuclear deal, officially known as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

Israel plans to share recently obtained intelligence ‎on covert Iranian nuclear activity, as well as on ‎its efforts to arm its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah, ‎with several countries worldwide in an effort to ‎drive them to act against the Islamic republic.‎ Addressing the U.N.

Iranian spokesman slams Netanyahu’s ‘Ridiculous Behavior’ at UN Tasnim – Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi rejected Israeli Prime Minister’s recent speech at the United Nations General Assembly about a “secret nuclear warehouse” in Tehran and said his claims are “more like a joke”. Speaking to reporters at his weekly press briefing in Tehran on Monday, Qassemi said what has been done by the Zionist regime of Israel against Iran is nothing but hostility and obstructionism, which has led to nothing but failure for the Israeli premier. His behavior is more like a joke, the spokesman said, adding that this is while many countries are deeply concerned about the Tel Aviv regime’s nuclear weapons program. In response to a question about Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s remarks about mediation between Iran and Israel, Qassemi said the Islamic Republic’s stance on the Zionist regime is completely clear, indicating that Iran would not accept such a mediation because it does not recognize the Zionist entity. In a speech to the UN General Assembly on Thursday, Netanyahu said he was revealing the existence of the “atomic warehouse” for the first time in public. As he has in past presentations, Netanyahu brought visual aids to illustrate his claims, according to media reports. He held up a satellite image which he said showed where the warehouse was located in Tehran, and a photograph of a nondescript wall and metal gate, which he said showed the exterior of the warehouse. Israel is the only possessor of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, but its policy is to neither confirm nor deny that it has atomic bombs. The Tel Aviv regime is estimated to have 200 to 400 nuclear warheads in its arsenal. Unlike Iran, the Tel Aviv regime is not a member of the NPT — whose aim is to prevent the spread of nuclear arms and weapons technology – in defiance of international pressure.

News article:
JNS.org – For a moment, it seemed that the Israeli-Palestinian ‎conflict would dominate the UN General Assembly, as ‎well as the international agenda for the coming ‎year. But then came the addresses of Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which sought ‎to focus world leaders’ attention on the Iranian ‎issue. ‎ Trump made it clear that his administration plans to ‎focus on Iran (just as he promised to focus on North Korea last year). ‎Meeting with Netanyahu on the sidelines of the UN ‎General Assembly, Trump surprised many by officially ‎endorsing the two-state solution — then by ‎qualifying that, and saying that he’ll support whatever the parties agree to. He also announced that the ‎administration plans to roll out the much-‎anticipated “deal of the century” within a few ‎months. ‎ Trump may still strive to pitch a deal ‎meant to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but chances of that are slim, for several ‎reasons. ‎ First, in reality, we are no longer dealing with a ‎two-state solution, but rather with a three-state ‎solution — namely, Israel, a Palestinian state in the ‎West Bank, and a Hamas state in the Gaza Strip. Hamas is not going anywhere, and it is doubtful that its ‎leaders would agree to reconcile with the Fatah-led ‎Palestinian Authority just to facilitate Trump’s ‎‎“deal of the century.” Second, despite rhetoric to the contrary, Arab ‎leaders have no real intention of going over ‎the head of Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas ‎and accepting a deal on the Palestinians’ behalf. ‎This leads to the third reason: The Palestinian ‎leadership simply cannot make the necessary historic ‎decisions for peace. Related coverage Palestinian Children Wear Necklaces with Pictures of Their Dead Terrorist ‘Role Models’ The latest trend in the Palestinian Authority (PA) is a new kind of jewelry: Necklace-amulets with pictures of terrorist “Martyrs”... Abbas can protest that “Jerusalem is not ‎for sale” as much as he wants, but the bottom line ‎is that Trump is right — there is no reason why the ‎United States should give the Palestinian Authority hundreds ‎of millions of dollars in aid only to be ‎disrespected on the world stage — at least as much ‎as Abbas respects Russian President Vladimir Putin, ‎who has never given the Palestinians a dime. The problems with an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal are why Trump and Netanyahu both chose to focus ‎on Iran at the UN General Assembly. ‎ Netanyahu’s speech again showcased Israel’s ‎intelligence and operational prowess, which time and ‎again highlighted Iran and Hezbollah’s malicious activities. Trump’s speech reiterated the US pledge to ‎prevent Iran from going nuclear, and to stop it from ‎disseminating terrorism and chaos in the Persian ‎Gulf and Middle East.‎ Failing to come up with a good answer to the ‎allegations made against Iran at the General ‎Assembly, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad ‎Zarif resorted to familiar rhetoric, saying that ‎the Holocaust did not justify the establishment of the ‎State of Israel on Palestinian land. ‎ Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, for his part, ‎opted for a more “elegant” suggestion, saying, “We ‎do not wish to fight or destroy or throw anyone into ‎the ocean. We call on the Israelis, in the most ‎civilized way possible, to board planes or ships and ‎return to the countries from where they came. ‎Only the Jews who lived in Palestine before [the ‎Balfour Declaration] will be able to stay here. The ‎rest, those who came from all over the world, have ‎to leave.” These statements are another good reason why Iran and ‎its allies must be stopped. European leaders would ‎be wise to pay attention to Tehran’s statements before rushing to appease ‎Iran.‎ Eyal Zisser is a lecturer in the Middle East History Department at Tel Aviv University.

News article:
An official with Iran's Revolutionary Guards has warned Israeli PM Netanyahu to "practice swimming," saying he'll soon have no other choice but to flee the region. It comes as Tehran accuses Israel of spreading Iranophobia. "Netanyahu should know that there is no way for him except fleeing the region and so he needs to learn how to swim in the Mediterranean Sea," Brigadier-General Hossein Salami said during a Friday address to a group of IRGC commanders and officers in the central Iranian city of Isfahan, as quoted by Fars news agency. His comments come after Netanyahu addressed the UN General Assembly (UNGA) a little over a week ago, stating that its arch rival Iran has "another secret facility in Tehran, a secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and material from Iran's secret nuclear program." Netanyahu has intensified his statements that Iran is developing nuclear weapons since the US, Israel's biggest ally, pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. He reiterated at the UNGA meeting that Israel will never let a government that calls for its destruction to develop nuclear weapons. "Not now, not in 10 years, not ever." Iran's foreign ministry responded to those comments by stating that the world "will only laugh loudly at this type of false, meaningless, and unnecessary speech and false shows." Foreign Minister Javad Zarif also took to Twitter to state that Israel is the only country in the region with a "secret" and "undeclared" nuclear weapons program - including an "actual atomic arsenal." No arts & craft show will ever obfuscate that Israel is only regime in our region with a *secret* and *undeclared* nuclear weapons program - including an *actual atomic arsenal*. Time for Israel to fess up and open its illegal nuclear weapons program to international inspectors. — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) September 27, 2018 Tehran does not recognize Israel as a country, and regularly warns that it will soon cease to exist. Syria is another bone of contention between the two countries, with tensions becoming even worse after Israel vowed to prevent Iran from establishing a permanent military presence in Syria and carried out dozens of strikes against Iranian bases. Just days ago, Netanyahu welcomed a historic $38 billion in military aid from Washington, with the US State Department noting that the package is aimed at protecting Israel against "all potential regional adversaries," but foremost from the "Iranian regime’s sponsorship of terrorist groups." Netanyahu took to Twitter to express his gratitude, stating that "Israel and the world face complex security challenges, first and foremost Iranian aggression," while calling Washington's "unwavering support" one of the "pillars of the strong relationship between the two countries." Meanwhile, Iran is also accusing the US of interfering in Middle Eastern affairs, stating that sanctions against Iran are driving the price of crude up - and that if Trump wants cheaper oil like he claims, he should stop meddling.

News article:
© Mohamad Torokman / Reuters Israel's top court has greenlighted the eviction of a West Bank Bedouin village despite earlier international uproar. The Palestinian authorities have slammed the move, calling on the global community to "intervene immediately."The Israeli High Court of Justice rejected an appeal from the residents of Khan Al-Ahmar, a Bedouin village east of Jerusalem, effectively greenlighting its demolition on Wednesday. Israel says the village was built without an Israeli permit, but Palestinians say they are impossible to obtain. Tel Aviv's plan to raze the village, which is home to around 180 people,has been met with an avalanche of international condemnation, including from the UN, high-ranking EU officials, and Amnesty International.However, all this has not deterred Israel from ruling that the village can be bulldozed and the Palestinian government is calling to take action."The International community must come out of its ineffective condemnations shell and intervene immediately to defend its human and legal system, which Israel is explicitly penetrating into," it said in a statement as cited by Wafa news agency.It is unclear where the families of the village are going to move as alternative sites suggested by Israel were rejected. One of them is close to a landfill site belonging to the nearby town of Abu Dis, and the other lies in a desert location south-west of Jericho - which is also inappropriate for "a community that has animals and needs grazing," according to the UN.Amnesty International said that forced transfers amount to war crimes under a statute of the International Criminal Court.

News article:
GENEVA (10 September 2018) – An Israeli High Court ruling giving the Government of Israel the green light to demolish the entire Palestinian Bedouin community of Khan al-Ahmar Ab al Helu, has been described as “appalling” by two UN human rights experts*. “It is gravely disappointing that a High Court can take a decision that is totally against the fundamental principles of international human rights law and international humanitarian law,” said Michael Lynk, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967 and Leilani Farha, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living. “This appalling decision could trigger the eviction of 180 inhabitants, including more than 90 children, putting them at imminent risk of forcible transfer,” they added. “Forced eviction constitutes a gross violation of the right to adequate housing under international human rights law. In addition, forcible transfer of people who are protected within an occupied territory is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention, and amounts to a war crime under the 1998 Rome Statute,” the experts said. “If the demolition of the village goes ahead and results in the residents having to move out of their current location, all those responsible for this international crime should be held accountable.” The experts’ comments follow a decision on 5 September to dismiss the latest petitions by residents of Khan al-Ahmar, some 15 km northeast of Jerusalem in the West Bank. The Special Rapporteurs are also urging Israel, as the occupying power, to stop the eviction. “It is time to regularize their situation and respect the rights of the Khan al-Ahmar residents to remain on the lands they have inhabited for decades,” the experts added. The residents of Khan al-Ahmar are descendants of Bedouins expelled from the Negev by Israel in the 1950s. They were relocated in the West Bank, on the outskirts of Jerusalem. Their village is situated between two large Israeli settlements, Ma’ale Adumim and Kfar Adumim, and an Israeli industrial zone called Mishor Adumim. The residents have been subjected to constant pressure by the Israeli authorities and neighbouring settlers and have been living in what has been described as an “increasingly coercive environment” that may leave no other choice to the community but to move. ENDS (*) The UN experts: Mr. Michael Lynk, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967 and Ms Leilani Farha, Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living.

News article:
Israeli High Court Green Lights Razing of Khan al-Ahmar Anan AbuShanab Research Assistant, Middle East and North Africa Division Residents of Khan al-Ahmar thought they had found a way around Israel’s discriminatory building permit regime in Area C of the West Bank. Since a building permit is required only for concrete structures, they built their school, which serves 160 children from five villages, using clay and 2,200 old tires. The plan didn’t work. The Israeli army has exclusive control over planning in Area C. It has allocated just one percent of that land for Palestinian buildings, and refuses the vast majority of Palestinian permit applications. Khan al-Ahmar was no exception. Over the years, Israeli authorities issued demolition orders against the school and every other structure in this small village of 180 residents, just east of Jerusalem, on the grounds that they lacked permits. On September 5, Israel’s High Court rejected several appeals, and green-lighted demolition. Israeli military planning documents do not recognize the community’s presence, and Israeli authorities have repeatedly confiscated its land, demolished its buildings, and expelled its Palestinian residents for building without permits. This isn’t the community’s first displacement. In the early 1950s, Israeli forces evicted residents from the Tel Arad district of the Negev desert. The community fled to the West Bank and built a village in the current location. They registered as Palestine refugees with the United Nations. In 1977, Israel established the settlement of Ma’ale Adumim, allocating it the land on which Khan al-Ahmar sits. International law prohibits an occupying power from destroying property, including schools, unless “absolutely necessary” for “military operations.” Transferring civilians within an occupied territory, either by direct force or indirect coercion into a place not of their choosing, is a war crime under the International Criminal Court’s statute. Israeli officials should know that the demolition and any resulting displacement of the population may subject them to criminal investigation. Other states also have a duty to ensure that the Geneva Conventions are respected, and should make clear to Israeli officials that, if the demolition goes ahead, people implicated in any criminal acts could be investigated and prosecuted by domestic authorities outside of Israel where they have jurisdiction. Global condemnation alone has not stopped serious war crimes during Israel’s 50-year occupation. Action and justice is long overdue.

News article:
A Palestinian from the northern Jerusalem neighborhood of Beit Hanina, in the central occupied West Bank, demolished his own home on Thursday afternoon, upon order by an Israeli court. Fadi Shawamreh said, according to Ma’an News Agency, that he had to demolish his own home; that was built in 2006, following an order by an Israeli court that the house was not licensed. Shawamreh said that a demolition order against his house was issued after he started renovating the ceiling and walls of the house, over the past two years. He added that he was able to postpone the demolition several times until a final order was issued by the court to demolish the structure. The court allowed Shawamreh until the beginning of September to carry out its order, or else paying demolition fees imposed by the Israeli municipality for crews that would be carrying out the demolition instead. Shawamreh said that Israeli municipality crews, escorted by Israeli forces, had raided his house several months ago to demolish the structure, evacuated its content and assaulted those present at the time, however, the demolition was prevented by a lawyer. He pointed out that the municipality had imposed a fine of 50,000 shekels, on another part of his house, a steel-structure with a cement floor, several years ago. Israel rarely grants Palestinians permits to build in East Jerusalem, though the Jerusalem municipality has claimed that compared to the Jewish population, they receive a disproportionately low number of permit applications from Palestinian communities, which also see high approval ratings. For Jewish Israelis in occupied East Jerusalem’s illegal settlements, the planning, marketing, development and infrastructure are funded and executed by the Israeli government. By contrast, in Palestinian neighborhoods, all the burden falls on individual families to contend with a lengthy permit application that can last several years and cost tens of thousands of dollars. According to Daniel Seidemann of the NGO Terrestrial Jerusalem, “Since 1967, the Government of Israel has directly engaged in the construction of 55,000 units for Israelis in East Jerusalem; in contrast, fewer than 600 units have been built for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the last of which were built 40 years ago. So much for (Jerusalem Mayor Nir) Barkat’s claim ‘we build for everyone.'” (archive photo image)

News article:
Khan Al Ahmar: The Israeli regime on Sunday told residents of Khan Al Ahmar, a Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank slated for demolition, to clear their houses by October 1. Khan Al Ahmar consists of tin and wood shacks built on a desert hillside beside an Israeli highway that runs from occupied Jerusalem to the Dead Sea. The Israeli occupation regime plans to demolish the village and relocate its 180 residents - Bedouins who scrape a living by raising sheep and goats - to a site 12km away, near the Palestinian village of Abu Dis and adjacent to a landfill site. The move has drawn criticism from Palestinians and some European states, who cite the impact on the community and prospects for peace. A spokeswoman for occupation regime’s military liaison agency with the Palestinians said no date had been set for demolition should the houses remain after the deadline. Occupation forces on Sunday morning handed out letters telling residents to voluntarily take down the buildings by October 1 or the occupation regime would enforce the demolition orders. “We will not voluntarily evacuate the place,” said village resident Faisal Abu Dahuk. “The occupation forces that have an army and weapons can evacuate us by force, but there is no other place to go and we refuse to be moved anywhere else.” Israel’s Supreme Court has rejected petitions to prevent the move, siding with the occupation regime which say the village was built without the required permits. Palestinians say such documents are impossible to obtain. Palestinians say the demolition is part of an Israeli push to create an arc of colonies that would effectively cut off occupied East Jerusalem from the West Bank, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and which the Palestinians seek for an independent state.

News article:
With Israeli authorities' demolition of Palestinian village Khan Al-Ahmar imminent, after an October 1 deadline ran out, Amnesty International has declared that the destruction of the community in the occupied West Bank would constitute a "war crime". "Today's planned demolition by Israeli forces of a West Bank village and the forcible transfer of its residents to make way for illegal Jewish settlements is a war crime", Monday's statement began, with some 180 residents facing expulsion by the Israeli army. The planned expulsion has been endorsed twice by Israel's Supreme Court, "following desperate appeal by residents", including a demolition order for "the village's school". The village is slated for destruction on the basis that it "was built without relevant building permits", however, as Amnesty noted, "these are impossible for Palestinians to obtain in Israeli-controlled areas of the West Bank known as Area C". Why Israel Demolishes: Khan Al-Ahmar as Representation of Greater Genocide "Israel's policies of settling Israeli civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, wantonly destroying property and forcibly transferring Palestinians living under occupation, violate the Fourth Geneva Convention and are war crimes listed in the statute of the International Criminal Court." According to Amnesty, "since 1967, Israel has forcibly evicted and displaced entire communities and demolished more than 50,000 Palestinian homes and structures." Saleh Higazi, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Deputy Director, said: "This act is not only heartless and discriminatory, it is illegal". "After nearly a decade of trying to fight the injustice of this demolition, the residents of Khan Al-Ahmar now approach the devastating day when they will see their home of generations torn down before their eyes." "The forcible transfer of the Khan Al-Ahmar community amounts to a war crime. Israel must end its policy of destroying Palestinians' homes and livelihoods to make way for settlements."

News article:
The aftermath of a house demolition in Jerusalem, September 2018. Photo credit: OCHA – OPT. Israeli forces demolished five Palestinian-owned structures in the holy city in September. Israeli authorities continued targeting Palestinian homes and businesses for demolition in the holy city throughout September. On September 20, 2018, Fadi Shwamreh demolished his home in Beit Hanina. According to an Israeli demolition order, if Shawamreh did not demolish his home himself, Israeli forces would raid his home, demolish it, and then charge him for the costs of demolition. Shawamreh reports that his home was built in 2006. Israeli authorities accuse him of building the home without an Israeli construction permit. Fifteen people lived in Shawamreh’s home. On September 5, Israeli forces demolished a Palestinian home in Beit Hanina. The house was owned by Naeem Farrah and his family. Sana Farrah told the Wadi Hilweh Information Center that Israeli forces raided the home and then forced her outside in order to execute the demolition. Israeli police did not allow the family to remove most of their belongings from the house. The family had attempted to postpone the demolition of their home in Israeli courts. “The family built the house 16 years ago and fines were imposed amounting to NIS 120,000. After the fines were paid, the municipality issued a decision to demolish the house,” Sana explained. Eight people lived in the Farrah family home. Israeli forces demolished another Palestinian home on September 5 in Silwan. The home belonged to Ali Abu Sway, who reports he had no prior notice of an impending demolition. Israeli authorities allege his home, which was built five years ago, lacks Israeli construction permits. Israeli forces demolished two homes in Anata on September 4. The homes belonged to the Fahidat family. Ziad Fahidat told Ma’an News that six people lived in them. The Israeli municipality zones only 8 – 13% of East Jerusalem for Palestinian residential construction. As a result, many East Jerusalem residents are forced to build without permits to avoid overcrowding. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel found that 20,000 homes in East Jerusalem – 39% of all homes in East Jerusalem – lack Israeli construction permits. Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem are the target of Israeli settlement plans, which aim to link four concentric circles of settlements, starting with the Old City, followed by the “Holy Basin” (Silwan, Sheikh Jarrah, a-Tur, Mount Zion, and the Kidron Valley), Jerusalem’s annexation border, and finally the West Bank. The United Nations Office of Humanitarian Affairs reports that as of September 24, a total of 306 Palestinian-owned structures have been demolished by Israel this year. The European Union found in August that nearly half of the Palestinian-owned structures demolished by Israeli authorities this year were in the Jerusalem district.

News article:
Israeli authorities demolished a Palestinian home, on Thursday, in the Kuseifeh village of Israel’s Negev desert, under the pretext of being built without the difficult-to-obtain Israeli permit. Local sources told Ma’an News Agency that Israeli crews stormed the village and demolished the structure, leaving a Palestinian family of ten displaced, without a home. Sources confirmed that a Palestinian mother, along with her nine children, lived in the home. Israel uses the pretext of building without a permit to carry out demolitions of Palestinian-owned homes on a regular basis. The Israeli government had approved plans, in 2011, to transfer tens of thousands of Bedouins in unrecognized villages into officially recognized settlements. According to Israeli human rights group Adalah, the plan would “result in the destruction of 35 ‘unrecognized’ Arab Bedouin villages, the forced displacement of up to 70,000 Arab Bedouin citizens of Israel, and the dispossession of their historical lands in the Negev.” More than half of the approximately 160,000 Negev Bedouins reside in unrecognized villages, according to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI). Rights groups have claimed that demolitions in Bedouin villages is a central Israeli policy, aimed at removing the indigenous Palestinian population from the Negev and transferring them to government-zoned townships, to make room for the expansion of Jewish Israeli communities.

News article:
An escalation in US rhetoric in the ongoing trade war with China as well as falling Iranian exports will have an impact on supply and demand, with Opec collectively acting to balance oil markets, the group’s secretary general said yesterday. on Tuesday. "Trade is a major quantum in the overall global economic equation and whatever affects the free flow of trade will ultimately impact growth and will have an impact on oil demand and also on the GDP," Mohammed Barkindo told a conference of energy traders in Fujairah, organised by Gulf Intelligence. Oil prices have recovered from a three-year slump, rising to around $80 per barrel earlier this month, as exports from Iran, Opec's third-largest producer, began to fall due to the onset of US sanctions against the country. The White House has set November 14 as the deadline for countries to stop importing Iranian crude. The exporters’ group in June began to revise an earlier pact to hold back around 1.8 million barrels per day from the market to boost prices. With Brent averaging around $72 for much of the year, Opec, led by Saudi Arabia, added 377,000 bpd back to the market since the second quarter of the year. However, with importers cutting back supplies from Iran, oil markets remain concerned about a possible supply squeeze and higher prices that could trigger production from independent North American shale producers. _______ Read more: Oil production at record but IEA says prices likely to rise Oil trades below $70 as traders assess supply shortage ________ Opec will act collectively to reinforce market balance should the Iran sanctions lead to a supply shock, Mr Barkindo said. “We’re always acting and in the summer of 2014 we learnt our lessons,” he said. "We have to continue to be ahead of the curve on all issues and if need be, also take collective action. It is not the responsibility of one or two producers to take decisions on behalf of all producers,” he added. He stressed that Iran, as a founding member of Opec, would see its concerns addressed adequately by the exporters' group. The group’s technical committee is monitoring and analysing the current dynamics of the oil market, which will be taken up at Opec’s upcoming sub-committee meeting at the Algerian capital on September 24, he said. Opec will also press ahead during the meeting to institutionalise the working relationship with sovereign producers outside the group led by Russia. The National reported in February that the 25 Opec and non-Opec producers undertaking supply corrections will evolve into a super-group by the end of the year. The charter to formalise the relationship will be agreed to and signed during Opec’s annual meeting in Vienna in December, said Mr Barkindo.

The National reported in February that the 25 Opec and non-Opec producers undertaking supply corrections will evolve into a super-group by the end of the year. The charter to formalise the relationship will be agreed to and signed during Opec’s annual meeting in Vienna in December, said Mr Barkindo.

News article:
Fujairah, UAE: The head of OPEC said Tuesday that Iran remains "a very important member" of the oil cartel, as Tehran braces for a new round of US sanctions partially targeting its crude exports. "Iran is a very important member of OPEC... and we have no choice but to continue working with all parties," Mohammad Barkindo said at the Gulf Intelligence Energy Forum in the emirate of Fujairah. Iran remains "a very important exporter of oil," said the chief of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. He did not specify how crude producers would compensate for declining exports from Iran, with new US sanctions due to hit the Islamic republic´s oil industry on November 4. Iran´s OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili said Saturday that OPEC had "not much credit left" and slammed Gulf powerhouses Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for turning it into a "tool for the US". Output from Iran has now hit its lowest level since July 2016, according to the International Energy Agency, as top buyers India and China have distance themselves from Tehran. US President Donald Trump has called for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries members, primarily US ally Saudi Arabia, to raise their production, and warned importers to stop buying oil from Iran or face American sanctions. In 2016, major producers both within and outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to slash production in an attempt to boost prices following the 2014 oil market crash. Barkindo said a "permanent" framework of cooperation between the 14 OPEC members and 11 non-OPEC oil states, including the world´s top producer Russia, was expected in December.

President Trump on Thursday suggested that the U.S. may reconsider military support for countries in the Middle East if members of OPEC don’t bring down oil prices. “We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!” Trump tweeted.

Meanwhile, Iran warned that it would veto any decision from the group that harms its national interests as it reels from sanctions implemented by the Trump administration last month. Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, Iran’s oil minister, said any decision on a new production agreement would be “void” and “invalid” without Iran’s support, Bloomberg reported. Trump has previously taken aim at OPEC through Twitter, referring to it as a monopoly on multiple occasions. In July, he accused the organization of oil exporters of doing “little to help” rising gas prices. In June, he again blamed the organization for “artificially high” gas prices, tweeting that “OPEC is at it again.”

News article:
Oil prices slipped on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump called on OPEC to “get prices down now!” ahead of a meeting of major oil exporters in Algeria this weekend, Reuters reports. Brent crude oil LCOc1 was down 40 cents at $79.00 a barrel by 1225 GMT. U.S. light crude oil CLc1 was unchanged at $71.12 a barrel after rising nearly 2 percent on Wednesday. The North Sea benchmark has been trading close to $80 a barrel, near its highest for almost four years, on expectations that U.S. sanctions against Iran, OPEC’s third biggest producer, will reduce supply in world markets. The U.S. sanctions were imposed by Trump in response to Iran’s nuclear program, which the White House says is designed to produce weapons, an allegation Tehran denies. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, meet on Sunday in Algeria to discuss how to allocate supply increases to offset the loss of Iranian barrels. The meeting is unlikely to agree an official rise in crude output, although pressure is mounting on top producers to prevent a spike in prices. U.S. President Donald Trump weighed into the debate via Twitter on Thursday, urging OPEC to cut prices. “The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!,” Trump said. “We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember.” Despite the president’s intervention, market sentiment remained fairly bullish with many traders and analysts expecting Brent to move above $80 soon. “Brent is definitely fighting the $80 line, wanting to break above,” said SEB Markets chief commodities analyst Bjarne Schieldrop. “But this is likely going to break very soon.” The market remained bullish after news of another fall in U.S. crude inventories. U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell for a fifth straight week to 3-1/2 year lows in the week to Sept. 14, while gasoline inventories also showed a larger than expected draw on unseasonably strong demand, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell by 2.1 million barrels, compared with expectations for a decrease of 2.7 million barrels. U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports come into force on Nov. 4 and many buyers have already scaled back Iranian purchases. It is unclear how easily other producers, such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Russia, can compensate for lost supply.

News article:
US President Donald Trump has accused OPEC’s Middle East producers of “pushing for higher and higher oil prices.” Trump, who is a proponent of cheap crude, has told OPEC countries they would not be safe for long without the US. We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 20 сентября 2018 г. Oil prices showed a mixed reaction to Trump’s words. The Brent benchmark fell 43 cents to $78.97 per barrel, while the US Texas Intermediate grew 9 cents to $71.21. This is not the first time Trump has attacked OPEC and blamed it for high oil prices. Asked by Fox on July 1 if someone was manipulating oil markets, Trump said: “OPEC is and they better stop it because we’re protecting those countries, many of those countries.” In a follow-up Tweet on July 4, the president said that “the United States defends many of those countries for very little $’s.” Why does Trump so badly want low oil prices? De-facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and Russia have an agreement to curb oil production. The kingdom, its Gulf allies and Russia have recently agreed to lift production by about 1 million barrels per day (bpd) to offset losses from Venezuela and Iran, but not more. This keeps oil no lower than $75 per barrel. As oil prices remain high, prices for gasoline in the US are growing. The average cost of gasoline has risen 60 percent from $1.87 per gallon in February 2016 to over $3 in September. Higher oil prices have boosted economies of producing states North Dakota, Texas and others. “But most of those states are solidly Republican and likely to vote for Trump’s party at the mid-term congressional elections in 2018,” said John Kemp, a Reuters market analyst. “The president, therefore, is paying much closer attention to the harmful impact of higher oil and gasoline prices on consumers in swing states.” One of the largest factors for the oil price surge is Trump’s sanctions war against Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, analysts have said. As Iran oil sales decline, the supply goes down, and prices grow. Does the US really protect the Middle East? Iran is not the only country in the Middle East which could find Trump’s so-called protection claim questionable. Trump has said several times that without the US, OPEC countries would not be safe. OPEC members such as Libya, Iraq, Venezuela would surely doubt that. A 2011 NATO military intervention in Libya to oust the country’s leader, Muammar Gaddafi, fueled a major conflict which took the lives of thousands of civilians. In the war, Libya lost more than half of its 1.6 million barrels per day in oil production, something which still hasn’t returned to 1 million. OPEC’s second-largest oil producer, Iraq, suffered a US military invasion in 2003. Iran and Venezuela are under tough US sanctions which have slashed their oil exports and triggered a currency crisis. For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section

News article:
Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, pledged to block any supply increases, saying that the price jump was caused by Trump’s decision to put additional sanctions on Iranian oil. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said he would personally block any OPEC decision that would harm Iran’s interests, Bloomberg reported. “Any country that says it can make up for the shortfall in the market is siding with the US,” Zanganeh told reporters in Tehran on Thursday, also noting that he will not attend the JMMC meeting, saying that $80 a barrel is a “suitable” price and declaring that any decision made by the JMMC to increase production would be “void” and “invalid.” Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, the only oil producer able to adjust its output, will not be able to produce 12 million barrels per day to cover Iranian oil exports once Washington introduces restrictions, media reported. The state-run Saudi Arabian Oil Company, known as Saudi Aramco, had been informing its customers its crude would be in short supply in October, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing Saudi officials. Moreover, the company would not be able to meet the demand for crude in the long term once Tehran, currently producing around 1.9 million barrels per day, wold be be banned from exporting oil, the outlet added. August’s OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report showed that Saudi Arabia’s output reached 10.44 million barrels per day that month. "[Producing] 11 million [barrels a day] is already a stretch, even for just a few months," a Saudi official told the Wall Street Journal.

The image is a chart of oil prices. The chart shows that oil prices have been increasing since May 2023. The article is about the recent increase in oil prices. The article states that the increase in oil prices is due to a number of factors, including the decision by OPEC to cut oil production and the increased demand for oil from China.

The sub-event that is most relevant to the image is sub-event 7. Sub-event 7 states that Saudi Arabian Oil Co. (Aramco) will provide aid to crude short supply. This sub-event is relevant to the image because it is about the supply of oil. The image shows that the supply of oil has been decreasing since May 2023. This decrease in supply is one of the factors that has caused the increase in oil prices.

WASHINGTON: U.S. President Donald Trump linked American support for Middle Eastern countries to oil prices on Thursday as he again urged OPEC to lower prices. "We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!" Trump wrote on Twitter. The Republican president has lashed out at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries over the past several months. Rising U.S. gasoline prices could create a political headache for Trump before November congressional elections by offsetting Republican claims that his tax cuts and rollbacks of federal regulations have helped boost the U.S. economy. Trump has called on Saudi Arabia, OPEC´s largest producer, to raise output, saying that it should help the United States lower fuel prices since Washington is aiding Riyadh in its struggle against Iran. OPEC and its allies are unlikely to agree to an official increase in crude output when they meet in Algeria this weekend, although pressure is mounting on top producers to prevent a spike in oil prices ahead of new U.S. sanctions on Iran, OPEC sources told Reuters on Thursday. The new sanctions take effect in November, as a result of with Trump´s decision to pull out of a 2015 agreement on Iran´s nuclear program. Saudi Arabia is worried that any sanctions-related spike in oil prices will trigger fresh criticism from Trump, but it also faces doubts over its ability to compensate for a drop in Iranian supply, the sources said. In a visit to Moscow this month, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said Saudi Arabia, the United States and Russia can between them raise global output in the next 18 months to compensate for falling oil supplies from Iran.

News article:
London, Kuwait: Opec and its allies are pumping half a million barrels a day below the target they set two months ago as output drops in countries from Iran to Venezuela. The group is currently over-complying by 29 per cent, meaning it’s pumping less than it pledged. While there won’t be any new production proposal at a meeting this weekend in Algiers, a renewed pledge to bring the group back to 100 per cent compliance with targets would allow Saudi Arabia to open the taps. Opec+ officials are in Algiers to review production figures ahead of a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee on Sunday, a group that includes the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia and Russia and observes producers’ compliance. Officials are so far not discussing any proposal beyond a June agreement to achieve 100 per cent compliance with quotas initially established in 2016, the delegates said. Oil prices have climbed about 18 per cent this year amid mounting concern that dwindling production in some countries will cause a shortfall. Declines in Iran, Venezuela, Kazakhstan and Mexico are largely to blame for the over-compliance in August, delegates said. Yet divisions in the Opec are making it almost impossible to agree on collective action to cool the rally. While Saudi Arabia — along with non-Opec ally Russia — is eager to temper prices with more supply, Iran feels such moves would steal the market share it’s losing to US sanctions. While delegates attributed the August compliance figure to declines in certain nations, output estimates from the International Energy Agency suggest a figure closer to 100 per cent for August. In any event, the so-called JMMC has no mandate to decide on how output increases will be shared out to reach full compliance, delegates said, adding that the decision will be taken at the next ministerial meeting in Vienna. The question is just how much oil is going to be taken off the market with US sanctions on Iran. I think that the market is building up energy for another try at multi-year highs.” - Gene McGillian | Director of market research at Tradition Energy Meanwhile, oil prices ended the week giving back most earlier gains after news that major producers would consider additional supply a day after US President Donald Trump again blasted Opec. Investors grappled with whether the Opec and non-Opec producers will offset a shortfall from Iran once US sanctions go into full force November 4. Major producers are scheduled to gather in Algeria on Sunday. “The question is just how much oil is going to be taken off the market with US sanctions on Iran,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy. Compounding declining production in Venezuela, Iran’s production cuts could lead to a much tighter supply picture, he said. “I think that the market is building up energy for another try at multi-year highs.” Global benchmark Brent crude settled 10 cents higher at $78.80 (Dh289.39) a barrel.

News article:
Algiers (AFP) - A meeting between oil producing countries on Sunday decided not to alter supply to the global market, after calls by US President Donald Trump for an immediate hike in output to reduce prices. A committee of participating states "expressed its satisfaction regarding the current oil market outlook with an overall healthy balance between supply and demand", a statement said, at the end of a meeting in Algiers. But Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih left the way open to a future production hike, as supplies tighten due to the US imposing sanctions on Iranian oil from November this year. "It is critical that we continue to foresee and anticipate changing market supply and demand balances and take proactive actions to avoid conditions that could make (oil) consumers uneasy and anxious," said Falih, who chairs the joint committee of OPEC and non-OPEC countries. The OPEC cartel in December 2016 concluded an agreement with non-member states -- including Russia -- to reduce output in order to arrest sliding prices. Sunday's meeting in Algiers brought together OPEC oil ministers and non-OPEC signatories to the 2016 agreement, as they seek to extend their cooperation. Trump has repeatedly called for a hike in production by countries other than Iran to reduce oil prices, which have partially recovered since the December 2016 agreement, to trade close to $80 per barrel this month. "We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices!" Trump tweeted on Thursday. "We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!" The committee formed by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers "was directed to study the 2019 outlook and present options on 2019 production levels to prevent market imbalance", the closing statement in Algiers added. - 'Spare capacity' ready to deploy - Story continues Falih said attending ministers "showed us that they have spare capacity that they are ready to deploy if there is demand for it, if it is required by any shortfall". But he said producers would reduce "supply if there is ever... a demand shock to the market". "It's premature to say what we're going to do in 2019," he added. Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak on Sunday appeared to back a continuation of the partnership between OPEC and non-OPEC member states. "We need to give serious thought to expand our partnership beyond this year to tackling the new challenges that appear ahead of us," he said. After pulling out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal in May this year, the Trump administration has pledged to impose an embargo on Iranian oil from November 5. Iran's OPEC representative Hossein Kazempour Ardebili on Sunday said his country was continuing to meet its OPEC quota share. "I expect all countries to exercise their sovereignty and not to abide by the instructions of Trump," he said. But output from Iran has hit its lowest level since July 2016, according to the International Energy Agency, as top buyers India and China distance themselves from Tehran in anticipation of the US sanctions.

News article:
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global Benchmark Brent crude jumped more than 3 percent on Monday to a four-year high above $80 a barrel after Saudi Arabia and Russia ruled out any immediate increase in production despite calls by U.S. President Donald Trump for action to raise global supply. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC states, including top producer Russia, gathered in Algiers on Sunday for a meeting that ended with no formal recommendation for any additional supply boost to counter falling supply from Iran. “The market’s still being driven by concerns about Iranian and Venezuelan supply,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford. “The failure of the producers to address that adequately this weekend is creating a buying opportunity.” Brent crude LCOc1 settled up $2.40 or 3.1 percent at $81.20 a barrel, after touching an intraday high of $81.39, the highest since November, 2014. U.S. light crude CLc1 settled up $1.30, or 1.8 percent, higher at $72.08. (U.S. oil drilling, production & storage levels: tmsnrt.rs/2OKP4nJ) OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and its biggest oil-producer ally outside the group, Russia, on Sunday effectively rebuffed Trump’s demand for moves to cool the market. “I do not influence prices,” Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters on Sunday. Trump said last week that OPEC “must get prices down now!”, but Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Monday OPEC had not responded positively to Trump’s demands. “It is now increasingly evident, that in the face of producers reluctant to raise output, the market will be confronted with supply gaps in the next three-six months that it will need to resolve through higher oil prices,” BNP Paribas oil strategist Harry Tchilinguirian told Reuters Global Oil Forum. Commodity traders Trafigura and Mercuria said Brent could rise to $90 per barrel by Christmas and pass $100 in early 2019, as markets tighten once U.S. sanctions against Iran are fully implemented from November. JPMorgan said U.S. sanctions on Iran could lead to a loss of 1.5 million barrels per day, while Mercuria warned that as much as 2 million bpd could be knocked out of the market. Concerns about production shortfalls are encouraging traders to place more long bets, boosting Brent prices, said Brian LaRose, a technical analyst at United-ICAP. “This is the seventh time over the last couple of months that we have challenged the highs,” he said, referring to individual monthly contracts, rather than a continuation contract. If Brent prices climb past $82 a barrel, he said prices up to $90 would be a near-term possibility. Some have said softening demand from trade tensions between the U.S. and China to offset loss of Iranian supply, but Tradition’s McGillian said that unless trade tensions show signs of eroding Chinese demand, oil prices will surge further. U.S. commercial crude oil inventories C-STK-T-EIA are at their lowest since early 2015. While U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA is near a record high of 11 million bpd, subdued U.S. drilling points toward a slowdown in output.

TEHRAN: Iran on Sunday called on its OPEC partners not to bow to "threats" from US President Donald Trump, as the oil cartel prepared to meet to discuss output levels. "I hope the outcome of this meeting will not be affected by President Trump´s threats," Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh told SHANA, his ministry's news agency. Ahead of Sunday's meeting in Algiers of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Trump tweeted that "the OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!" by raising output. Middle East states "would not be safe for very long" without the United States, the president also wrote Thursday. Zanganeh fired back, saying the claim that "America safeguards the security and survival of producing countries" was the "biggest insult to American allies in the region". "OPEC is an organisation independent of America and will hopefully stay so," he said.

News article:
LONDON: Saudi Arabia and Russia won´t add significantly more oil to the market because of a lack of capacity, a top Iranian official said on Monday, predicting prices will probably rise further. On Sunday, ministers and officials from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus Russia and other allies ruled out an immediate oil-output boost, in effect rebuffing U.S. President Donald Trump´s calls for action. The move helped push crude prices to a four-year high near $81 a barrel on Monday. Also underpinning the market is the prospect of lower exports from Iran, OPEC´s third-largest producer, due to U.S. sanctions. Iran´s OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said in comments to Reuters that Saudi Arabia and Russia were unable and unwilling to add more production at short notice. "They are doing little and late, to get prices higher," he said. "They got prices higher and they are going to get them higher still. There is no spare capacity. They cannot deliver the extra capacity that they claim." Saudi Arabia, OPEC´s biggest producer, says it can add an extra 1.5 million barrels per day - about 1.5 percent of world demand - to the market. But Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Sunday such a move was not needed at the moment. Sunday´s meeting appeared to leave unresolved a disagreement which flared up in June between Saudi Arabia and Iran over whether OPEC members are allowed to pump more oil to make up shortfalls elsewhere. Under pressure from Trump, OPEC and allies agreed in June to boost production, after months of undersupply by OPEC countries including Venezuela and Angola and the prospect of the Iran sanctions. Saudi Arabia said the deal allowed countries able to produce more, such as itself, to go ahead and do so, to make up for shortfalls. Iran disagreed and Kazempour maintained that position on Monday. "Extra production beyond OPEC quotas requires permission of the conference," he said. "Assignment of OPEC share to non-OPEC requires conference approval." The next meeting of the conference - the full group of OPEC and non-OPEC ministers, is not until December. The OPEC governor is typically the second most senior post in a country´s OPEC delegation after the oil minister. Iran´s minister, Bijan Zanganeh, was quoted on Monday as saying the meeting did not give a positive response to Trump.

News article:
United Nations: US President Donald Trump accused members of the OPEC oil cartel of “ripping off” the world on Tuesday as he called for a lowering of fuel prices. “The United States stands ready to export our abundant affordable supply of oil, clean coal, and natural gas,” Trump told the United Nations General Assembly. “OPEC and OPEC nations are, as usual, ripping off the rest of the world, and I don’t like it. Nobody should like it.” Earlier, President Trump, in a tweet, linked US support for Middle Eastern countries to oil prices and repeatedly urged OPEC to lower prices. OPEC and its allies reduced oil output in August as a drop in Iranian supply due to US sanctions. Global energy demand is expected to grow by 33 percent to 2040, the Secretary General of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Mohammad Barkindo said, citing the group’s long-term world oil outlook, released on Sunday. Oil would continue to have a predominant role in the energy mix for the foreseeable future, Barkindo said.

News article:
London - Asharq Al-Awsat US data showed a build in domestic crude inventories, but an impending drop in Iranian exports kept Brent futures above $80 a barrel and on track for a fifth straight quarterly gain, as oil prices eased on Wednesday. Speaking on the sidelines of United Nations meetings in New York, US special envoy for Iran, Brian Hook announced his country will make sure the oil market is well supplied before it reimposes oil sanctions against Iran on November 4. “We will ensure prior to the re-imposition of our sanctions that we have a well-supplied oil market,” Hook told a news conference. US is encouraging Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to increase supply in order to push prices down, meanwhile, a Nigerian oil industry official said on Wednesday that OPEC will act to balance the market after oil prices hit their highest in four years, but its options may be limited by available spare capacity. “It’s obvious that if you have high prices it’ll affect demand, so you have to do some market balance,” Malam Mele Kyari, head of crude oil marketing at Nigeria’s state oil firm NNPC and also the country’s OPEC representative, told Reuters. Kyari indicated that OPEC will do everything to stabilize and balance the market, however, there’s a limit to what they can do. “You must have the spare capacity,” asserted Kyari. Several big buyers, such as a number of Indian refiners, have signaled they will wind down purchases of Iranian crude but the impact on global markets is not yet clear. The US will impose new sanctions on Iran in November and the expected loss in Iranian supplies is the main reason behind increased prices recently. OPEC and its independent producers, including Russia, met earlier this week but decided not to boost output. Meanwhile, Brent remains on course for its fifth consecutive quarterly increase, the longest stretch since early 2007 when a six-quarter run led to a record-high price of $147.50 a barrel. Unlike most investments banks, Goldman Sachs reiterated its view that "Brent prices will stabilize back in their $70-80/bbl range into year-end." Goldman Sachs stated that the lack of new production growth guidance by OPEC does not reflect a desire to let prices appreciate meaningfully further, but rather the historical pattern of OPEC responding to rather than front-running production losses. "We continue to expect that the decline in Iran exports will reach 1.4 million barrels per day, and while it is occurring faster than we had previously expected, we continue to expect it to remain offset by a faster ramp-up in production from other producers,” added Goldman in its report. US officials, including President Donald Trump, are trying to reassure consumers and investors that enough supply will remain in the oil market and have pushed OPEC to raise output. In a Tuesday speech at the United Nations, Trump reiterated calls on OPEC to pump more oil, accused Iran of sowing chaos and promised further sanctions on the country. On the supply front, American Petroleum Institute figures showed that US crude inventories rose by 2.9-million barrels in the week to September 21 to 400-million, compared with analyst expectations for a decrease of 1.3-million barrels.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print By Staff Writer While US crude inventories are growing, the price of Brent futures has remained steady at $80 a barrel and are on track for a fifth straight quarterly gain, likely due to the impending drop in Iranian regime’s exports.

He said: “We will ensure prior to the re-imposition of our sanctions that we have a well-supplied oil market.” The US is doing this by ensuring that Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are increasing supplies to reduce prices and a Nigerian oil industry official said on Wednesday that this will help balance the market after oil prices hit a four-year high, but warned that limited capacity may reduce its options.

The US sanctions come into place on November 4, following Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal, which lifted sanctions on the Iranian Regime in favour of restrictions on their nuclear programme, which Trump said did not go far enough. He has pushed OPEC to increase production to ensure enough supply remains in the oil market, but OPEC and its independent producers, including Russia, met earlier this week and agreed not to boost output.

These sanctions are welcomed by the Iranian people as it will limit the amount of money that the Regime has to spend on abusing its own people.

News article:
As oil prices have risen under White House pressure on foreign nations to curb Iran's oil exports, Russia and Saudi Arabia have "quietly" responded by increasing production to keep prices low. The world's top two oil producers struck a deal to raise output starting last month and continuing through December, Reuters reported Thursday. The news comes as the benchmark Brent crude price increased to $85 per barrel, up 27 percent over the same time last year. With the implementation of U.S. sanctions in August and a second round taking effect next month, analysts have raised concerns that prices could rise even further without other producers stepping in to fill the gap. According to a Reuters source, energy ministers from Riyadh and Moscow "agreed to add barrels to the market quietly with a view not to look like they are acting on [President Donald] Trump's order to pump more." Another source confirmed that the Saudi minister told the U.S. the kingdom would increase supply if customers request more. Last month, Russia already broke its post-Soviet era record for oil output, according to Bloomberg. The country increased its production by nearly 150,000 barrels per day over the previous month, reaching nearly 11.3 million barrels of oil and condensate a day. "I would expect Russia's oil production will hover at around 11.4 million to 11.6 million bpd until the end of 2018 and may increase further to 11.8 million bpd later on in 2019," a source from a major Russian oil company told Reuters. Since summer, Trump has been pushing allies and trading partners to cut imports of Iranian oil, while also urging OPEC members to fill the gap. "Hope OPEC will increase output substantially. Need to keep prices down!" Trump tweeted in June, ahead of sanctions taking effect. Last month, the president reiterated his calls, tweeting "the Opec monopoly must get prices down now!" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih confirmed publicly last month that the kingdom's production was "below 10 million barrels a day for the first five months of the year; in October we're producing about 10.7 million," according to Radio Free Europe. He said that he expected supplies in November to be even higher, and pointed out that the United Arab Emirates and Iraq had also increased production. Tehran has responded with criticism, arguing that Moscow and Riyadh have broken their agreements with OPEC. It also has insisted that the increase won't be enough to make up for the deficit of removing Iranian oil from the international market. The Islamic Republic produces around 3.8 million barrels per day on average. As of now, oil prices are the highest they've been in nearly four years. Analysts believe the prices will continue to increase before lowering. "Prices will probably rise further into overshoot territory. Once we see $90, I would expect decisive supply reaction," Commerzbank strategist Carsten Fritsch told Reuters. "Major economies won't let oil prices rise to triple digits and harm economic growth."

With the implementation of U.S. sanctions in August and a second round taking effect next month, analysts have raised concerns that prices could rise even further without other producers stepping in to fill the gap. According to a Reuters source, energy ministers from Riyadh and Moscow "agreed to add barrels to the market quietly with a view not to look like they are acting on [President Donald] Trump's order to pump more." Another source confirmed that the Saudi minister told the U.S. the kingdom would increase supply if customers request more. Last month, Russia already broke its post-Soviet era record for oil output, according to Bloomberg. The country increased its production by nearly 150,000 barrels per day over the previous month, reaching nearly 11.3 million barrels of oil and condensate a day. "I would expect Russia's oil production will hover at around 11.4 million to 11.6 million bpd until the end of 2018 and may increase further to 11.8 million bpd later on in 2019," a source from a major Russian oil company told Reuters. Since summer, Trump has been pushing allies and trading partners to cut imports of Iranian oil, while also urging OPEC members to fill the gap. "Hope OPEC will increase output substantially. Need to keep prices down!" Trump tweeted in June, ahead of sanctions taking effect. Last month, the president reiterated his calls, tweeting "the Opec monopoly must get prices down now!" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih confirmed publicly last month that the kingdom's production was "below 10 million barrels a day for the first five months of the year; in October we're producing about 10.7 million," according to Radio Free Europe. He said that he expected supplies in November to be even higher, and pointed out that the United Arab Emirates and Iraq had also increased production. Tehran has responded with criticism, arguing that Moscow and Riyadh have broken their agreements with OPEC. It also has insisted that the increase won't be enough to make up for the deficit of removing Iranian oil from the international market. The Islamic Republic produces around 3.8 million barrels per day on average. As of now, oil prices are the highest they've been in nearly four years. Analysts believe the prices will continue to increase before lowering. "Prices will probably rise further into overshoot territory. Once we see $90, I would expect decisive supply reaction," Commerzbank strategist Carsten Fritsch told Reuters. "Major economies won't let oil prices rise to triple digits and harm economic growth."

News article:
Saudi Arabia’s crown prince in an interview with Bloomberg News is insisting that the kingdom is fulfilling promises to the United States to make up a shortfall in world oil supplies resulting from the loss of Iranian production under U.S. sanctions. "The request that America made to Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries is to be sure that if there is any loss of supply from Iran, that we will supply that," Muhammad Bin Salman, heir to the Saudi throne, told Bloomberg in an interview published on October 5. "And that happened." Salman said a coalition of producers from OPEC has recently boosted output by 1.5 million barrels a day, which is double the 700,000-barrel decline in output experienced so far by Iran under the threat of U.S. sanctions on its oil sector, which are due to take effect on November 5. "We export as much as two barrels for any barrel that disappeared from Iran recently," the prince said. "So we did our job and more." Yet that hasn't stopped U.S. President Donald Trump from continuing to blame the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for a sharp rise in prices this year, even as his administration vows to choke off all of Iran's oil exports. The increased production also failed this week to prevent premium crude prices from hitting a four-year high above $86 a barrel in London trading. Oil traders say they are concerned that the kingdom isn’t ramping up output quickly enough, and that it may not have enough capacity to fully cover Iran’s losses. 'Maxed Out' Saudi Arabia is now pumping about 10.7 million barrels a day -- close to a record -- and can add a further 1.3 million "if the market needs that," Salman told Bloomberg. However, some analysts doubt that 12 million barrels a day can be reached quickly, or maintained for an extended period. "Near-term spare capacity is effectively maxed out," said Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. The Saudi prince claimed in the Bloomberg interview that the kingdom could push its capacity beyond 12 million barrels a day with additional investment, and that extra supplies are also available from its allies in the Persian Gulf region. The so-called OPEC+ coalition includes other Gulf producers like the United Arab Emirates, as well as countries outside OPEC such as Russia. However, Russia, which rivals the Saudis as a top global producer, does not support the U.S. sanctions against Iran and has vowed to help Iran get around them and keep exporting oil. Trump announced he would reimpose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran in May after walking away from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. But Russia, China, and the three European powers that also signed the deal have continued to honor it and are working with Iran on ways to evade the U.S. sanctions. Russian President Vladimir Putin, like Iran, has blamed Trump’s abandonment of the nuclear deal for the sharp rise in oil prices this year. The Saudis, by contrast, are bitter rivals with Iran in the Middle Eastern region and applauded Trump's decision to quit the nuclear deal. Trump at the time said he expected the Saudis and other Gulf allies to make up the shortfall in Iranian production that would result from the sanctions. Iran's oil output reached a peak of about 4 million barrels a day after global sanctions were lifted in 2016 in exchange for curbs on its nuclear activities under the nuclear deal. But its output has declined sharply in recent months under the threat of U.S. sanctions. The Saudi prince contended in the Bloomberg interview that the most recent sharp rise in prices to over $80 a barrel is actually being driven by output losses in other countries, not Iran. "The higher price that we have in the last month, it’s not because of Iran," he said. "It’s mostly because of things happening in Canada and Mexico, Libya, Venezuela, and other countries." On a related matter, Reuters reported on October 5 that Indian crude importers intend to keep buying oil from Iran in November after U.S. sanctions go into effect and are seeking a waiver from the sanctions from Washington.

News article:
* Hopes slim for oil flows after difficult talks * Tensions over Qatar, Iran add to difficulties * U.S. asks Saudi to raise output, wants lower oil price * Cost of maintaining Neutral Zone fields rises each year DUBAI/LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will struggle to resume oil production from jointly operated fields any time soon due to operational differences and souring political ties between the previously close Gulf OPEC allies, sources familiar with the matter said. The two countries halted output from the jointly run oilfields - Khafji and Wafra - in the so-called Neutral Zone more than three years ago, cutting some 500,000 barrels per day or 0.5 percent of global oil supply. As oil prices rose to a four-year high above $85 per barrel this year, Washington has been pressing its top Gulf ally Riyadh to reduce crude prices by increasing production. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visited Kuwait last month to discuss a resumption of oil output from the zone. But the sources, who asked not to be identified as they are prohibited from discussing the issue publicly, said the talks failed to move the two countries closer to a deal as Kuwait resisted Riyadh’s push for greater control of the fields. “It did not go well because Kuwaiti sovereignty is non-negotiable,” one source told Reuters. Riyadh does not want Kuwaiti laws to apply to U.S. oil major Chevron, which operates the Wafra onshore field on behalf of the Saudi government, the source added. Another source said Saudi Arabia wanted a bigger say and more control in running oil operations in the zone. Prince Mohammed met Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah and Crown Prince Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah but the visit was cut short from the originally planned two days to just a few hours on the night of Sept. 30, the sources said. POLITICAL TENSIONS Adding to the political friction were tensions between the two countries over the embargo of neighbouring Qatar and diverging views on relations with Saudi Arabia’s arch-foe Iran, the sources said. Kuwait is trying to mediate the embargo, which is being led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt cut diplomatic, transport and trade ties with Doha last year, accusing it of financing terrorism. Qatar rejects the charges. Kuwait has sought to maintain neutrality, although the Emir’s efforts to mediate the rift have had little success so far. Kuwait, which has a sizeable Shi’ite Muslim minority, has also maintained dialogue with Shi’ite Iran. Saudi Arabia and Iran back opposing sides in civil wars in Syria and Yemen. In a move that may further complicate relations with Riyadh, Kuwait this month signed a defence cooperation plan with Turkey in what it said was meant to strengthen bilateral ties. Turkey has sided with Qatar in the Gulf row and its relations with Riyadh have been strained due to Ankara’s close ties with Iran. “The (regional) situation is not stable, so every country should think how to protect itself,” Saleh Ashour, a member of the Kuwaiti parliament, told Reuters. COSTLY IDLE WELLS Oil output in the Neutral Zone, which dates back to 1920s treaties establishing regional borders, is divided equally between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The Wafra field is operated by state-run Kuwait Gulf Oil Co and Chevron on behalf of Saudi Arabia. The Khafji field is operated by state oil giant Saudi Aramco and Kuwait Gulf Oil. Tensions have been simmering since the last decade, when Kuwait was angered by a Saudi decision to prolong Chevron’s Wafra concession until 2039 without consulting Kuwait. In 2014, Saudi Arabia closed Khafji, citing environmental issues. In 2015, Chevron shut Wafra after failing to agree operating rights with Kuwait. Shutting output is expensive because it requires investments of tens of millions of dollars per year for maintenance, sources familiar with field operations said. The Neutral Zone “is the single biggest asset in the world which was deliberately stopped and hasn’t been producing for three years”, one of the sources said. “The more the restart is postponed the more it will cost to maintain it. And the more problematic it might be to restart the fields quickly and fully,” he added. Industry sources from both countries say that though Khafji and Wafra are not linked geographically, an agreement to bring one field back online would be tied to the other.

News article:
EU looking at payment system with Iran to thwart US sanctions IRNA - Islamic Republic News Agency Tehran, Sept 15, IRNA -- The European Union's biggest economic powers are planning to create a "special purpose" financial company to thwart US President Donald Trump's sanctions and help Iran continue to sell oil in Europe and do business transactions. The move by France, Germany and Britain, and supported by the EU comes after Trump in May unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear accord, which the Europeans, Russia and China continue to support and have pledged to do their utmost to protect. EU officials on Friday confirmed the plan to create the "special purpose vehicle," which was first reported by Spiegel, the German news site. When asked about the financing model, a spokesperson for the German Finance Ministry said, "The German government is working together with the European External Action Service and the European Commission, as well as France and the United Kingdom, on maintaining financial payment channels with Iran. The negotiations on this are intensive and ongoing. There are different models under consideration. "As you know, it is a central goal of the EU and the German government to ensure that the processing of transactions is secured," she said during a regular government news conference. "All options are being considered." A French official added the EU needed "a financially independent sovereign channel" in order to keep the Iran deal alive. The plan under review in Berlin and Brussels would involve establishing a kind of clearing house for all European trade with Iran. A form of commercial entity known as a "special purpose vehicle" would be established, with European governments as shareholders. The new company would act as an intermediary for cross-border payments to and from Iran, with no involvement from European commercial or central banks, which are frightened of becoming the target of American countermeasures. The clearinghouse is likely to be based in Luxembourg, but its capitalization remains unclear. The European Investment Bank and national development banks, like Germany's KfW, may be involved, although here too there is genuine fear of American retribution. One EU official explained that the "special purpose vehicle" would effectively function as an accounting firm, providing a loophole to keep trade flowing between EU countries and Iran. If Italy wanted to buy Iranian oil, it could wire money to the firm, which would handle the rest of the transaction. Iran, similarly, could wire money for the purchase of European products. The special purpose vehicle would keep the money for the transactions within the EU, and outside the reach of US control over global money-transfer systems. It would also avoid the need to use banks that are afraid of being cut off from doing business in the US financial market if they are accused by the US Treasury Department of violating the sanctions. A first battery of renewed US economic sanctions took effect against Iran last month, and further sanctions – including sanctions on the Iranian oil sector, a mainstay of the country's economy – are set to take hold in November. While the EU has already taken steps to obstruct Trump's sanctions – including potential penalties against firms that enforce the American sanctions without permission of the European Commission – officials in Europe still fear that the US dominance of the world financial system will block most business with Iran. Tehran itself has warned the Europeans that they should develop new ways of trading with Iran by early November if they want to preserve the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The US wants all businesses and countries around the world to stop doing business with Iran. News of the EU plan comes only two days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker vowed in his final State of the Union address to increase the role of the euro in international trade, particularly in terms of energy purchases. Word of the European plan to prop up Iran's oil industry is certain to further damage the already badly-strained transatlantic relationship. European governments have rarely acted so decisively in opposition to American foreign policy. Their action is partly motivated by what is viewed as an American attack on European sovereignty. Trump's government is seen as coercing compliance rather than working out agreed policy. A determined effort to get around US sanctions would also encourage European businesses to stay the course in Iran. Reuters, politico.eu and handelsblatt.com contributed to this story.

News article:
EU looking at payment system with Iran to thwart US sanctions IRNA - Islamic Republic News Agency Tehran, Sept 15, IRNA -- The European Union's biggest economic powers are planning to create a "special purpose" financial company to thwart US President Donald Trump's sanctions and help Iran continue to sell oil in Europe and do business transactions. The move by France, Germany and Britain, and supported by the EU comes after Trump in May unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear accord, which the Europeans, Russia and China continue to support and have pledged to do their utmost to protect. EU officials on Friday confirmed the plan to create the "special purpose vehicle," which was first reported by Spiegel, the German news site. When asked about the financing model, a spokesperson for the German Finance Ministry said, "The German government is working together with the European External Action Service and the European Commission, as well as France and the United Kingdom, on maintaining financial payment channels with Iran. The negotiations on this are intensive and ongoing. There are different models under consideration. "As you know, it is a central goal of the EU and the German government to ensure that the processing of transactions is secured," she said during a regular government news conference. "All options are being considered." A French official added the EU needed "a financially independent sovereign channel" in order to keep the Iran deal alive. The plan under review in Berlin and Brussels would involve establishing a kind of clearing house for all European trade with Iran. A form of commercial entity known as a "special purpose vehicle" would be established, with European governments as shareholders. The new company would act as an intermediary for cross-border payments to and from Iran, with no involvement from European commercial or central banks, which are frightened of becoming the target of American countermeasures. The clearinghouse is likely to be based in Luxembourg, but its capitalization remains unclear. The European Investment Bank and national development banks, like Germany's KfW, may be involved, although here too there is genuine fear of American retribution. One EU official explained that the "special purpose vehicle" would effectively function as an accounting firm, providing a loophole to keep trade flowing between EU countries and Iran. If Italy wanted to buy Iranian oil, it could wire money to the firm, which would handle the rest of the transaction. Iran, similarly, could wire money for the purchase of European products. The special purpose vehicle would keep the money for the transactions within the EU, and outside the reach of US control over global money-transfer systems. It would also avoid the need to use banks that are afraid of being cut off from doing business in the US financial market if they are accused by the US Treasury Department of violating the sanctions. A first battery of renewed US economic sanctions took effect against Iran last month, and further sanctions – including sanctions on the Iranian oil sector, a mainstay of the country's economy – are set to take hold in November. While the EU has already taken steps to obstruct Trump's sanctions – including potential penalties against firms that enforce the American sanctions without permission of the European Commission – officials in Europe still fear that the US dominance of the world financial system will block most business with Iran. Tehran itself has warned the Europeans that they should develop new ways of trading with Iran by early November if they want to preserve the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The US wants all businesses and countries around the world to stop doing business with Iran. News of the EU plan comes only two days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker vowed in his final State of the Union address to increase the role of the euro in international trade, particularly in terms of energy purchases. Word of the European plan to prop up Iran's oil industry is certain to further damage the already badly-strained transatlantic relationship. European governments have rarely acted so decisively in opposition to American foreign policy. Their action is partly motivated by what is viewed as an American attack on European sovereignty. Trump's government is seen as coercing compliance rather than working out agreed policy. A determined effort to get around US sanctions would also encourage European businesses to stay the course in Iran. Reuters, politico.eu and handelsblatt.com contributed to this story.

Later a spokesperson for the German finance ministry also confirmed the European plan to legislate a special purpose financial vehicle, according to German news outlet Spiegel. The EU special purpose financial vehicle will keep the cash inside the economic bloc and away from US-controlled global money-transfer networks, including SWIFT, while also avoiding the use of any bank afraid of being locked out of doing business with US financial markets. READ MORE: US Lawmakers Urge Treasury Dept. to Cut Off Iran From SWIFT — Letter "The German government is working together with the EEAS and European Commission, as well as France and the United Kingdom, on maintaining financial payment channels with Iran," the spokesperson noted, adding, "The negotiations on this are intensive and ongoing. There are different models under consideration," cited by Politico. Russia Ready to Join Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, commenting on the recent statements, has expressed Moscow’s readiness to cooperate within some kind of euro-SWIFT system to process operations among European banks and financial institutions, including oil and other resources payments. «We are ready to join such offers. That’s why it seems to me that this would be a way-out and response to these restrictions the US is imposing on companies and financial institutions, using dollars for settlements,” he told the Russian broadcaster Rossiya 24. The Brussels-based international interbank payment system SWIFT, created in the 70s, is now used by nearly 11,000 organizations in more than 200 countries. Criticized for sharing some information with the US government following the 9/11 attacks, the system in 2014 stated that it’s been put under pressure by some countries, insisting on its joining the sanctions against Russia. In the wake of Western sanctions over the Ukrainian crisis and threats to cut Russia off from the SWIFT in 2014, the Russian Central Bank created its own network, known as the System for the Transfer of Financial Messages, to be activated in the event that Russia's access to SWIFT is cut off. Earlier this year, a source told Russian media that Russia’s SWIFT alternative would also be upgraded to use blockchain technology by 2019.

News article:
Europe considers to facilitate financial transactions with Iran IRNA – European Union Foreign Affairs and Security Affairs Commissioner Federica Mogherini, says Europe has considered important solutions to facilitate bank and monetary transactions during the US sanctions against Iran, European Council on Foreign Relations website wrote. The website said, ‘As part of the effort to salvage the Iran nuclear deal, European governments have vowed to maintain their economic ties – not least their banking connections – with Iran. As of November 4, the US sanctions targeting Iran’s banks will make it extremely difficult for the European companies to engage in transactions with firms in the country. Many of the pathways to reduce the secondary impact of the US secondary sanctions on the European financial sector present significant technical and political challenges, however, Europe is determined to take preventive measures to enable European banks to operate with Iran.’ One of these is the creation of a legal entity to accomplish certain tasks. Establishing this mechanism is to facilitate payments to Iran. The special mechanism will allow European companies to continue their work with Iran in accordance with European laws. Europe wants to show its ability to fulfill its obligations, with the initiative of a special mechanism. The United States reacted to this mechanism and declared that we will not allow Europe or others to oppose the US sanctions. Although the European Union has shown its determination to support the continuation of cooperation with Iran, the special mechanism will be one of the important steps, but there are significant challenges to this framework of cooperation. If the United States imposes a new law and boycotts those involved in this plan, then not only efforts to circumvent the sanctions be disrupted in this way, but in some cases like medicines and foodstuffs that are exempted from sanctions, active people will also be included in the US sanctions. Hence, there are some doubts still about the effectiveness of the mechanism. The unilateral withdrawal of the United States from Iran’s nuclear deal and the Group 5+1, is contrary to the requirements of countries to adhere to international agreements. Therefore, the Europeans need to adhere to commitment to continue to cooperate with Tehran, in contrast to Trump’s decision to withdraw and impose sanctions on Iran. They have announced that they will adhere to with JCPOA and support the activities of their companies in Iran. The European Union will also provide a package of support for the activities of its companies in Iran.

News article:
Tehran, Iran, Oct. 19 Trend: European Union Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini said the block has decided to put its plan aimed at creating a payment channel to preserve business with Iran and circumvent new US sanctions in place. “This is something that we presented during the [United Nations] General Assembly ministerial week in New York. The Member States of the European Union have decided to put this system in place, so they are now working on the concrete establishment of this [payment channel]. I am confident that they will continue this work in a successful manner in the coming weeks,” Mogherini said on Thursday evening, the EU official website reported on October 19. Following a ministerial meeting on September 24 in New York, the participants welcomed an EU initiative to establish a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to facilitate payments related to Iran’s exports (including oil) and imports. “I have to say that our partners from Asia have always shown a lot of interest in working to keep the full implementation of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action); obviously for security reasons that also concern Asia and Central Asia,” she added. “But we tend to forget that Iran is not only a Middle Eastern country; it is also a country that have long borders with Afghanistan for instance, and that has many interests and links with Asia. I have always very much seen the interest and also exactly the same position that we have with our Asian partners on the need to maintain the JCPOA and on the need for Iran to stick to the full compliance to the nuclear commitments taken,” the EU foreign policy chief said. Back in May, US President Donald Trump pulled his country out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), despite objections from other signatories of the accord. In August, Washington re-imposed the first round of anti-Iran sanctions it had lifted under the JCPOA. A second round, forthcoming on November 4, will be targeting Iran's energy sector and financial transactions.

Open for business: Iran-EU finalizing deal to evade Trump trade sanctions Breitbart News | Simon Kent: Negotiations between Iran and the E.U. aimed at establishing a special payments channel to evade President Donald Trump’s renewed trade sanctions against Tehran are well underway, Iranian deputy Minister of Petroleum, Amir Hossein Zamaninia confirmed. In an interview with ISNA news agency released on Wednesday, Zamaninia said, “Iran and E.U. are negotiating. Expert-level negotiations between Iran and E.U. (Germany, UK and France) on establishing special payments channel are underway”. “We hope the special payments channel would be established before November 4,” he added. Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the original Obama-era trade deal in May. Shortly afterwards, his administration reimposed sanctions on Iran, which left other signatories to the pact scrambling to avoid punitive measures for dealing with Tehran. Mr. Trump declared the landmark 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or Iran nuclear deal, had been “horrible,” leaving the Iranian government with excess cash to contribute to conflicts across the Middle East. Within days of his original announcement, he observed that even the threat of new sanctions had already worked: Donald J. Trump ✔@realDonaldTrump Iran, and it’s economy, is going very bad, and fast! I will meet, or not meet, it doesn’t matter – it is up to them! 85.9K 33.9K people are talking about this Last month E.U. foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the countries were keen to finalize the technical details to defy the U.S. “In practical terms, this will mean that E.U. member states will set up a legal entity to facilitate legitimate financial transactions with Iran and this will allow European companies to continue to trade with Iran in accordance with European Union law and could be open to other partners in the world,” she told reporters while standing alongside Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. She said that the remaining members of the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia — would also maintain their commitments to support Iran on civilian nuclear energy. “The participants recalled that these initiatives are aimed at preserving the JCPOA, which is in the international interest,” she said. A number of business including French energy giant Total and carmakers Peugeot and Renault as well as Germany’s Siemens and Daimler have already suspended operations in Iran for fear of triggering U.S. sanctions.

Iranian MP says EU office in Tehran still viable Tasnim – An Iranian lawmaker said the European Union’s request for opening an office in Tehran could be granted if Europeans provide practical economic support for Iran in the face of US sanctions. Speaking to Tasnim, Chairman of the Iranian Parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy Commission Heshamtollah Falahatpisheh said the conditions are set for the EU to open a long-awaited office in Iran provided that they launch economic cooperation with Iran in practice. “Today, Europeans are standing with Iran in the political arena, and if such backing results in cooperation in the economic sphere as well, I believe that the conditions are set for the opening of the EU office in our country in the current situation,” he explained. Hailing Europe’s political confrontation with the US in support of Iran, Falahatpisheh said the EU office would be opened if Europe alleviates Iran’s concerns in practice. The EU proposed opening an office in Iran a couple of years ago. In 2016, Iran’s Foreign Ministry played down expectations for the establishment of the EU office in Iran, saying there was no “precise and comprehensive view” on opening such an office. In November 2017, Iranian First Vice-President Eshaq Jahangiri said the establishment of an EU office in Tehran was on the agenda of the Foreign Ministry, adding that the office could facilitate the implementation of bilateral agreements.

News article:
Cairo: Dozens of Iran-allied Al Houthi militiamen were killed in fierce clashes with the Yemeni government forces near the port city of Hodeida, military sources said Thursday. The fighting south of the Red Sea city raged for more than 10 hours during which different types of weapons were used, the sources added. Warplanes from a Saudi-led coalition fighting Al Houthis also bombed militia targets. The battles were fought west of the city’s airport, which the government retook months ago as part of a major offensive aimed at expelling Al Houthis from Hodeida in west Yemen. Clashes, meanwhile, erupted between pro-government forces, known as Giants Brigades, and Al Houthi miliamen east of Hodeida. The fighting broke out after the rebels attempted to reopen a main supply route linking Hodeida to the capital Sana’a being under Al Houthis’ control, the Giants Brigades’ media centre reported. During the fight, coalition jets destroyed a number of rebel positions in the area. “Al Houthis’ defeat is inevitable and imminent,” governor of Hodeida Al Hassan Al Taher said. He urged Hodeida locals, fighting on the side of the extremists to “return to the right path” and side with the government forces. Hodeida is strategically important because of its harbour, which is a lifeline for millions of Yemenis, as most of the commercial imports and relief supplies enter through it to the country. The coalition accuses Al Houthis of taking advantage of their control of the port to obtain weapons from their Iranian patrons as well as confiscate aid intended for Yemenis in order to sustain their war efforts. In recent weeks, government forces, supported by the coalition’s air power, have intensified their bombardment of Al Houthi rebels in and around Hodeida, which has been under the militants’ control since October 2014. The coalition has sent reinforcements to Yemen’s west coast ahead of a fresh assault on Hodeida, AP reported, citing Yemeni officials. They said that the reinforcements arrived Wednesday in tanks and armoured vehicles provided by the UAE, a key member of the coalition. UN envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths has been trying to bring the country’s warring sides to negotiations in order to revive a long-stalled peace process. The British diplomat has disclosed that he plans a new round of peace talks in Europe before the end of the year. He said in remarks to Al Arabiya that the planned talks could be held in Geneva or Vienna next month. Indirect talks, brokered by the UN in Geneva, collapsed last month after rebels failed to show up.

News article:
Alistair Burt, the British foreign office minister for the Middle East, has warned that efforts to stabilise Yemen are being complicated by the deliberate inclusion of "insurgents and terrorists" on lists of public sector salaries. Efforts to pay civil servants and other government employees is a top priority for mediators and humanitarian organisations seeking to increase money in the economy and stave off food shortages and the country's descent into near starvation. Donor countries have sought to provide funds to both the Yemen government and the Houthi-run ministries in Sanaa so that public servants can draw salaries. "There is a new and added complication in speaking to the UN over the weekend – not everybody on the list is necessarily all they seem. "There are those on the lists who may be insurgents and who may be terrorists and nobody is going to hand over taxpayers money to just pay salaries to these people. This is a new complication done by those who seek to abuse these lists." Mr Burt also dismissed suggestions that a UN Security Council resolution should be passed that demands a ceasefire in the Yemen conflict. Speaking to parliament, Mr Burt said he was guided by the need to provide maximum support for the efforts of Martin Griffiths, the UN Secretary General's special envoy, who is attempting to restart negotiations with the Houthi rebels. "The best way to use the United Nations Security Council is to support the role of UN special envoy Martin Griffiths," he said. "We don't want to do anything to undercut it. "If you want to see an end to the conflict you will support Martin Griffiths and his efforts." Mr Burt said Mr Griffiths, who was meeting the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday, continued to work to build confidence among the warring parties for negotiations after the failure of an attempt to kick start a new round of talks in Geneva in September. _________ Read more: Saudi ambassador to Yemen oversees fuel aid delivery to Aden Houthi rebels seize fuel and food cargo entering port city of Hodeidah Yemeni government launches cholera immunisation drive _________ Mr Burt said that the Houthi leadership had been responsible for the failure of the Geneva initiative. He said the summit between the government of Yemen and its Houthi-led rivals was "thwarted by the Houthi" who refused to go the negotiations. Attempts to blame logistic hurdles and the lack of humanitarian or medical evacuations were not credible. "If they had wanted to be there, they would have gone," the long-serving minister said. He added Houthis were responsible for abuse of humanitarian aid, systematic recruitment of child soldiers, interference with cholera fight and campaigns of targeted assassination. It was a view echoed by Jan Egeland, the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council and a former deputy to Kofi Annan as special envoy to Syria. He said the diplomatic failure was comparable to the lack of outside pressure on the Assad regime in 2012. "Martin Griffiths is doing everything that can be done as a special envoy. He did everything right until Geneva but there was not enough pressure on the parties from the outside world. To me it echos the situation with Kofi Annan and the parties in Syria in 2012," Mr Egeland warned. "There wasn't enough pressure on these irresponsible parties." The British parliament also heard a call from Marwa Baabbad, a researcher with the Oxford Research Group, for pressure on Iran to take responsibility for the Houthi groups it arms and funds. "There is a perception among some Yemenis that the UN Special Envoy is not holding the Houthis accountable enough," she said. "The UK government should pressure Iran to stop arming the Houthis and hold them responsible for their attacks on their population."

News article:
COPENHAGEN: Sweden on Wednesday offered to host talks between Yemen’s warring parties as Washington called for an urgent halt to hostilities and the UN special envoy ramped up efforts to revive discussions that failed nearly two months ago. Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said the United Nations has asked her country if it “could be a place for the UN envoy to gather the parties in this conflict” — the internationally recognized government, supported by a Saudi-led coalition, and Yemen’s Iran-backed Shiite rebels known as Houthis. Wallstrom told Swedish news agency TT that her country would be “happy about it,” but that nothing is definite. The possible venue comes as UN envoy Martin Griffiths called on the opposing sides in the 3 1/2-year conflict to heed “recent calls” for a quick resumption of the political process and efforts to win a halt to fighting in Yemen. The Trump administration late Tuesday called for an urgent halt to the war and a start to negotiations aimed at a political settlement. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asked all parties to support Griffiths in what Pompeo said must be “substantive consultations” in November in a third country. In separate remarks, also Tuesday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called for a cease-fire within 30 days. Nigel Tricks of the Norwegian Refugee Council welcomed the cease-fire call, saying it could be “the political breakthrough that we have long requested from parties to this brutal war” that has been “four years of hell for Yemeni women, men and children.” Griffiths urged the concerned parties to “seize this opportunity” and singled out support for “confidence-building measures” such as Yemen’s central bank, a prisoner exchange and the re-opening of the airport in the rebel-held Yemeni capital, Sanaa. “Dialogue remains the only path to reach an inclusive agreement,” Griffiths said in a statement. Wallstrom reiterated Sweden’s support for Griffiths, whose efforts to host talks between the government and rebels in Geneva in September ran aground when Houthi representatives didn’t show up, insisting they had not been guaranteed safe return after the discussions. The conflict in Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, began with the 2014 takeover of Sanaa by the Houthis who toppled the internationally recognized government. A Saudi-led coalition allied with the government has been fighting the Houthis since 2015. The war has killed over 10,000 people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine. The UN says Yemen is facing the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. At the beginning of 2017, the UN and its partners provided aid to 3 million hungry Yemenis. Since then, assistance has been scaled up, reaching 8 million people last month because of generous funding from donors, but far below the 14 million people — or half Yemen’s population — who may need it. Earlier this month, Mark Lowcock, the UN humanitarian chief, warned of “an imminent and great big famine engulfing Yemen.”

News article:
A leading Yemeni rebel figure on Thursday described the Trump administration's calls for a cease-fire in his country as "positive" but urged more international action to stop deadly airstrikes by the rebels' adversary, a U.S.-backed Saudi-led coalition. The comments by Mohamed Ali al-Houthi on al-Masirah TV network, which backs Yemen's Shiite rebels known as Houthis, followed U.S. demands for a truce and the launch of U.N.-led political talks to end the Saudi-Iran proxy war, now in its fourth year. According to al-Houthi, the chief of the rebel Supreme Revolutionary Committee, those urging a cease-fire should "translate their desire to bring peace in Yemen into action, stop the bombing of Yemenis immediately and lift the siege on Yemen." On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced what amounted to a major shift in the U.S. stance on the conflict, calling for a "cessation of hostilities." U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the truce should happen within 30 days and lead to U.N.-led political talks. The renewed diplomatic drive reflected a convergence of political pressures on Saudi Arabia stemming from international outrage over the slaying of a U.S.-based Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, and the humanitarian crisis that has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine. The Saudi-led coalition has been stepping up an assault on the Red Sea port of Hodeida, the entry point for 70 percent of food imports and international aid to Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country. The coalition has waged war on the Houthis since March 2015 in efforts to bring back to power Yemen's internationally recognized government, which was toppled by the rebels after they seized the capital, Sanaa, in 2014. The Saudi-led coalition sees the rebels' ascendance as interference by Shiite powerhouse Iran, the kingdom's key rival. The Houthis, who control most of northern Yemen, accuse the coalition of killing thousands of Yemeni civilians in a relentless air campaign and of choking Hodeida. In his remarks to the rebel TV, al-Houthi demanded the formation of international commissions of inquiry to investigate "crimes" of what the rebels describe as "U.S.-Saudi aggression." "It is necessary to stopping the war and the acts aggression, first of all, from the aggressor states which are supported by the United States of America," said Sultan al-Samaey, a member of the Houthi's Political Council. Bu the U.S. proposal was greeted with skepticism in the Houthi-controlled Sanaa. Al-Samaey said that while the war needed to be brought to an end, the rebels would only support "a peace which will preserve our independence." "This is simply a solution that will only plant land mines in the future of this region," said Ayoub al-Tamimi, a Sanaa resident and political activist. "There is no solution that can come from (President Donald) Trump or the Democrats, only booby traps." The International Committee for the Red Cross said Wednesday that its team in Hodeida this week found dreadful living conditions for thousands of displaced families "who own only the clothes they wear and survive on a little rice or a thin mix of flour and water, if they find any food to eat at all." "We know this is out of humanitarian hands, we know this is a political issue," Avril Patterson, the ICRC's health coordinator in Yemen said in an interview with the BBC on Thursday. "We need cessation of hostilities so that the country can rebuild." The conflict in Yemen has so far killed an estimated 10,000 people and also left around two-thirds of Yemen's population of 27 million relying on aid, with more than 8 million at risk of starvation.

News article:
CAIRO/ADEN (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said it attacked Sanaa International Airport and an adjoining airbase being used by Houthi insurgents, as the two warring sides also clashed further west in the country’s main port city. The violence broke out days after renewed U.S. calls for a ceasefire in the three-and-half-year war that the Saudi-backed government suggested it was ready to support. Houthi forces were using the airbase in the capital to launch drone and ballistic missile attacks, a coalition spokesman told Saudi state al-Ekhbaria TV on Friday. Flights and international aid efforts were not affected, Colonel Turki al-Malki said. Al-Masirah TV, which is controlled by the Houthis, said more than 30 air strikes targeted al-Dulaimi Air Base in Sanaa and the surrounding areas. In the port of Hodeidah, fighting broke out early on Friday in a southern district, residents and military sources said. The coalition had massed thousands of troops near the city on Wednesday, in a move to pressure the Iran-aligned Houthis to return to U.N.-sponsored peace talks. The sources in Hodeidah said fighting was heard in areas near the airport and the university, and Apache helicopters were spotted in the sky. Forces loyal to the Saudi-backed government have said coalition strikes were intensified on Thursday night on Houthi bases near the eastern entrance to the port city, which is a gateway to the capital, and in its southern part. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Sunni Muslim allies have been fighting since March 2015 against the Houthis, who drove the country’s internationally recognized government into exile in 2014. The Houthis control much of north Yemen, including the capital Sanaa. The war has devastated the country’s infrastructure and driven much of its population to the brink of famine.

Arab coalition jet fighters bomb Yemen capital city IRNA - Islamic Republic News Agency Tehran, Nov 2, IRNA -- The jet fighters of the Saudi-led Arab coalition bombarded the Yemeni capital city of Sana'a 30 times early Friday, Al-Masirah news network reported. Saudi warplanes also struck an air base and its surrounding areas, north of Sana'a ten times, according to Al-Masirah . The Saudi-led Arab coalition has intensified its air strikes against Yemen Thursday evening and Friday morning while the United States called for an end to Yemen war Wednesday evening. Top American officials called for a ceasefire in Yemen and demanded warring parties immediately come to the negotiating table. The comments came as the Saudi-Emirati-led military coalition deployed more than 10,000 new troops towards a vital port city in the run-up to a new assault. James Mattis, the Pentagon chief, said the US had been watching the conflict 'for long enough', adding he believes Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - who are in a US-backed coalition fighting Houthi rebels--are ready for talks. Meanwhile, spokesman for Yemen's Ansarallah Movement Mohammad Abduslsalam said if the United States was really serious in ending conflicts in Yemen it should first stop its arms sale as well as logistical and intelligence assistance to the Saudi-led coalition. Saudi Arabia and a number of its regional allies launched a devastating military campaign against Yemen in March 2015, with the aim of bringing the government of former president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi back to power and crushing the country's Houthi Ansarullah movement. Some 16,000 Yemenis have been killed and thousands more injured since the onset of the Saudi-led aggression. 1396**1396 NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
An Istanbul conference under the aegis of Nobel laureate Tawakkol Karman on Friday called for concrete measures to end the war in her native Yemen and an international court to judge those charged with crimes during the conflict, AFP reported. The conference was organized by Karman’s foundation. It urged international players, including the UN, to take “deliberate and responsible actions to end the war and restore peace in Yemen.” The UN special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, said in late October it aims to re-launch Yemen peace talks “within a month.” Karman, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011, was a key figure in the protests that ousted Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh during the Arab Spring uprisings. At the conference, Karman called on Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to end their “unconstructive interference in Yemen and stop supporting terrorist groups and armed militias.” She also called for an end to interference “by the mullahs in Iran to try to control Yemen by supporting Houthi militias.”

News article:
Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print By Staff Writer The Iran-backed Houthi militias have committed “heinous crimes” against the Yemeni people, according to the militant group’s former propaganda chief who defected on Friday. Abdelsalem Jaber, a self-styled information minister for the Houthis, explained during a press conference in Riyadh on Sunday that it is the right time for allied forces to complete the “liberation” of Yemen from the Houthis before detailing a long list of abuses carried out by Iran’s militia, including turning state institutions into competing “centres of power”. Jaber, the most senior member of the Houthi militia to switch allegiance to the internationally recognised Yemeni government since the war began in 2014, said that “detainees in Houthi prisons are being treated inhumanely” among other horrendous abuses. Jaber said that the Yemeni people reject “the foreign domination of the country”, i.e. Iran’s control over the Houthis, and that the “Yemeni people have rejected Houthi injustices and are waiting for an opportunity to get rid of them”, meaning that the US-backed Saudi-led Arab alliance will soon be able to bring democracy back to Yemen. Moammer al-Iryani, the information minister of the Yemeni government confirmed on Saturday that Jaber and his family fled the capital Sanaa for Saudi Arabia. His defection comes amid ongoing clashes between the Yemeni government forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis backed by Iran over the strategic Red Sea port city of Hodeidah. Reportedly, fighting has flared up in Hodeidah’s east with one government official stating that “the battles here are turning into street fighting”. On Saturday, government forces regained control of the May 22 Hospital during the offensive. Human rights watchdog Amnesty International accused the Houthis of “deliberate militarization” of the hospital after they deployed snipers on its roof. Terrorist Designation? Meanwhile, the Trump administration is contemplating designating the Iran-backed Houthis as a terrorist organization, which would increase pressure of the group to conform to acceptable behavioural standards. This is part of a wider effort by the White House to crack down on Iranian activities that are destabilising the region. Del Wilder, a counterterrorism specialist, said: “Everyone knows they are terrorists and that they’re controlled by Iran, which itself is a ‘terrorist organization’, but until there is regime change in Iran the Houthis, Hezbollah, Hamas, and others will continue to go about the business of committing acts of terror and disruption.” And let’s make no mistake, the Houthis are tied to Iran, as even spokesman Mohamed Abdel Salam, has acknowledged.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print By Staff Writer The Iran-backed Houthi militias have committed “heinous crimes” against the Yemeni people, according to the militant group’s former propaganda chief who defected on Friday. Abdelsalem Jaber, a self-styled information minister for the Houthis, explained during a press conference in Riyadh on Sunday that it is the right time for allied forces to complete the “liberation” of Yemen from the Houthis before detailing a long list of abuses carried out by Iran’s militia, including turning state institutions into competing “centres of power”. Jaber, the most senior member of the Houthi militia to switch allegiance to the internationally recognised Yemeni government since the war began in 2014, said that “detainees in Houthi prisons are being treated inhumanely” among other horrendous abuses. Jaber said that the Yemeni people reject “the foreign domination of the country”, i.e. Iran’s control over the Houthis, and that the “Yemeni people have rejected Houthi injustices and are waiting for an opportunity to get rid of them”, meaning that the US-backed Saudi-led Arab alliance will soon be able to bring democracy back to Yemen. Moammer al-Iryani, the information minister of the Yemeni government confirmed on Saturday that Jaber and his family fled the capital Sanaa for Saudi Arabia. His defection comes amid ongoing clashes between the Yemeni government forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis backed by Iran over the strategic Red Sea port city of Hodeidah. Reportedly, fighting has flared up in Hodeidah’s east with one government official stating that “the battles here are turning into street fighting”. On Saturday, government forces regained control of the May 22 Hospital during the offensive. Human rights watchdog Amnesty International accused the Houthis of “deliberate militarization” of the hospital after they deployed snipers on its roof. Terrorist Designation? Meanwhile, the Trump administration is contemplating designating the Iran-backed Houthis as a terrorist organization, which would increase pressure of the group to conform to acceptable behavioural standards. This is part of a wider effort by the White House to crack down on Iranian activities that are destabilising the region. Del Wilder, a counterterrorism specialist, said: “Everyone knows they are terrorists and that they’re controlled by Iran, which itself is a ‘terrorist organization’, but until there is regime change in Iran the Houthis, Hezbollah, Hamas, and others will continue to go about the business of committing acts of terror and disruption.” And let’s make no mistake, the Houthis are tied to Iran, as even spokesman Mohamed Abdel Salam, has acknowledged.

News article:
Riyadh - Abdel Hadi Al Habtoor The Yemeni Congregation for reform, known as Al Islah Party, supported all Arab Coalition efforts for ending the Iran-backed Houthi insurgency in Yemen during meetings with UAE officials in Abu Dhabi. Yemeni discussions being held in the UAE are an extension of a series of peace efforts launched by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in Riyadh. Al Islah media official Adnan Al Adini said “Saudi sponsorship has culminated with UAE officials summoning Al Islah leadership in a positive step meant to back the internationally-recognized government in its efforts to restore control over state institutions in Yemen and defeat the Houthi-led coup.” Speaking to Asharq Al Awsat, Al Adini said that Al Islah’s foreign policy initiatives are part and parcel of widespread efforts to shore up the freely elected government in Yemen. Al Adini stressed that the party was never opposed to UAE efforts for restoring peace to war-torn Yemen, criticizing a campaign of fake news falsely citing Al Islah objection to UAE leadership efforts in Yemen. “We hope our UAE fellows are presented with a clear view of what Al Islah party is, and not like what others say,” he said. While Al Adini praised UAE and Saudi efforts for producing peace in Yemen, he condemned Qatar for its role in compromising not only, Yemen’s security but regional and Arab stability as well. “Qatar played a bad role in supporting the Houthis, especially after having already fought them as a former member state of the Arab Coalition, is self-destructive behavior, “ Al Adini said while explaining that Qatari leadership fully understands that Iran’s agenda in Yemen threatens both Arab and Gulf security. Al Adini confirmed that Iran’s agenda for regional “sabotage” includes Qatar, despite Doha propping Iran proxy militias. “The Gulf diplomatic crisis, which we hope gets resolved, does not justify Qatar’s role in supporting Houthi putschists, especially when it understands Houthi’s involvement in the Iranian agenda which, apart from Yemen, threatens the whole region,” Al Adini said. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain have imposed a near-total embargo on Qatar since June 2017 over allegations of Doha supporting radical groups and seeking closer ties with Tehran.

The UAE, Saudi, US and UK established on Thursday a committee to address Yemen’s economic and humanitarian crisis. Senior officials and ambassadors of the quartet states met in Riyadh to identify measures aimed at stabilizing Yemen’s economy by calling on the international community to support the ongoing peace process. “The four nations agreed to establish an advisory committee that will meet once a month to establish measures aimed at stabilizing Yemen’s currency, management of foreign currency flows and support the government of Yemen in improving its economic management,” according to a statement by the Saudi Press Agency. They expressed support for UN Envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths’ efforts in bringing all sides of the conflict to the negotiating table in order to work on a political solution. Mr Griffiths is expected to give a briefing on Friday to the UN Security Council on the progress of the upcoming peace talks next month. Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Adel Al Jubeir, said on Thursday that the kingdom supports UN-led peace efforts to end the war in Yemen. "We support a peaceful solution in Yemen and we support the efforts of the UN special envoy to Yemen," Mr Al Jubeir told reporters. "We are committed to delivering all the necessary humanitarian aid to our brothers in Yemen." The development comes as Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, held talks with Yemen’s Al Islah party. During the meeting on Wednesday evening, Sheikh Mohammed reviewed the latest developments in Yemen with Al Islah chairman Colonel Mohammed Abdullah Al Yidoumi and secretary-general Abdulwahab Ahmad Al Anisi, according to state news agency WAM. _______________ Read more: Exclusive: Yemenia to resume flights to Arabian Gulf and Africa as it plans comeback Houthi rebels fire missile at Hodeidah port, threatening ceasefire _______________ Al Islah leaders expressed their gratitude to the UAE and the Arab led coalition for their efforts against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, according to WAM. “The meeting is seen as a positive and important step towards strengthening and uniting the Arab coalition in achieving its objectives of assisting pro-government forces to retake much of the rebel-held areas,” Adnan Al Adaini, deputy head of the information department of the Islah Party said. Mr Al Adaini accused Qatar of playing a role in undermining security in Yemen and the Arab region. Al Islah has been fighting alongside forces loyal to Yemeni president Abdrabu Mansur Hadi in Marib province, east of Sanaa, for three years. Mr Hadi on Wednesday backed UN-proposed talks to end fighting in his war-torn country but vowed to "liberate" the battleground rebel-held port city of Hodeidah regardless of the peace process. His aide Abdullah Al Alimi said the president had given strict instructions to army commanders to avoid civilian casualties, while also pushing for peace negotiations. President Hadi, said Mr Al Alimi, has continuously pushed for the interest of the country to be taken into consideration. On Thursday in Hodeidah an uneasy calm had settled for the third consecutive day after nearly two weeks of intense fighting between Iran-backed Hputhi rebels and the Arab coalition. A resident of Hodeidah told The National that the Iran-backed rebels had deployed tens of children to replace deserters and fighters taken prisoners by the coalition. Anas Balgheith, a displaced Hodeidah resident in Al Khoukhah told The National that tens of new Houthi fighters had been deployed to the city centre on a daily basis. "As soon as they arrive they take up positions on the buildings' rooftops and start digging new trenches and build barricades and plant mines," Mr Balgheith said. "More than 300,000 civilians are still living in the city, they are living in a catastrophic situation, they can't flee the city because the Houthis used to fire randomly over the families who tried to flee so the majority prefer to stay home.

News article:
A member of the Yemeni pro-government forces is pictured in front of the May 22 Hospital on the eastern outskirts of port city of Hodeida, on Thursday (AFP photo) UNITED NATIONS — United Nations food chief David Beasley spotted a tiny foot sticking out from under a blanket in a hospital in Yemen that has been overwhelmed with malnourished children, so he tried to bring a smile to the face of the small patient. “It was just like tickling a ghost,” Beasley, executive director of the World Food Programme, told reporters in New York on Friday after returning from a three-day visit to the war-torn, impoverished Arabian Peninsula country. Beasley recounted a conversation he had with a doctor at the hospital in the country’s capital Sanaa: “He said ‘every day about 50 children are brought to us. We have to send 30 home to die. We can only accommodate 20.’” Beasley will brief the UN Security Council on Friday with UN aid chief Mark Lowcock and UN Yemen Envoy Martin Griffiths, who is trying to broker peace in the more than three-year conflict seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Iran-allied Houthi group. The Houthis now rule most of Yemen’s population, while the exiled government controls a section of the south. The country’s economy is in crisis and three-quarters of Yemen’s population, or 22 million people, require aid. Some 8.4 million are on the brink of starvation, though Lowcock has warned that will likely rise to 14 million. “This is not on the brink of a catastrophe. This is a catastrophe,” Beasley said. “You cannot solve the humanitarian crisis in Yemen today with humanitarian response alone. It’s now going to require an economic infusion of substantial liquidity. Both are going to be required to avert a famine,” he said. Yemen’s riyal has lost more than half its value against the US dollar since the start of the war. Soaring prices have put some basic commodities out of reach for many Yemenis and the central bank has struggled to pay public-sector salaries on which many depend as foreign exchange reserves dwindle. Beasley also visited Yemen’s main port city Hodeida, which handles 80 per cent of the country’s food imports and aid supplies. The Saudi-led coalition has ordered a halt in a log-running offensive against the Houthis in Hodeida, sources said on Thursday. “That port has got to protected at all costs,” Beasley said. “We are prepared, if necessary, if all parties desire, for the UN to take over the operational capacity of the port. We are prepared to do that, we do not want to do that, but if that’s what it takes we will do it,” he said. Beasley also spoke about seeing an eight-month-old baby boy at the hospital in Sanaa who weighed a third of what he should. His mother had driven hundreds of kilometres through military checkpoints to get him medical help. “The little boy died yesterday,” he said. Containing the crisis Kuwait said this month there was a “positive view to contain the Gulf crisis”, and a source familiar with US policy said diplomats were putting forward a plan on Qatar. But neither side seems ready to cede ground. Qatar’s foreign ministry spokeswoman said last month that Khashoggi’s death should serve as a “wake-up call”. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said on Tuesday he did not expect a thaw soon. “I am very pessimistic about this. With the current [Saudi and UAE] leadership I don’t see that there is any way that things may be loosened up,” he told reporters. “The only face-saving way for them to get out is to apologise.” Abu Dhabi says the dispute is not a priority, according to three diplomats and other sources familiar with Gulf policy. “The Qataris are raising the price for resolving the crisis,” said one Western diplomat. “The Emiratis are happy to keep the Qataris isolated.” Qatar and UAE authorities did not respond to requests for comment. Riyadh and Abu Dhabi continue to reassure Washington that the dispute will not deter the formation of a proposed Middle East security alliance, which would include Doha, diplomats said. They said the UAE still strongly supports Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman against Iran and on his economic and social reforms, seen by Abu Dhabi as essential to replicating the UAE model of a business-friendly, tolerant Muslim society to combat extremism. “The Emiratis see Saudi Arabia as the only choice to lead the region. They haven’t blinked in their belief that Riyadh’s reform plans are the best and only option,” said Elizabeth Dickinson, senior analyst for the Arabian Peninsula at the International Crisis Group.

News article:
On September 19, a group of Yemeni human rights activists and journalists met with Mr. Kamel Jendoubi, the head of the prominent experts tasked with investigating human rights violations in Yemen. The meeting was held on the sidelines of the 39th session of the UN human rights council in Geneva, and it aimed to discuss the council’s August report, which stirred wide controversy due to some mistakes in it and due to its ignoring of many of the violations which the Houthis are committing in Yemen. I was one of the participants in this special meeting, which Jendoubi began with presenting the methodology adopted in preparing the report and the difficulties that the team confronted while visiting some areas that witnessed violations, as well as the obstacles which prevented the team from reaching other areas. The most significant thing that Jendoubi told us that day was that due to security threats, his team was prevented from reaching the Taiz governorate and other areas where the Houthis committed violations. Such organizations clearly support the Houthis. Yemenis on social media networks and in their gatherings wonder why does this always repeat as every time the Yemeni national army gets close to liberating any governorate, international organizations rush from day one to issue statements warning of the dangerous humanitarian situation Hamdan Alaly During the peak of the conversation, my friend Mansour al-Shadadi – a human rights activist from Marib – asked Jendoubi: “Why didn’t you visit Marib governorate to look into the crimes which the Houthis are committing there? It’s a secure city and the Houthis had bombarded it with missiles.” Jendoubi replied saying his team was prevented from entering it due to the security situation there. Advertisement I told him that the American envoy and other ambassadors and journalists from European countries continuously visit it, and it’s safe. Jendoubi interrupted me saying: “This is the envoy of America, a superpower,” to which I replied: “And you represent the UN!” The conversation ended with him saying: “The UN’s safety and security team is the one that prevented (our) team from reaching these governorates for security reasons and (we) cannot violate this.” Hence the UN report lacked the most important, brutal and dark side of the Houthis’ violations. UN contradictions On the same day, I met with Yemen's Deputy Human Rights Minister Nabil Abdul Hafiz and condemned the government’s lack of action – represented in its human rights and interior ministries – to secure the team’s visit to Taiz and Marib to look into the violations which the Houthis are committing there. Abdul Hafiz confirmed to me that the ministry repeatedly asked the team, both in written and oral requests, to go to Taiz and Marib and guaranteed it full protection but these demands were rejected. This is also what Yemen’s Minister of Human Rights Mohammed Askar confirmed to me later. OPINION: How Houthi criminal violations are ‘covered up’ in Yemen I recalled these details while reading news that a high-level delegation from international organizations, including UN organizations, risked itself to enter Hodeidah last Tuesday as armed confrontations were ongoing in different areas in and around the city. A delegation headed by Executive Director of the World Food Program David Beasley (who runs operations in more than 90 countries), UN Humanitarian Coordinator Lise Grande and others risked their lives and entered Hodeidah as they heard the gunfire, explosions and the roar of guns and fighter jets! The aim was to suspend the operations to liberate Hodeidah and save the Houthi armed militias, which the UN views in its decisions as rebellious. Before this huge contradiction, what can we the Yemenis understand? Such organizations clearly support the Houthis. Yemenis on social media networks and in their gatherings wonder why does this always repeat as every time the Yemeni national army gets close to liberating any governorate, international organizations rush from day one to issue statements warning of the dangerous humanitarian situation for the purpose of halting the liberation of these governorates?! These organizations keep silent when the Houthi militias commit violations against civilians. Hypocrisy It’s worth remembering that these international organizations kept silent when the heavily armed Houthis marched towards Sanaa and the rest of the governorates and they were even silent when the Houthis besieged Taiz and did not allow bringing in water, food and medicine resulting in the death of premature infants in hospitals because they lacked life-saving oxygen! Everyone still remembers what happened on January 22, 2016 when the United Nations Department of Safety and Security risked the lives of seven of the UN organizations’ chiefs, including the former humanitarian coordinator, to enter Taiz and issue a shameful statement announcing there was no humanitarian siege on the city. After three and a half years, none of these organizations can today issue a statement or a report acknowledging there is a humanitarian siege on Taiz. ALSO READ: When Israel kills Palestinians with impunity, why a ‘death penalty’ law? The same applies to non-UN organizations. What makes a British “charity” organization that practices political activities and carries out funded and supported media campaigns in Europe and the US demand changing or amending UN Security Council Resolution 2216 which obligates the Houthis to hand over their weapons towards guaranteeing restoring the state and ending the war? There is a huge amount of suspicious activities and shameful violations which some international organizations operating in Yemen are committing; hence confirming the political involvement and the scandalous exploitation of the humanitarian situation to obstruct any military efforts that seek to restore the state and liberate Yemen from the violence of the descent that claims that God granted it the right to enslave and control the Yemeni people. The Yemenis now know your conspiracies and your harmonious efforts along with the orientations of some states that are keen on keeping the armed Houthi militia in the Arabian Peninsula to be a dagger in the Arabs’ waist… but this will be in vain! This article is also available in Arabic. ____________ Hamdan Alaly is a Yemeni writer and journalist.

News article:
Hunger and disease have killed 85,000 children under the age of five in Yemen since 2015, according to Save the Children. Its estimate coincides with a UN envoy's visit to Sanaa as the warring parties prepare for talks. Humanitarian organization Save the Children estimates 85,000 children under five years of age have died in Yemen since the war started, its representatives said. The group said its figures were based on historically verified mortality rates for untreated cases of Severe Acute Malnutrition or SAM. These show that up to 30 percent of under-5's die if their malnutrition is neglected. "For every child killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are starving to death and it's entirely preventable," said the charity's Yemen director Tamer Kirolos. "Children who die in this way suffer immensely as their vital organ functions slow down and eventually stop." Read more: Struggling to stay neutral in Sanaa The UN did not provide a malnutrition death toll in Yemen, but its officials say 300,000 under-5's are at risk of dying in what the UN considers the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Proxy war Last month, the UN's World Food Program warned that the proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran had already put 8 million — over half of Yemen's 14 million people — on the brink of famine. A database run by ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project) puts Yemen's losses since early 2016 at 57,000. A Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 in a bid to restore a government that had been ousted by ethnic Houthi rebels in 2014. The fighting is currenly focused on the main port city of Hodeida, a supply line for the Iran-aligned rebels on Yemen's western Red Sea coast. The Saudi-led blockade was tightened a year ago. Aid groups have warned that an all-out assault on the port city would endanger 80 percent of Yemen's humanitarian aid, including food imports. Shelling in Hodeida Hodeida has seen shelling by pro-government and Houthi militias in recent days after the rebels declared a halt to missile and drone attacks on the Saudi-led coalition that includes United Arab Emirates forces. Pro-government troops on Hodeida's outskirts Image: Getty Images/AFP Arriving in the capital, Sanaa, Wednesday,UN envoy Martin Griffiths said both sides had agreed to attend peace talks in Sweden "soon." After talks with rebel leader Abdel Malek al-Houthi, Griffiths was expected to travel on to Hodeida on Thursday. A draft resolution, cited by Reuters, calls for halting the fighting around Hodeida and other populated areas, ensuring the flow of commercial and humanitarian goods and a fast injection of foreign currency into Yemen's impoverished economy. A previous bid to launch UN-sponsored talks in September in Geneva collapsed when the Houthi rebels failed to show up. ipj,dj/msh (dpa, AP, Reuters)

News article:
Riyadh – Abdulhadi Habtor British Ambassador to Yemen Michael Aron accused the Iran-backed Houthi militias of hindering the delivery of food aid to the Yemeni people, which is aggravating the country’s humanitarian crisis. He did, however, hail the undeclared truce that was announced in Yemen, saying it will lay the foundation for the upcoming peace consultations that are scheduled for Sweden before the end of the month. Aron told Asharq Al-Awsat that United Nations Security Council resolution 2216 is the main basis for a solution and negotiations in Yemen. The draft resolution that was presented by the UK to the Security Council does not substitute resolution 2216. The draft tackles humanitarian aspects of the conflict, not political ones, he clarified. Asked about the preparations for the Stockholm talks and the extent of the Houthis’ commitment to attend them, Aron replied that UN special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, was leading a good team and that the upcoming consultations are very important for the country’s peace and stability. He believed that both sides of the conflict were serious in participating in the consultations, adding that London welcomes the Houthi announcement that they were ceasing ballistic missile and drone attacks. The Houthis claim that they are serious about peace, but it is important for them to translate this stance at the negotiations and on the ground, he remarked. The last round of consultations were held in Geneva in September. The Houthis did not attend the talks, making last-minute demands that doomed the consultations to failure. Asked about the repercussions should any of the concerned parties fail to attend the new round of consultations, Aron warmed that the international community’s reaction will be strong. He added, however, that he was optimistic that all sides involved will head to Sweden. Moreover, he cited the recent tour of the region by British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, saying it was successful because it led to an agreement over the evacuation of wounded Houthis so that they could receive medical treatment. This was one of the main issues that had hindered the militias’ participation in the Geneva talks and it has now been resolved, noted the ambassador. Hunt had held talks during his visit with Custodian the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riaydh. He also met with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi. The Saudi and Emirati officials expressed to Hunt their desire for peace and stability in Yemen, adding that they supported Griffiths’ mission, Aron told Asharq Al-Awsat. Turning to the unofficial ceasefire in Yemen, he said that the developments on the ground indicate that it was being upheld. The Arab coalition, though, does not appear too keen on the truce because it believes that it will ease the pressure off the Houthis. It believes that military pressure is important in pushing them towards heading to negotiations, he explained. Asked about Yemeni criticism against the international community, including Britain, that it only acts when the Houthis are being cornered, he replied that since the eruption of the crisis, London sought to issue resolution 2216, which condemns the militias. He added that London also recognizes the government of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and stands by the Arab coalition. He stressed that Houthi attacks and their occupation of Yemeni regions is a catastrophe. A political solution is necessary for the problem It is laughable for the Houthis to believe that Britain is their ally, Aron added. Furthermore, he condemned in the strongest terms ballistic missile and drone attacks against Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The use of Sanaa airport for these attacks is unacceptable. The facility should be used for civil, not military purposes. On Saudi efforts to support Yemen, he noted that Kingdom was its greatest financial backer. Addressing Hunt’s recent visit to Tehran, the ambassador said that London believes that Iran is part of the problem in Yemen and it hopes that it can instead be part of the solution. It would be better for the Iranians to withdraw from Yemen and leave the Yemeni parties to solve their problems themselves, he stressed.

News article:
* War has unleashed world's most urgent humanitarian crisis * Western countries pushing for ceasefire, peace talks * UN envoy arrives in Yemen to meet Houthi leaders * Hostilities ebb but no formal ceasefire yet (Adds remarks by ICRC official, MSF) By Aziz El Yaakoubi and Mohammed Ghobari DUBAI/ADEN, Nov 21 (Reuters) - An estimated 85,000 children under five may have died from extreme hunger in Yemen since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in the civil war in 2015, an aid agency said on Wednesday, as the U.N. special envoy arrived in Yemen to pursue peace talks. Western countries are pressing for a ceasefire and renewed peace efforts to end the disastrous conflict, which has unleashed the world's most urgent humanitarian crisis with 8.4 million people believed to be on the verge of starvation. Save the Children said that a conservative estimate based on U.N. data showed 84,700 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition may have died between April 2015 and October 2018, when a Western-backed Arab alliance has been battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement that holds the capital Sanaa. "We are horrified that some 85,000 children in Yemen may have died because of the consequences of extreme hunger since the war began. For every child killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are dying from hunger and disease and it's entirely preventable," it said in a statement. The last available figure from the United Nations for the death toll from the conflict, seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, was in 2016 and stood at more than 10,000. The world body has not provided figures for the death toll from malnutrition but warned last month that half the population, or some 14 million people, could soon be on the brink of famine and completely reliant on humanitarian aid. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it had no fatality figures but both malnutrition and fighting were taking a heavy toll on civilians. "What we see in all the different (health) centres and places that we are working in, it's a very catastrophic humanitarian situation, but not only malnutrition," Carlos Batallas, outgoing head of the ICRC delegation in Aden, told Reuters in Geneva. "One of the problems that we are seeing today is that vaccination has not been followed through, that you have pregnant women that have no pre-natal care, women that cannot deliver kids at hospitals or a health centre with nurses." The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), a database that tracks violence in Yemen, says around 57,000 people have been reported killed since the beginning of 2016. The Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 to restore the government that was ousted from Sanaa in 2014 by the Houthis, who control most population centres. Since seizing the southern port city of Aden in 2015, the Arab coalition has faced a military stalemate and has been focusing on wresting control of the main port city of Hodeidah to weaken the Houthis by cutting off their main supply line. NO CEASEFIRE YET So far there has been no halt to fighting in Hodeidah, despite an announcement by the coalition last week that it would stop military operations there. A few days later the Houthis announced a halt to missile and drone attacks on coalition leaders Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and their Yemeni allies. Intense fighting in the past two days has taken place in Hodeidah mostly at night, as each side tried to reinforce its positions during the de-escalation in hostilities. "Loud bangs, shelling and gunfire could be heard all over the city until dawn," a Hodeidah resident said on Wednesday. The medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said fighting was moving closer to a hospital where its staff operate. "Our staff can hear explosions and shootings occurring extremely close by every day around Al-Salakhana hospital," its operations manager for Yemen said in a statement. A pro-coalition Yemeni military source told Reuters on Monday that a ceasefire in Hodeidah would start only after the U.N. Security Council passes a British-drafted resolution on Yemen. Aid groups fear an all-out assault on the city, entry point for more than 80 percent of Yemen's food imports, would unleash famine. U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths arrived in Sanaa on Wednesday to meet with Houthi leaders to discuss convening peace talks in Sweden next month. The Houthis failed to show up to peace talks in September. Kuwait has offered to provide planes for the parties to ensure the participation of both sides in Stockholm. Griffiths faces a daunting challenge to overcome deep mistrust between all sides. A draft resolution, seen by Reuters, calls for a halt to fighting in Hodeidah, a stop to attacks on populated areas across Yemen and an end to attacks on countries in the region. It also calls for an unhindered flow of commercial and humanitarian goods, and a large, fast injection of foreign currency into the economy through the central bank. "We are hoping that these peace conversations in Sweden next month will provide a ceasefire, will provide confidence-building measures. That we will have more possibilities for humanitarian organisations and for the population to start to move, to start to regain a normal life," ICRC's Batallas said.

The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), a database that tracks violence in Yemen, says around 57,000 people have been reported killed since the beginning of 2016. The Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 to restore the government that was ousted from Sanaa in 2014 by the Houthis, who control most population centres. Since seizing the southern port city of Aden in 2015, the Arab coalition has faced a military stalemate and has been focusing on wresting control of the main port city of Hodeidah to weaken the Houthis by cutting off their main supply line. NO CEASEFIRE YET So far there has been no halt to fighting in Hodeidah, despite an announcement by the coalition last week that it would stop military operations there. A few days later the Houthis announced a halt to missile and drone attacks on coalition leaders Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and their Yemeni allies. Intense fighting in the past two days has taken place in Hodeidah mostly at night, as each side tried to reinforce its positions during the de-escalation in hostilities. "Loud bangs, shelling and gunfire could be heard all over the city until dawn," a Hodeidah resident said on Wednesday. The medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said fighting was moving closer to a hospital where its staff operate. "Our staff can hear explosions and shootings occurring extremely close by every day around Al-Salakhana hospital," its operations manager for Yemen said in a statement. A pro-coalition Yemeni military source told Reuters on Monday that a ceasefire in Hodeidah would start only after the U.N. Security Council passes a British-drafted resolution on Yemen. Aid groups fear an all-out assault on the city, entry point for more than 80 percent of Yemen's food imports, would unleash famine. U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths arrived in Sanaa on Wednesday to meet with Houthi leaders to discuss convening peace talks in Sweden next month. The Houthis failed to show up to peace talks in September. Kuwait has offered to provide planes for the parties to ensure the participation of both sides in Stockholm. Griffiths faces a daunting challenge to overcome deep mistrust between all sides. A draft resolution, seen by Reuters, calls for a halt to fighting in Hodeidah, a stop to attacks on populated areas across Yemen and an end to attacks on countries in the region. It also calls for an unhindered flow of commercial and humanitarian goods, and a large, fast injection of foreign currency into the economy through the central bank. "We are hoping that these peace conversations in Sweden next month will provide a ceasefire, will provide confidence-building measures. That we will have more possibilities for humanitarian organisations and for the population to start to move, to start to regain a normal life," ICRC's Batallas said.

* War has unleashed world's most urgent humanitarian crisis * Western countries pushing for ceasefire, peace talks * UN envoy arrives in Yemen to meet Houthi leaders * Hostilities ebb but no formal ceasefire yet (Adds remarks by ICRC official, MSF) By Aziz El Yaakoubi and Mohammed Ghobari DUBAI/ADEN, Nov 21 (Reuters) - An estimated 85,000 children under five may have died from extreme hunger in Yemen since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in the civil war in 2015, an aid agency said on Wednesday, as the U.N. special envoy arrived in Yemen to pursue peace talks. Western countries are pressing for a ceasefire and renewed peace efforts to end the disastrous conflict, which has unleashed the world's most urgent humanitarian crisis with 8.4 million people believed to be on the verge of starvation. Save the Children said that a conservative estimate based on U.N. data showed 84,700 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition may have died between April 2015 and October 2018, when a Western-backed Arab alliance has been battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement that holds the capital Sanaa. "We are horrified that some 85,000 children in Yemen may have died because of the consequences of extreme hunger since the war began. For every child killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are dying from hunger and disease and it's entirely preventable," it said in a statement. The last available figure from the United Nations for the death toll from the conflict, seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, was in 2016 and stood at more than 10,000. The world body has not provided figures for the death toll from malnutrition but warned last month that half the population, or some 14 million people, could soon be on the brink of famine and completely reliant on humanitarian aid. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it had no fatality figures but both malnutrition and fighting were taking a heavy toll on civilians. "What we see in all the different (health) centres and places that we are working in, it's a very catastrophic humanitarian situation, but not only malnutrition," Carlos Batallas, outgoing head of the ICRC delegation in Aden, told Reuters in Geneva. "One of the problems that we are seeing today is that vaccination has not been followed through, that you have pregnant women that have no pre-natal care, women that cannot deliver kids at hospitals or a health centre with nurses."

News article:
Nearly 85,000 children under the age of five have died from acute malnutrition in Yemen since the start of the conflict, an international NGO said on Wednesday, after humanitarian officials warned that the war-torn nation was heading towards the worst famine in history. The statement by UK-headquartered Save the Children came a day after Saudi Ambassador to Yemen Mohammed bin Saeed Al Jaber met the Head of the International Committee of the Red Cross for the GCC, Yahya Al Oleibi, to discuss co-operation over the humanitarian situation in Yemen, according to the Saudi Press Agency. Eight million Yemenis are currently affected by severe food shortages, according to UN officials, who warned that up to 14 million – or half of Yemen's population – are at risk of famine. Of that number, 1.8 million are children under five years old who are described as acutely malnourished. Another 400,000 are severely acutely malnourished, and yet another 1.1 million are malnourished pregnant or nursing women. “I saw children dying before my very own eyes,” the head of the UN World Food Programme, who visited Yemen last week, said in a televised interview with CNN. David Beasley said he tried to tickle the children expecting them to smile, but it felt instead “like tickling ghosts”. Aid organisations blame both Houthi rebels and the Saudi-led coalition for deteriorating humanitarian conditions in the country. Aid groups, including Save the Children, say not enough food is entering the country through Yemen's main port of Hodeidah. The rebel-held port, through which the country imported up to 90 per cent of its food before the war, has had a drop-off of commercial imports by more than 55,000 tonnes a month since the Saudi-led coalition imposed a blockade on the area a year ago, Save the Children said. This is only enough to meet the needs of 4.4 million people, including 2.2 million children, it said. Meanwhile, Mr Beasley said Houthi rebels were endangering humanitarian operations elsewhere in the country. The WFP chief accused the Iran-backed rebels of placing seven landmines inside grain bins in one of WFP’s grain silos in Hodeidah. He said his team found the landmines only two days after he had left Yemen. “They [Houthi rebels] have been entering our facilities, violating every humanitarian principle, putting our people, who are working there, putting their lives on the line,” he said. “This has got to stop.” The deputy governor of Hodeidah province, Waleed Al Qudaimi told The National that the Houthi militia was planting landmines and threatening food warehouses in an attempt to put pressure on relief organisations to providing food for the rebel group's fighters. He also claimed that rebels stole thousands of sacks of flour meant for families living in rebel-controlled parts of Hodeidah. Earlier on Tuesday, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates pledged $500 million (Dh1.8 billion) to tackle food shortages in Yemen. The new aid programme will provide food assistance to up to 12 million Yemenis. The UAE and Saudi Arabia are working with organisations on the ground to ensure aid and food assistance reaches the most vulnerable populations, Reem Al Hashimy, UAE Minister of State for International Co-operation, told a news conference. “We are focusing on the most affected groups, especially malnourished children, pregnant women and the elderly,” she told reporters. “We will ensure that humanitarian conditions improve.” Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, where 8.3 million people are dependent on food aid, according to the UN. The nearly three-year civil war has pushed the country to edge of famine with outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria. The Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 to push back the Houthi rebels and restore the government of President Abdrabu Mansur Hadi. The Houthi rebels, backed by the Iranian regime, have repeatedly launched ballistic missile towards Saudi. _______________ Read more: Editorial: The moment for peace in Yemen must be seized Arab Coalition throws its weight behind Yemen peace talks Unicef says 'every 10 minutes' a child is dying in Yemen

Iran hosting international conference on Yemen amid Saudi war Press TV – The International Conference on Supporting the Oppressed and Resistant Yemenis has kicked off in the Iranian capital, with dozens of intellectuals and civil rights activists from 35 countries in attendance. The event, which opened in Tehran on Thursday morning, is expected to highlight the sufferings of the Yemeni nation caused by a brutal Saudi-led war on the impoverished country. The one-day conference will also feature speeches by Iranian officials and several representatives from resistance movements in the region. Iran stands by war-stricken Yemenis Addressing the summit, the head of Iranian volunteer Basij forces said that Yemeni people’s resistance against the Saudi aggression will live on in history. Brigadier-General Gholam-Hossein Gheibparvar Iran, as a nation that has itself suffered from US mischief economic blockade, and war, understands the ordeals of the Yemeni people. Backed by the US and the UK, Saudi Arabia and a coalition of its vassal states unleashed the deadly military aggression against Yemen in March 2015 in an attempt to reinstall the country’s former Riyadh-allied regime. The Saudi-led offensive, coupled with a naval blockade, has destroyed Yemen’s infrastructure and led to famine in the import-dependent state. The military standoff has so far killed about 56,000 Yemeni people, the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a nonprofit conflict-research organization, said in a report last month. According to latest calculations by Save the Children, nearly 85,000 Yemeni children may have died of starvation amid the Saudi war Turning a deaf ear to international warnings, the Saudi-led military alliance has been engaged in a concerted push since June to seize Yemen’s port city of Hudaydah, a vital conduit and lifeline for aid delivery to Yemeni civilians. Yemeni armed forces, led by the Houthi Ansarullah movement, have put of stiff resistance in the face of the Saudi-led campaign with the help of popular forces, preventing Riyadh and its allies to achieve their goals of war. Referring to the remarkable the Yemeni forces have been showing in Hudaydah, Gheibparvar said, “What is taking place in Yemen is a lesson of withstanding. All [enemies] have gathered in Hudaydah, but people have been standing against them with empty hands.”

News article:
Riyadh – Abdulhadi Habtour The Yemeni Mothers of Abductees Association, a pressure group led by mothers, wives and daughters whose fathers, sons and husbands are imprisoned and tortured by Houthi militias in Sanaa, urged UN Special Envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths to step in and help free hundreds of journalists detained in coup prisons. A breaking story on four abducted journalists brutally tortured by Houthi militias in Sanaa, their stronghold, shocked Yemenis nationwide. A new round of peace consultations is scheduled for early December, whereby Griffiths and the freely-elected government will have a chance to negotiate the release of journalists and anti-Iran dissidents kidnapped by Houthis. The Association on Tuesday issued a statement revealed shocking details on the torture of journalists Salah Al Qaidi, Akram Al Walidi, Hareth Hamid and Issam Belghaith faced in Houthi prisons. According to the statement, the detainees were stripped from their clothes and left to freeze in icy weather for four hours, and received an inhuman beating that left them unconscious. Iran-supported Houthi militias, undeterred, have been actively abducting journalists for nearly four years in a way amounting to human rights crimes. “This requires the urgent action of all human rights organizations, human rights activists and media personnel to step in and save and end the suffering of thousands of abductees held in coup prisons,” the statement read. According to Reporters without Borders (RSF) Press freedom has been dramatically curtailed by major political upheavals and violence including the seizure of the capital, Sanaa, by Iran-allied Houthis. Journalists are now constantly exposed to threats, attacks, and abduction. As for access to information on the internet, many websites are blocked since the Houthis took control of the Ministry of Telecommunications. Citizen-journalists are under surveillance in all areas of Yemen and get arrested for posts on social media. Yemen is ranked 167th out of 180 countries in RSF's 2018 World Press Freedom Index. In one of the monitor’s reports, Houthis militias were found responsible for the death of 26 journalists and media professionals, between 2014 and 2017, and 825 violations of press freedoms. Documenting Houthi transgressions against press freedoms and the right to information, a 2017 UN report revealed that the Iran-backed group had also blocked 21 websites, 7 television channels and banned 18 newspapers.

News article:
UN’s Yemen envoy unlikely to deliver a miracle in Stockholm Mohamed Chebaro UN envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths. (AFP) After fruitless meetings in Sanaa, Muscat, Riyadh, Geneva and Kuwait, will the Yemen peace talks in Stockholm be any different? Despite a different UN special envoy to Yemen, and a new drive by the international community to settle the conflict, the talks in Sweden are unlikely to yield much. Martin Griffiths, the new UN envoy, will try his luck but the situation on the ground remains unchanged and therefore I doubt the Iran-aligned Houthis are in the mood to yield to power-sharing or to equal representation in a united and peaceful Yemen that will coexist and cooperate with its neighbors. Since the uprising in Yemen broke out in early 2011, the UN has been trying to help Yemenis find a peaceful solution. It supported negotiations between the government and the opposition, resulting in the signing of the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and its implementation mechanism in Riyadh in November 2011. Since then, four UN Security Council resolutions have been voted on, but none have made it as far as being acted on by the warring parties. Griffiths joined the fray after two previous UN envoys tried but failed to bridge the gap between the Houthi militia and the elected government of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, which is now in exile and supported by the Saudi-led Arab coalition. Encouraged by new international resolve, Griffiths hopes to revive the peace process that will ultimately lead to a negotiated transition and power-sharing based on UN Security Council Resolution 2216. In Stockholm, Griffiths hopes to present his updated version of the “Framework for Negotiations,” which it is hoped will help the warring parties agree on a road map that will lead to an end to the war and a transitional deal. The framework, we are told, will include interim security and political arrangements, and the return of Yemen’s friendly relations with neighboring states and the restoring of state institutions. Griffiths hopes to go beyond the mere normalization of Yemen, as he hopes that his framework will ideally lead to principled compromises that will allow the people of Yemen to live again in peace. What the new UN envoy has not explained are the guarantees, if any, that he has received from the Houthi militia and its patron Iran to facilitate such a deal. Military experts would ask, since the Houthis have not suffered great losses and still have a firm grip on power in all strategic provinces from Saada close to the Saudi border all the way to Taiz in the south, why would they suddenly have the appetite to concede and share power? As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to Congress, the issue of Yemen and other hotspots in the Middle East are directly linked to Iran Mohamed Chebaro Iran might be minded to show flexibility in Yemen after the noose of US sanctions was tightened again this month, but at what price? All indications point to a less compromising Tehran after the reimposition of US sanctions. From Afghanistan to Iraq and through to Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Gaza, Iran’s allies are not interested in compromising, sharing power, facilitating government formation, or the voting in of transition governments. Saudi Arabia, the party most affected by the Yemen conflict — as more than 200 ballistic missiles have been launched toward its southern provinces and even its capital Riyadh — has repeatedly expressed its willingness to seek a political settlement that protects Yemeni unity and stability in the Gulf region. There is now mounting pressure in the US for Washington to end its support for the Arab coalition in Yemen. By a bipartisan 63-37 vote, the Senate on Wednesday opted to move forward with legislation calling for an end to US involvement in Yemen, despite President Donald Trump’s opposition. But, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to Congress, the issue of Yemen and other hotspots in the Middle East are directly linked to Iran; and any drawdown by US lawmakers against Saudi Arabia would lead to a stronger Iran in the region. Griffiths insists that he has received assurance from the various Yemeni parties, including the Houthis and Hadi’s government, that they will attend the talks in Stockholm. But the real assurance that seems to be missing is the green light from Tehran, the Houthis’ main ally, about facilitating such a deal. The odds are that the negotiations will go ahead, but the secret potion to replace rivalry with peace is still elusive. The Yemen conflict is one flashpoint among many where Iran is meddling in its neighbors’ internal affairs and, unless a global approach is taken to accommodating Iran’s needs and interests with those of its neighboring states, peace talks will be a waste of time. The nuclear deal to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions, which was brokered by the Obama administration, could have been an occasion to review and redraw the limits of Iranian influence in the region. That opportunity has been missed, and the Yemen conflict is unlikely to trigger a process to clip Iran’s wings. Griffiths believes there is a genuine drive from all sides to join the forthcoming Stockholm consultations, but all indicators — short of a major shift in the theater of war — point to the fact it is unlikely all parties will be swayed to compromise — at least not yet.

* Evacuating wounded Houthis precondition to attend peace talks * US Senate to mull resolution to end support for Saudi-led war * Yemen conflict seen as proxy Saudi-Iranian war * Turning up for talks in Sweden seen as progress - analyst * More than 8 million Yemenis facing starvation (Adds Houthi official, UN envoy, British foreign minister) By Mohamed Ghobari and Aziz El Yaakoubi ADEN/DUBAI, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Yemeni Houthi officials are expected to travel to Sweden shortly for talks as early as Wednesday to end the nearly four-year-old war after the Saudi-led coalition allowed the evacuation of some of their wounded for treatment. Prospects for convening talks have risen as Western allies press Saudi Arabia, leader of the Sunni Muslim alliance battling the Iranian-aligned Houthis, over a war that has killed more than 10,000 people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine. U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths arrived in the Houthi-held capital Sanaa on Monday to escort the Houthi delegation, a U.N. source told Reuters. The Saudi-backed government has said it would follow the Houthis to the talks, the first since 2016. The peace talks may start on Wednesday, two sources familiar with the matter said. Griffiths shuttled between the parties to salvage a previous round that collapsed in September after the Houthis failed to show up. Western powers, which provide arms and intelligence to the coalition, may now have greater leverage to demand action on Yemen after outrage over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Riyadh's consulate in Istanbul led to increased scrutiny of the kingdom's activities in the region. The U.S. Senate is due to consider this week a resolution to end support for the conflict, seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and its arch-foe in the Middle East, Iran. Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a member of the Houthi politburo, told Reuters their delegation would travel to Sweden Tuesday morning on a plane provided by Kuwait and accompanied by Griffiths. A post on the U.N. envoy's Twitter account thanked all parties for facilitating the evacuation of the 50 wounded fighters on Monday to Oman for treatment. British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt tweeted that the evacuation as a "positive 1st step" ahead of the talks. The coalition said in a statement it had agreed on the evacuation "for humanitarian considerations and as part of confidence-building measures" ahead of the talks, which are also due to focus on a transitional governing body. The Iranian Foreign Ministry said it backed the talks and was ready to help find a political solution, Iranian state TV reported on Monday. LOOMING FAMINE Analysts said both parties showing up for the talks would be an achievement in itself, even if there are no concrete outcomes as Griffiths tries to overcome deep mistrust on all sides. "Neither side wishes to be blamed for the dire consequences of the looming famine, which is starting to become a reality," said Elisabeth Kendall, a senior research fellow in Arabic and Islamic Studies at Oxford University. "But it remains to be seen whether the political will is really there to make the necessary concessions for peace." Some 8.4 million Yemenis are facing starvation, although the United Nations has warned that will probably rise to 14 million. Three-quarters of impoverished Yemen's population, or 22 million people, require aid. The Arab alliance intervened in the war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognised government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi but has bogged down in military stalemate, despite superior air power, since seizing the southern port of Aden that year. The Houthis, who are more adept at guerrilla warfare, hold most population centres including Sanaa and the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah, a lifeline for millions that is now the focus of the war. Griffiths hopes to reach a deal on reopening Sanaa airport and securing a prisoner swap and a ceasefire in Hodeidah as a foundation for a wider ceasefire, which would include a halt to coalition air strikes that have killed thousands of civilians as well as Houthi missile attacks on Saudi cities.

The United Nations has evacuated 50 wounded Houthis to the Omani capital, Muscat for treatment, Anadolu Agency reported an aviation source as saying. The source who preferred not to be named said the UN-chartered plane carried 50 wounded Houthis as well as 50 of their respective escorts and a team of doctors. The Saudi-led Arab coalition announced on Monday morning that the UN will evacuate the 50 Houthi wounded militants for treatment in Oman. READ: Iran backs Yemen peace talks, state TV says Earlier in September, the Houthis refused to participate in the Geneva consultations after the Arab coalition declined to evacuate the wounded. The Yemeni government accused the Houthis of smuggling Iranian experts among the wounded, who had provided training and military expertise to Houthis in their fight against government forces.

Negotiators representing Yemen's internationally recognised government arrived in Sweden for UN-backed talks with Houthi rebels on Wednesday, marking the start of a new peace push that the government hopes will end a war that has brought economic ruin and famine to the country. A rebel delegation is already at the conference venue north of Stockholm, having arrived on Tuesday. Talks are scheduled to start on Thursday. The delegation representing the Yemeni government on Wednesday met with UN envoy Martin Griffiths' team. The envoy is scheduled to deliver a press conference on Thursday morning alongside Sweden's Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom. The tone from all sides appeared to be more positive than that during September's round of abortive talks in Geneva, which failed to even bring the Houthis to the table. If the warring parties meet, it would be the first time since 2016 that the team representing the internationally recognised Yemeni government would engage in UN-backed talks with Houthi rebels.

The British Ambassador to Yemen, Michael Aron, confirmed that the talks will take place on Thursday. “The delegation of the Yemeni government will reach today, and the talks will start tomorrow in Johannesbergs Castle,” Mr Aron said.

News article:
The Trump administration’s nominee for it's next ambassador to Sana’a said Washington has started to plan for post-conflict recovery efforts, as Yemen's warring parties arrive in Sweden for peace talks scheduled to launch on Thursday. Christopher Henzel, a foreign service diplomat who is nominated by US President Donald Trump for the role of Yemen ambassador, told Congress in his confirmation hearing on Tuesday that "there is no military solution to the conflict and it is a tragedy what's been happening in Yemen. The administration is working to end the hostilities.” Mr Henzel who currently serves as the charge d’affaires at the US Embassy in Riyadh, urged lawmakers to put more emphasis on the post-conflict situation if a peace agreement is reached. “Once a peace agreement is reached, experts project that there could be over one million former combatants in Yemen,” he said. “To prepare for this, the [US State] Department is planning long-term engagement on post-conflict Security Sector Reform and Disarmament, Demobilization, and Re-integration needs.” The nominee especially emphasized security cooperation between the Yemeni government and the Saudi-led coalition to help Yemeni security forces fight smuggling and terrorism. Despite heavy criticism from lawmakers about the US role in Yemen and its logistical support for the Saudi-led coalition, Mr Henzel said the US must prepare "to have a strong presence in a unified Yemen, despite future threats that may be posed by the efforts of rebuilding and unification.” He warned of the humanitarian and political ramifications of the Yemen war. “This protracted war has exacerbated the world’s largest food insecurity emergency and cholera epidemic, and created an economic crisis,” he said. Sounding the alarm, Mr Henzel saw the conflict as leading “to collapsed state institutions, local power vacuums and ungoverned spaces that the Houthis and terrorists have exploited to threaten important partners in the region, and has threatened US national security interests.” He also said the war has complicated “our ongoing counterterrorism efforts and has facilitated Iran’s ambitions, further threatening regional stability.” Mr Henzel criticized Iran’s role and its arming of the Houthis but saw a peace agreement with the Yemeni rebels as the only way forward. Speaking at the same hearing was General Kenneth McKenzie Jr., the administration’s nominee to lead the US Central Command. According to the Washington Post, Mr McKenzie told the Senate Armed Services Committee that American involvement in Yemen advances the goal of a peace deal between the Houthis and the Yemeni government. “I believe our ability to participate and drive those discussions requires that we remain in contact with both [the United Arab Emirates] and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” he was quoted as saying. The US Congress is due to vote next week on a bill that would end US role in the war. But in the interim, all eyes are on Stockholm where the US has consistently backed and pushed for the UN-led talks. In a statement on Tuesday, the State Department called on all parties “to engage fully and genuinely, and cease any ongoing hostilities.” “The people of Yemen have suffered far too long…the parties owe it to their fellow Yemenis to seize this opportunity” the statement read.

News article:
RIMBO: Yemen’s government and rebels, locked in a devastating war for years, traded mutual accusations Thursday as they sat down for hard-won talks the UN envoy described as a “critical opportunity”. The talks in Rimbo, Sweden — a picturesque village some 60 kilometres (35 miles) north of Stockholm — have been months in the making, the first time in two years warring parties sit down together in a nearly four-year war which has pushed the impoverished country to the brink of mass starvation. While the days leading up to the talks looked promising, with the Saudi-backed government and Huthi rebels agreeing on a prisoner swap deal and the evacuation of wounded insurgents for medical treatment in Oman, ties between the two sides were tense as the talks opened. Yemeni Foreign Minister Khaled al-Yamani, who heads the Saudi-backed government’s delegation to the UN-sponsored talks in Sweden, told AFP his team would follow through with a planned prisoner swap with the Huthi rebels — but refused to compromise on the flashpoint city of Hodeida, home to Yemen’s most valuable port. “The Huthi militias must withdraw from the city of Hodeida and its port and hand it over to the legitimate government, and specifically internal security forces,” Yamani said. Hamid Issam, a member of the team of Iran-backed Huthi rebels in Sweden, dismissed Yamani’s role in the talks altogether. “We came here with the intention that these talks would succeed,” Issam told AFP. “But it is not up to Khaled al-Yamani... It is up to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the United States.“If they could have taken Hodeida four years ago, they would have. They have not been able to take it, and they will not be able to take it as long as the people of Yemen are fighting.” Hodeida is on the agenda at the talks, slated to run for one week. Not on the table are negotiations on a solution to the conflict between the government of Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi, based in southern Yemen, and the northern Huthi rebels, according to UN envoy Martin Griffiths. A Saudi-backed military coalition, which includes troops trained by the US and UAE, has for months led an offensive to retake Hodeida, the last rebel stronghold on Yemen’s Red Sea coast and the conduit for 90 percent of vital food imports. The move has sparked fears for more than 150,000 civilians trapped in the city as even hospitals were seized by militants. Saudi Arabia and its allies accuse the rebels of smuggling arms from Iran through Hodeida, a charge Tehran denies. More than three years since Saudi Arabia and its allies joined President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi’s fight against the Huthis, Yemen is now home to what the UN calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with 14 million people facing imminent mass starvation amid war as a frail economy crumbles. Griffiths, who flew to Sanaa to personally escort the rebel delegation to Sweden, said he hoped for small but concrete measures. “During the coming days we will have a critical opportunity to give momentum to the peace process,” Griffiths told reporters as the rival delegations gathered in Sweden. “There is a way we can resolve the conflict,” Griffiths said, adding that the Security Council was “united” in its support for a resolution to the conflict. “Remember these are consultations. We are not yet beginning the process of negotiations.”Griffiths said the UN was willing to step in in Hodeida, an offer the Saudi-led coalition has rejected unless the rebels withdraw completely from Yemen’s western coastline.

News article:
The UN said future talks between Houthi rebels and Yemen's government will try to find a political solution to the conflict, as a government delegate said his team was willing to discuss rebel participation in the Cabinet if the insurgents gave up their guns. Yemen’s warring parties continued consultations in Sweden in the first meeting between the two sides since a breakdown of 2016 talks. A UN official who spoke on condition of anonymity on Sunday said Yemen’s factions would meet again in early 2019.

The UN said future talks between Houthi rebels and Yemen's government will try to find a political solution to the conflict, as a government delegate said his team was willing to discuss rebel participation in the Cabinet if the insurgents gave up their guns. Yemen’s warring parties continued consultations in Sweden in the first meeting between the two sides since a breakdown of 2016 talks. A UN official who spoke on condition of anonymity on Sunday said Yemen’s factions would meet again in early 2019. The talks in Sweden have so far side-stepped discussions on a political transition, focusing instead on a prisoner swap, the reopening of Sanaa airport and securing UN administration of the strategic Red Sea port of Hodeidah. “Whatever gains we get here (in Sweden) as an entry point to the solution of the conflict, we could start towards building a political solution in late January,” the UN source said. “We want the war to end and we want that to happen now,” he said. _______________ Read more: Yemen's warring parties still at odds over key agenda items as talks enter third day Exclusive: Mesa to include nine countries while prioritising Iran threat [ Senate agrees to debate US Role in Yemen war ] _______________ The UN official said the two sides were willing to meet but had yet to agree on a date and venue.

News article:
On Nov. 5, the United States imposed sanctions on Iran's oil exports, the central bank of Iran and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. Despite being the "toughest sanctions ever placed," their efficiency will depend on Europe, as it is Iran's second-largest trading partner. It is so because the biggest trading companion – China (30 billion euros annually), used to conduct business with the republic under the sanctions regime. Formally the European Union supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). In August, after the first round of U.S. sanctions against Iran's automotive industry, riyal and trading in gold and some metals, Brussels promised to compensate losses for firms and prohibited them from complying with U.S. restrictions. Later on Nov. 2, the EU vowed a special payment mechanism which allows European companies to continue oil trading with Iran by bypassing the U.S. dollar. Still there are some tendencies inside Europe that make its resistance incomplete. Foremost, its fear. In an interview with CBS, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reminded viewers that "hundreds of businesses have left Iran since [President Donald] Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal." Among them are French Total S.A., which inked a $1 billion deal to develop the South Pars offshore field, Peugeot and Siemens. Pompeo hopes to increase fear and enforce more European multinationals to cut commerce with Tehran. "Any European companies doing business there won't do business with the U.S.," he added. The second barrier for effectiveness of European anti-sanction mechanism is the lack of unity concerning Iran. Some of the EU member states are more loyal to Washington than others. A recent example is Denmark. On Oct. 30, the Danish foreign ministry recalled its ambassador to Iran and announced that it would seek EU sanctions against Tehran. The reason was the attack by a Norwegian citizen of Iranian origin on the activist of the Arab Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz (ASMLA) – an organization that seeks to separate Khuzestan, the oil-rich province in the Persian Gulf, from Iran. Copenhagen believes Teheran was behind the assault. Given the possible involvement of ASMLA in the September terror attacks in the town of Ahwaz, the operations of Iranian special services may seem justified. However, such Iranian crackdown on the separatists is estimated by some EU countries as a violation of human rights and crime on the European soil. Iran risks getting its "Skripal case," which became an appropriate pretext to unite almost every member state around British anti-Russian initiatives and forced even the U.S. to impose sanctions against Russia. Thus, Danish accusations may destroy the pan-European consensus concerning avoiding the U.S. sanctions against Iran and non-imposition of its own. Such attempts emanated not only from loyal U.S. allies, such as Denmark, which gave full backing to Washington's war in Afghanistan and Iraq. In June, a wave of anti-Iranian sentiment was launched in France, which accused Tehran in attempt to launch a bombing attack on a demonstration in Paris with the participation of the Iranian opposition. For its own part, the White House will warm up the European fears. In May, after Trump denounced the JCPOA, Pompeo accused Iran's Revolutionary Guard of carrying out "assassination operations in the heart of Europe." Now he says to the Europeans – either work with the U.S. or with Iran. After signing the nuclear deal, the EU's trade with Iran has tripled from 7 billion to 21 billion euros. Dozens of EU companies – including Total, Eni and BASF – signed multibillion contracts to develop Iran's infrastructure, gas fields and construction sector. Whether or not Brussels withstands the U.S. pressure on Iran, will define not only the future of European revenues and energy security, but also its readiness to be independent from the United States. * Political scientist, specialist on the Middle East, Turkey, Russia and the EU; Ph.D. degree (Dr. Phil.) from Salzburg University

News article:
Iran almost managed to carry out some of its threats against Europe in recent weeks, but it learned its lesson the hard way and discovered that its agents operating in the West have been exposed. Two attempts to attack Iranian dissidents were foiled. One was in France against the People's Mujahedeen of Iran conference; the other was in Denmark against Ahwazi activists. While the security agencies in several European capitals believe that Tehran will not stop such efforts, Paris did not think it necessary to do more than expel an Iranian diplomat. What's more, there was no special media focus on the incident. The authorities in Copenhagen, meanwhile, urged EU countries to support the demand for economic sanctions against Iran. Will this mean more sanctions to join those imposed by the US? Iran's action against dissidents who challenge its security must put relations with "friendly" countries at risk. If Tehran doesn't understand that, it is misjudging the situation. READ: Europe's central banks to open channel for Iran In the French and Danish cases, it was confirmed that efforts to save the nuclear agreement were not connected to the thwarting of the two terrorist attacks. Perhaps the fact that Iranian citizens were targeted meant that the situation did not escalate. According to The Economist, the Europeans are interested in maintaining the nuclear agreement with Iran because it should delay Tehran's acquisition of a nuclear weapon. If the deal is discarded, Iran may resume uranium enrichment in secret locations that weapons inspectors cannot get to and the capacity to build a nuclear bomb may result. This is a situation that Europe does not want to think about, as they fear that it would open the door to worse prospects, most notably armed conflict. The Europeans welcome Donald Trump's invitation to Iran to negotiate but consider his demand for a new agreement imposed by force through the use of new sanctions to be unrealistic in its objective of convincing the government in Tehran to agree to talks. The US is relying on the impact of the sanctions to bring the Iranians to the table, but the EU is stepping up its efforts to establish a plan to overcome or ease them. Over a year after the US pulled out of the nuclear deal, Europe's rejection of such a move has not changed, although the dispute with America may be costly. The Iranians believe that pressure on Europe could push the US President to back down, or they could play on the difference between the Western allies. The irony is that Tehran has gone so far as to make threats, with Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, the Commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and his deputy, Hossein Salami, have hinted since November last year that the range of Iran's missiles could be increased to over 2,000 km. They clearly meant to let the EU know that Europe could be targeted "if it posed a threat to Iran." The Iranian Atomic Energy Organisation also used threatening language against Europe just days after the US pulled out of the deal in May, warning of the consequences if the EU reneges on the terms of the agreement. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei outlined a list of requirements from Europe's commitment to the deal and said that it would be considered null and void if they are not fulfilled. In September, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif threatened that his country might curb its implementation of the agreement and increase its work on uranium enrichment if Europe does not compensate Iran for the consequences of the US sanctions. He added that Europe must be ready to pay for its security. Such threats apparently did not frighten the Europeans. However, it is surprising that they did not reject them or respond in any other way. Instead, their dealings with Iran since have been intended to appease and reassure Tehran, to no apparent avail. Iran may be able to resume its nuclear programme, but not now, as it needs time to regain its former momentum. It is, however, using this card to put pressure on Europe, which wants to preserve its economic interests but is reluctant to be seen to be giving in to any blackmail. This has strengthened Tehran, which is using the Europeans in its confrontation with Washington. READ: Europe must offset US pullout from nuclear deal It may have succeeded in part with the idea of forcing Europe to "compensate" Iran for its losses as a result of the US sanctions. There is an international precedent for this; the Obama administration compensated Israel for not taking action against the nuclear deal. The whole game will be revealed soon because any European measures will be limited and formal and will not constitute worthy "compensation". Furthermore, Iran has not accompanied its threats with any genuine offers that would help Europe to argue to the US that Tehran intends to change its behaviour. What's more, the Danish Prime Minister has insisted that maintaining the nuclear agreement is not a blank cheque to cover up unacceptable Iranian actions on European soil. Denmark's leader made this statement in the context of a call to punish Iran for the foiled attacks against its dissidents.

News article:
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union foreign ministers showed cautious support on Monday for possible new economic sanctions on Iran in a shift of policy after accusations of Iranian attack plots in France and Denmark, diplomats said. Denmark and France briefed their EU counterparts at a meeting in Brussels on the alleged plots and ministers agreed to consider targeted sanctions on Iranians in response, although no details or names were discussed, five diplomats told Reuters. Though still at an early stage, the EU’s readiness to penalize Iranians would be the first such move in years after months of internal division over how to punish Iranians accused of destabilizing activities in Europe and the Middle East. Until now, the EU has been straining to uphold the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and world powers that U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of in May. It has been less willing to consider sanctions, instead seeking talks with Tehran. Iran has warned it could ditch the nuclear deal if EU powers do not protect its trade and financial benefits. France has already imposed sanctions on two Iranians and Iran’s intelligence service over what it says was a failed plot to carry out a bomb attack at a rally near Paris organized by an exiled Iranian opposition group. One option is to establish those asset freezes at an EU-wide level, diplomats said. Denmark, which in October said it suspected an Iranian government intelligence service had tried to carry out an assassination plot on its soil, is also open to EU-wide sanctions, the diplomats told Reuters. In October, France said there was no doubt that Iran’s intelligence ministry was behind the June plot to attack the demonstration by Iranian exiles near Paris. It froze assets belonging to Tehran’s intelligence services and two Iranian nationals - a Vienna-based diplomat now under arrest in Belgium for the plot and the deputy minister and director general of intelligence, Saeid Hashemi Moghadam. Neither appear to have held any assets in France. Paris also discreetly expelled an Iranian diplomat, diplomatic sources told Reuters last month. Iran has denied any involvement in either alleged plot. Under the 2015 deal, Iran restricted its disputed nuclear program, widely seen in the West as a disguised effort to develop the means to make atomic bombs, in exchange for an end to international sanctions against it. MISSILE SANCTIONS DIDN’T FLY In March, Britain, France and Germany proposed to sanction Iran over its development of ballistic missiles and its role in Syria’s war, but the initiative failed to gather sufficient support across the EU to take effect. Italy was one EU country unwilling to countenance new measures as it sought to preserve business ties with Iran. In an effort to balance Iran policy, the ministers at their meeting on Monday also tried to press ahead in setting up a special mechanism to trade with Iran that could be under EU, not national, law. The Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is a kind of clearing house that could be used to help match Iranian oil and gas exports against purchases of EU goods in an effective barter arrangement circumventing U.S. sanctions, which are based on global use of the dollar for oil sales. Despite technical difficulties and delays, the EU believes this formula could shield individual member states from being hit by U.S. sanctions that have been reimposed on trade with Iran after Washington’s pullout from the nuclear deal. “There is a willingness for the financial vehicle ... to be set up quickly,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters. However, no country has come forward as a potential host. Their reluctance arises from fears that SPV reliance on local banks to smooth trade with Iran may incur U.S. penalties, severing the lenders’ access to U.S. markets, diplomats said. Luxembourg is seen as a good candidate to manage the Iran SPV given its experience in creating a similar mechanism during the 2009-12 euro zone financial crisis.

News article:
The European initiative known as the “special purpose vehicle” aiming to facilitate financial transactions between the Green Continent and Iran’s regime – read bypass US sanctions – is very shaky and unstable. What at first seemed to be a bold rising to the challenge by the European Union has now suffered major and controversial setbacks following a series of foiled, Iran-orchestrated terror plots on European soil, including Albania, France and Denmark. These developments have made EU/Iran political relations all the more complicated, to say the least. Advertisement Logically, Iran would need to tone down its foreign bellicosity to allow Brussels present an argument vis-à-vis Washington. However, Tehran’s need to save face back home against its opposition in exile, the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI / MEK), leaves it no choice but to launch such illogical measures from a diplomatic relations point of view. That being a broad subject for another day, this piece will provide another perspective into why this EU/Iran initiative will most certainly end in failure. Harsh reality While introduced a few months ago, the special purpose vehicle (SPV) dossier is facing a conglomerate of obstacles and hurdles. Experts are now asking does this mechanism actually intend to provide the Europeans the means to purchase Iran’s oil and gas while bypassing the ongoing buildup of US primary and secondary sanctions. “So far, her ‘vehicle’ is stuck in bureaucratic mud, unable to take off as European firms leave Iran in droves,” as described by Benny Avni in a New York Post piece in reference to EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini as the SPV architect. Even media outlets known for promoting a return to the Obama era of US/Iran engagement are voicing growing concerns about the SPV sailing into unknown waters. “Officials have said they are watching such engineering attempts closely, although few economists and officials in Europe believe such efforts will offer Tehran much in the way of sanctuary from American penalties immediately,” according to the New York Times. Despite the brouhaha launched in western media by Iranian regime apologists and lobbyists, along with remnants of the Obama-era pro-appeasement voices, the on-the-ground reality strikes alarming reminders for those serious about doing business. “The European payment mechanism doesn’t shield you if you use the US financial system ... you can pay but don’t expect to be on their Christmas card list,” said Alex Beard, chief executive for oil and gas at Glencore, to Reuters. Eventually, tensions are rising between Tehran and Brussels, as the Iranian regime’s patience began to grow thin. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his deputy Abbas Araqchi have most recently voiced their disappointment in Europe not meeting their expectations to launch the SPV as a lifesaving mechanism against mounting US sanctions beginning to take their toll in crippling fashion. Finally, the nail in the coffin. “A special European Union initiative to protect trade with Iran against newly re-imposed US sanctions faces possible collapse with no EU country willing to host the operation for fear of provoking US punishment,” according to another recent Reuters report. “A bit crazy” Despite its noisy coming to life, the EU SPV gradually grew to become “little more than a glorified arrangement with limited scope” and even described as “largely symbolic.” More disturbing for businesses is the fact that the SPV, while aiming to become an alternative to the SWIFT global messaging system, falls miserably short. The SPV will lack the necessary ability to “conduct business in dollars or to access US institutions and the US financial system as a whole,” as explained Joel Gehrke in The Washington Examiner. Taking this slate of reservations into consideration and all the measures of various parties, the nuts and bolts of Europe’s SPV remains a mystery and even Mogherini failed to provide any actual timetable for its launch. Adding insult to injury for the EU and Iran is the reluctance shown by a variety of European countries to host the SPV, including Luxembourg, Austria and Belgium, leaving the entire project literally homeless. At the end of the day, Gordon Sondland, the US Ambassador to the EU, dismissed the planned SPV as “nothing more than a paper tiger.” In spite of its strong support of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, France has yet to make a firm decision regarding the SPV and minister recently told Le Monde the entire idea is “a bit crazy.” Disclaimer - This author is writing under a pseudonym to protect his identity.

News article:
The European initiative known as the “special purpose vehicle” aiming to facilitate financial transactions between the Green Continent and Iran’s regime – read bypass US sanctions – is very shaky and unstable. What at first seemed to be a bold rising to the challenge by the European Union has now suffered major and controversial setbacks following a series of foiled, Iran-orchestrated terror plots on European soil, including Albania, France and Denmark. These developments have made EU/Iran political relations all the more complicated, to say the least. Advertisement Logically, Iran would need to tone down its foreign bellicosity to allow Brussels present an argument vis-à-vis Washington. However, Tehran’s need to save face back home against its opposition in exile, the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI / MEK), leaves it no choice but to launch such illogical measures from a diplomatic relations point of view. That being a broad subject for another day, this piece will provide another perspective into why this EU/Iran initiative will most certainly end in failure. Harsh reality While introduced a few months ago, the special purpose vehicle (SPV) dossier is facing a conglomerate of obstacles and hurdles. Experts are now asking does this mechanism actually intend to provide the Europeans the means to purchase Iran’s oil and gas while bypassing the ongoing buildup of US primary and secondary sanctions. “So far, her ‘vehicle’ is stuck in bureaucratic mud, unable to take off as European firms leave Iran in droves,” as described by Benny Avni in a New York Post piece in reference to EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini as the SPV architect. Even media outlets known for promoting a return to the Obama era of US/Iran engagement are voicing growing concerns about the SPV sailing into unknown waters. “Officials have said they are watching such engineering attempts closely, although few economists and officials in Europe believe such efforts will offer Tehran much in the way of sanctuary from American penalties immediately,” according to the New York Times. Despite the brouhaha launched in western media by Iranian regime apologists and lobbyists, along with remnants of the Obama-era pro-appeasement voices, the on-the-ground reality strikes alarming reminders for those serious about doing business. “The European payment mechanism doesn’t shield you if you use the US financial system ... you can pay but don’t expect to be on their Christmas card list,” said Alex Beard, chief executive for oil and gas at Glencore, to Reuters. Eventually, tensions are rising between Tehran and Brussels, as the Iranian regime’s patience began to grow thin. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his deputy Abbas Araqchi have most recently voiced their disappointment in Europe not meeting their expectations to launch the SPV as a lifesaving mechanism against mounting US sanctions beginning to take their toll in crippling fashion. Finally, the nail in the coffin. “A special European Union initiative to protect trade with Iran against newly re-imposed US sanctions faces possible collapse with no EU country willing to host the operation for fear of provoking US punishment,” according to another recent Reuters report. “A bit crazy” Despite its noisy coming to life, the EU SPV gradually grew to become “little more than a glorified arrangement with limited scope” and even described as “largely symbolic.” More disturbing for businesses is the fact that the SPV, while aiming to become an alternative to the SWIFT global messaging system, falls miserably short. The SPV will lack the necessary ability to “conduct business in dollars or to access US institutions and the US financial system as a whole,” as explained Joel Gehrke in The Washington Examiner. Taking this slate of reservations into consideration and all the measures of various parties, the nuts and bolts of Europe’s SPV remains a mystery and even Mogherini failed to provide any actual timetable for its launch. Adding insult to injury for the EU and Iran is the reluctance shown by a variety of European countries to host the SPV, including Luxembourg, Austria and Belgium, leaving the entire project literally homeless. At the end of the day, Gordon Sondland, the US Ambassador to the EU, dismissed the planned SPV as “nothing more than a paper tiger.” In spite of its strong support of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, France has yet to make a firm decision regarding the SPV and minister recently told Le Monde the entire idea is “a bit crazy.” Disclaimer - This author is writing under a pseudonym to protect his identity.

Official hails growing trend in Iran’s exports to Iraq Tasnim – The secretary general of Iran-Iraq joint chamber of commerce highlighted an upward trend in the export of Iranian products to Iraq. In a meeting with Iranian and Iraqi trade delegations, Hamid Hosseini pointed to a growing trend in Iran’s exports to the Arab country, saying its daily value stands at $45 million and sometimes reaches $70 million. Noting that most of the oil and gas projects in Iraq are undertaken by European and Chinese contractors, he deplored that although Iranian companies have won the bidding to carry out such projects in Iraq, a series of problems have prevented them from starting the job in the Arab country. He was referring to the US sanctions on Iran and Washington’s pressures on Baghdad to stop doing business with Tehran. Iraq’s new Foreign Minister Mohamed Ali Alhakim has made it clear that his country cannot cut off trade ties with Iran under the US sanctions, saying the value of annual trade between Iran and Iraq amount to $12 billion.

Baku, Azerbaijan, Dec. 16 By Elnur Baghishov – Trend: Iran exports goods worth about $45 million a day and sometimes up to $70 million to Iraq, Hamid Hosseini, secretary-general of the Iran-Iraqi Chamber of Commerce, said. Iraqi companies were invited to work in oil and gas fields as contractors, Trend reports referring to Tasnim News Agency. Iranian companies are participating in tenders on behalf of Iraqi companies and this way participate in Iraq’s oil, gas and engineering projects, Hosseini added. The Iraqi companies do not have the necessary potential to implement those projects, he said. Iranian companies can join Iraqi projects through cooperation with them, Hosseini said. Presently, European and Chinese companies have most of oil and gas projects in Iraq, he said. Though Iranian companies won the tender, they were unable to operate in this country, Hosseini said. The agreements must be signed between the two countries in the field of export of agricultural products, Hosseini added. Iraqi officials would like these agreements to be signed, he said. But Iranian officials say that Iraqi officials have been invited to Iran, but they have not come, Hosseini said. It is necessary to pay attention to this issue. Iran wants to export its products, so it should take the first step, he added.

Baku, Azerbaijan, Dec. 30 By Elnur Baghishov – Trend: The products $2.222 billion were exported to Afghanistan during eight months of this Iranian year (started on March 21, 2018) compared to the same period of last Iranian year, Mohammad Mehdi Javanmard Qasab, head of Trade Promotion Organization of Iran's Afghanistan Desk, said. This figure increased by 26 percent in terms of value compared to the same period of last Iranian year, Qasab added, Trend reports referring to ILNA. During the reporting period, the goods worth $7.6 million were imported, which is 44 percent less compared to the same period of last Iranian year. Iran mainly imports sesame, agricultural products and marble from Afghanistan, he added. The export of Iranian goods to Afghanistan increased as a result of the activity of the representatives of the Iranian Trade and Development Organization, as well as the Iranian trade attachés in Afghanistan, he said. This growth has accelerated since 2011. Over the last few years, Afghan businessmen have been investing in Iran’s various economic sectors, namely, carpet weaving, food industry and hotel industry, Qasab said.

News article:
India has reportedly handed Iran a tax break worth hundreds of millions of dollars, effectively green-lighting a crude oil import deal that had thus far been hindered by sweeping US sanctions. India, one of among eight countries exempted from those sanctions for six months, has moved to pay for the oil in its currency, rupee, since the main banking channels dealing with global currencies are blocked by Washington’s measures. The $1.5 billion crude oil deal was signed on November 2 between India’s finance ministry and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), Reuters reported Monday, citing a government order. Such a payment to a foreign company operating in India would have normally been subject to a tax of 42.5 percent, or $637.5 million — a deal-breaker for the Iranians — according to the report. The exemption from that tax was signed by the Indian finance ministry on Friday and is backdated to November 5, the report said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The payment to NIOC will be in rupees — a currency that can’t be freely traded internationally — and will be used by Tehran to pay for imports from India, invest in Indian businesses and pay expenses of Iranian missions and students in India. “In the previous round of sanctions Iran was allowed to use funds for imports from India but this time we have expanded the scope for use of funds to benefit both nations,” an unnamed Indian government official was quoted by Reuters as saying. In November, US President Donald Trump’s administration reinstated all of Washington’s sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. Advertisement The sanctions were the second batch that the Trump administration has reimposed on the Islamic Republic since it withdrew from the nuclear agreement last year. The rollback ended US participation in the Obama-era accord, which now hangs in the balance as Iran no longer enjoys the billions of dollars in sanctions relief it was granted under the deal in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. Iran is already in the grip of an economic crisis. Its rial currency has plummeted and oil exports have steeply fallen, though India and China have continued to purchase it. Most Europeans, as well as Japan and South Korea, have stopped. Agencies contributed to this report

Iranian scholar: US had no way but to exempt Chabahar from sanctions IRNA – The fact that the US has exempted Iran’s port of Chabahar from the sanctions imposed against Iran indicates the significance of the port, its global impact and its benefits to the US, Netherlands Leiden University instructor said in Tehran on Wednesday. At a workshop regarding the Iranian southern port city of Chabahar and regional cooperation hosted by the Faculty of Law and Political Science at the University of Tehran, Mohammad Bagher Foroukh said Chabahar is Iran’s only oceanic port where giant ships can dock. In Iran’s foreign policy the focus is on political and security issues while geographic and economic capabilities of the country should also be taken into account, he went on to say. ‘The advances made by China and India, and the position Iran enjoys as the world’s crossroads has resulted in these countries and in particular India’s interest in Iran’s Chabahar port,’ he added. The Leiden University instructor said as a super power, the US is on the decline and China is emerging as a key power, adding regional countries such as Iran and Turkey cannot be ignored. Foroukh said internationalization requires transit routes and if Iran wants to become active internationally, it should pay more attention to the issue and Chabahar as Iran’s only oceanic port has considerable importance in this regard.

News article:
SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean oil buyer is set to receive about 2 million barrels of Iranian condensate in January, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday. The cargo marks the first Iranian oil import by South Korea in four months after the world’s fifth-largest oil buyer halted imports before the U.S. reimposed sanctions on Iran in November. The first cargo of about 960,000 barrels of condensate, a type of light crude oil typically produced in association with natural gas, is expected to arrive this week at the port of Incheon, said the source, who declined to be named due to sensitivity of the matter. The Silvia 1, a vessel carrying 955,000 barrels of Iranian oil, is set to arrive in South Korea on Jan. 15, trade flow data from Refinitv Eikon showed. A second cargo of 990,000 barrels will arrive later this month, the source said. In November, South Korea won a temporary waiver from the United States to purchase a limited amount of Iranian oil. The U.S. reimposed sanctions on Iran’s oil sector in November to pressure the country to end its nuclear programme and to curtail its support for Syria and militants in Yemen. South Korea can buy up to 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian oil under the sanctions waiver, mainly condensate, according to industry sources. South Korean oil buyers were expected to restart oil purchases from Iran in late January or early February, the head of SK Innovation, owner of South Korea’s top refiner SK Energy, told Reuters last week. South Korean buyers of Iranian crude and condensate include SK Energy and SK Incheon Petrochemical, owned by SK Innovation, Hyundai Oilbank Corp [INPTVH.UL] and Hanwha Total Petrochemical Co [SMCHE.UL].

Japan says it will continue oil purchase from Iran IRNA - Islamic Republic News Agency Tehran, Jan 21, IRNA -- Japanese refiner Fuji Oil was loaded with Iranian crude oil in the first cargo to head for the East Asian country since Tokyo received a waiver from the US sanctions on Tehran. Japan says it will continue purchasing Iranian oil as the crude 'plays an important role in the country's long-term plans'. 'We've had hard and complex negotiations with the US to buy oil from the Islamic Republic and finally the Japanese oil tanker berthed at Iran's ports,' Japanese Ambassador to Iran Mitsugu Saito was cited as saying by Iran's parliament website (ICANA). 'Japan will continue buying Iranian oil as it has an important role in our long-term plans,' added the Japanese envoy following a meeting with the Iranian lawmaker Kazem Jalali. Soito stressed that some Japanese companies are still in cooperation with the 'Islamic Republic' although some western countries abandoned Iran following restored unilateral US sanctions. Japanese and Iranian diplomatic relations date back to 90 years ago. 'We hope our bilateral cooperation would increase,' said the Japanese official. For his part, Jalali, who is head of the Parliament's Research Center, expressed the hope that long-standing ties between the two countries would lead to an increase in their economic cooperation. The Iranian parliamentarian said the US unilateral withdrawal from the 2015 international treaty with Iran on its nuclear programme, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), will harm all countries. 'If Japan and other world countries want to preserve the international laws and that other nations abide by their obligations, they need to resist against the US.' 9218**2050 NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

Japan's Iran oil loading to continue through March ISNA - Iranian Students' News Agency Sat / 26 January 2019 / 14:01 Tehran (ISNA) - Japanese refiners will continue to lift oil from Iran through March after receiving a waiver from U.S. sanctions on crude imports in November, Takashi Tsukioka, president of the Petroleum Association of Japan (PAJ) said. Japan resumed oil liftings from Iran this month after refiners Fuji Oil Co Ltd and Showa Shell Sekiyu KK loaded cargoes onto a tanker that is expected to arrive in Japan on Feb. 9, according to Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide. Japan's oil refining industry will continue to ask its government to seek an extension of the U.S. sanctions waivers after the initial 180-day exemption is over in May, he said Japanese refiners will likely be able to secure alternative supplies from other Middle Eastern countries, he added. Japan's Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd plans to buy the remainder of its contractual volumes of Iranian oil between February and March, said Tsukioka, who also serves as Idemitsu's chairman. Idemitsu is likely to renew its term contracts for Iranian oil although details have not been decided, he said. End Item NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

Iran confirms hosting Taliban delegation for peace talks Iran Press TV Mon Dec 31, 2018 11:34AM Iran says it has hosted a delegation from Taliban to discuss possible ways to end hostilities in Afghanistan. Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi told reporters in Tehran on Monday that the extensive meetings between Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and the group on Sunday were coordinated with the government of Afghanistan. "Since the Taliban are in control of more than 50 percent of Afghanistan, and given the insecurity, instability and other issues that the country is dealing with, they [the Taliban] were interested in talks with Iran," Qassemi said. He said Iran has long borders with Afghanistan and always sought a constructive role to maintain peace in the region. The Tehran meetings came days after it was confirmed that Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), had traveled to the war-torn country for initial talks. Most analysts believe that Iran's effort to get the Taliban to accept peace with the Afghan government is aimed at preventing further growth of Takfiri terrorist groups, especially Daesh, in the war-ravaged country. Following its defeat in Iraq and Syria, Daesh terrorists have been shifting attention to Afghanistan during past month, making the country a new center of their atrocious acts of terrorism in a bid to sow more insecurity across the whole region. About 18 years of the United States' presence in Afghanistan at the top of a military coalition has brought nothing but chaos and insecurity to the country as a result of which all forms of organized crime, especially production of illicit drugs, have been skyrocketing. The country has also turned into a hotbed of violent acts by major terror outfits, especially Daesh. US should leave Iraq, Syria Qassemi then pointed to Trump's recent trip to Iraq and his decision earlier this month to end the US military presence in Syria, saying Washington "should go back home." Trump's unexpected announcement was met with criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, prompting Defense Secretary James Mattis to resign. The decision also led Brett McGurk, the US special envoy to the so-called anti-Daesh coalition in Syria and Iraq, to quit. But Trump doubled down on his policy by also announcing that he would cut in half the roughly 14,000 US forces in Afghanistan. Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch ally of the US president, said Sunday that Trump had agreed to reevaluate the evacuation plan, meaning that the process was now in a "pause condition." Qassemi said: "What we are clearly witnessing today is that America cannot have a presence in the region." Pointing to the trillions of dollars that Washington had spent on its Middle East wars, Qassemi said Trump's unannounced visit to Iraq on Christmas amounted to a "violation of Iraq's sovereignty and an insult to the people of Iraq." Iran rejects reports of EU conditions to save JCPOA Elsewhere, Qassemi dismissed as "substantially false" reports that the European Union has set conditions for establishing a special payment channel that is supposed to secure its trade commitments under the 2015 nuclear with Tehran. "Today, no country in the world is unmindful of Iran's characteristics and everyone knows that Iran won't allow others to set conditions for it," Qassemi said. Iran and the EU have been working on the so-called Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for a few months now, following US President Donald Trump's decision in May to abandon the Iran deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action (JCPOA). Since then, the Trump administration has targeted Iran's oil and other key economic industries by introducing a series of economic sanctions, threatening other JCPOA signatories – the UK, France, China, Russia and Germany-- to end business with Iran or face penalties. China and Russia have already expressed their commitments to the deal. The SPV is designed to protect European businesses from US financial punishments but progress has been slower than expected. Qassemi said the hurdles that the SPV was faced with stemmed from "Europe's inability to cope with the immense US pressure" and ultimately "the complex nature" of the mechanism that makes the process time consuming. "We think Europe is largely incapable of withstanding the US and its pressure and lack the required ability to defend its European identity as well as its financial and economic institutions," he said. The spokesman stressed that Iran was not relying solely on the SPV and had quietly sought alternative plans with other countries such as China, Russia, India and Turkey. "Although it has so far failed to meet the deadlines on the SPV, we hope that Europe can keep moving on this path and stay true to its commitments," he added.

The Taliban discussed Afghanistan's "post-occupation situation" with Iran in their latest meeting, the group said on Tuesday, as Tehran makes a more concerted and open push for peace ahead of a possible US drawdown. The remarks come after Iran confirmed on Monday that the Taliban had visited Tehran for a second round of talks in just a few days aimed at ending the 17-year conflict. The Taliban delegation discussed with Iran "the post-occupation situation, restoration of peace and security in Afghanistan and the region", the militants said in a statement posted on social media and emailed to journalists. It signals a growing confidence among the Taliban for US troops to pull out of Afghanistan, after US officials last month told various media outlets that President Donald Trump had decided to slash the number of boots on the ground.

Iran worked alongside the United States and Western powers to help drive out the Taliban after the US-led invasion in 2001. But there have been allegations, from Western and Afghan sources, that Iran's Revolutionary Guards have in recent years established ties with the Taliban aimed at driving out US forces from Afghanistan.

News article:
By RFE RL (RFE/RL) — Iran says a Taliban delegation has made a rare visit to Tehran for talks with a senior Iranian official on efforts to end Afghanistan’s 17-year-long war. Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on December 31 that the Taliban delegation arrived on December 30 and met with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi. Qassemi said talks focused on “security issues aimed at driving the peace process in Afghanistan.” He said Kabul was informed about the meeting. It was not the first such meeting between the Taliban and Iranian officials. Ali Shamkhani of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council confirmed last week in Kabul that such talks have taken place in the past and would continue. The Taliban have recently held talks in several regional countries amid Washington’s plans to withdraw up to half the 14,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan.

Iran’s talks with Taliban in coordination with Afghan gov.: official MNA – Chief of Staff of Iranian president said that negotiations between Tehran and Taliban are being held in coordination with the Afghan government. Before meeting with the Taliban delegation, we held talks with the Afghan government, Mahmoud Vaezi told ISNA on Thursday, adding, “I have heard no report indicating that Afghan government is discontented with Iran-Taliban talks.” Iran’s neighboring countries are faced with different challenges, including civil war, and peace and stability is of utmost importance for Tehran, he said, adding, “insecurity in Afghanistan can spread into Iran.” Iran aims to ensure regional peace and security and provide the ground for Afghan-Afghan talks, he said, highlighting, “we never interfere in Afghanistan’s internal issues.” Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Bahram Ghasemi said Monday that a Taliban delegation was in Tehran and that they had comprehensive negotiations with the Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi.

Iran supports peace process, democracy in Afghanistan: Deputy FM Iran Press TV Sat Jan 5, 2019 06:10PM Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs Abbas Araqchi says the Islamic Republic will continue to support the peace process and the promotion of democracy in Afghanistan. "The Islamic Republic of Iran supports the Afghan government and the peace talks under the leadership of the Afghans," Araqchi said in a meeting with Afghanistan's Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah in Kabul on Saturday. He also pointed to last month's negotiations between Iranian authorities and a delegation from the Taliban in Tehran and said the meeting took place in coordination with the Afghan government. Speaking to reporters late in December, Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi said Iran had hosted a delegation from the Taliban to discuss possible ways to end hostilities in Afghanistan. "Since the Taliban are in control of more than 50 percent of Afghanistan, and given the insecurity, instability and other issues that the country is dealing with, they [the Taliban] were interested in talks with Iran," Qassemi said. More than 17 years of the United States' presence in Afghanistan at the top of a military coalition have brought nothing but chaos and insecurity to the country as a result of which all forms of organized crimes, especially production of illicit drugs, have been skyrocketing. The country has also turned into a hotbed of violent acts by major terror outfits, especially Daesh. Following its defeat in Iraq and Syria, Daesh terrorists have been shifting attention to Afghanistan during past months, making the country a new center of their atrocious acts of terrorism in a bid to sow more insecurity across the whole region. Araqchi further stressed the importance of boosting trade and economic cooperation between Tehran and Kabul and said talks were underway to finalize a comprehensive document for joint cooperation. Abdullah, for his part, said Iran and Afghanistan enjoyed cordial and strong relations and added that his country supported efforts to finalize the document for joint cooperation. He commended Iran's efforts to observe the principles of negotiations with terrorist groups and to inform the Afghan government of Tehran's talks with the Taliban. He said the Afghan government supported peace but stressed the establishment of peace should not undermine the achievements made during recent years. Representatives from the Taliban, the US, and regional countries met for the fourth time earlier this month in the Emirati capital Abu Dhabi for talks to end the war in Afghanistan, but the militant group's representatives refused to talk to the Afghan negotiating team. Abdullah's office said Kabul was aware of the whole process of peace talks and that Washington sought to provide the condition for direct talks between the government and the militant group. The United Arab Emirates reported tangible and positive results from the talks. The "US-Taliban reconciliation talks" produced "tangible results that are positive for all parties concerned," UAE state news agency WAM said. Also on Saturday, Araqchi held talks with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his counterpart Idrees Zaman. The senior Iranian official arrived in Kabul on Saturday at the head of a delegation for a day-long visit. His trip came after Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) Ali Shamkhani also paid a one-day visit to Afghanistan at the head of a delegation comprised of a number of high-ranking security, military and political officials in December. During a meeting with Hamdullah Mohib, the Afghan president's national security adviser, Shamkhani said Tehran had been holding a series of talks with the Taliban group "with the knowledge of the Afghan government" and would continue to do so in the future. He also met with senior Afghan officials, including President Ghani, Abdullah and former president Hamid Karzai. NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
Deputy FM: Iran not to forget Taliban’s past crimes FNA – Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araqchi stressed that despite playing a mediatory role in peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban, Tehran can never forget the killing of its diplomats by the group in Mazar-i Sharif in 1998. Araqchi wrote on his twitter page on Sunday that during his current trip to Afghanistan to meet and confer with high-ranking Afghan officials to discuss the recent visit by a Taliban delegation to Tehran to hold talks and help the peace process in the war-torn country, he has also made a visit to Iran’s consulate in Mazar-i Sharif where the Iranian diplomats were martyred by the Taliban in 1998. He underlined that Iran feels a heavy responsibility on its shoulder with regard to the blood of its martyrs, and added, “We look to the future but will never forget the past.” The 1998 killing of the Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan refers to the siege of the Iranian consulate in Mazar-e Sharif, Afghanistan, during the Taliban and Northern Alliance battles of Mazar-e Sharif. Initially the death of 8 Iranian diplomats was reported, but later two other diplomats and a journalist were also confirmed dead. On August 8, 1998 Taliban forces captured Mazar-i-Sharif. After this incident, 11 Iranian diplomats and a correspondent from Iran’s state news agency (IRNA) were attacked at the Iranian consulate and subsequently disappeared. Unofficial reports from the city indicated that all these men were killed. Later it was confirmed that 8 of the Iranian diplomats and the IRNA correspondent were killed by the Taliban militia attacking the consulate. The Taliban spokesmen said the Iranians had been killed by renegade forces who had acted without orders. It was also reported that some of the personnel of the consulate were taken hostage by the Taliban, but they were later released. During his visit to Kabul, Araqchi announced on Saturday that his country was committed to the continued peace process in Afghanistan with the country’s government taking the lead. Araqchi made the remarks in a meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul on Saturday. He also presented a report on the recent meeting between the Iranian officials and the Taliban in Tehran. During the meeting, the two sides underlined the importance of developing all-out ties between the two countries, emphasizing Tehran and Kabul’s full coordination in all aspects to attain better results. Last Monday, Iran confirmed talks with the Taliban to help the peace process, but meantime, stressed that negotiations with the Afghan group did not mean shared views or stances. “A delegation from the Taliban was in Tehran yesterday and extensive talks were held at the foreign ministry with Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs (Seyed Abbas) Araqchi,” Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi told reporters in Tehran on Monday. “The main goal of the negotiations is finding a solution and grounds to facilitate assistance to the talks between the Afghan groups and the government of this country to help the peace process in Afghanistan,” he added. Qassemi underlined that talks with the Taliban “do not necessarily mean that Iran’s positions are similar to those of the group”, and expressed the hope that negotiations could yield results for the Afghan nation and establish security and stability in the country. He also emphasized that the Afghan government was informed of Iran’s talks with the Taliban, and added, “We are not the only country which has held talks with the Taliban and many other states also have interactions with them.” His remarks came as the Pentagon acknowledged in December Iran’s key role in restoring peace and stability to war-torn Afghanistan, backtracking on Washington’s earlier claims that Tehran supports the local Taliban militant group. “Iran seeks a stable Afghan government that is responsive to Iranian goals, the elimination of ISIS-K, the removal of the US/NATO presence, and the protection of Iranian concerns, such as water rights and border security,” the US Department of Defense said in a report sent to Congress. The Pentagon also admitted Iran’s influence in Afghanistan, saying that Tehran pursues “a multitrack strategy” of engaging with the Afghan government and seeks to boost bilateral economic ties with Kabul.

Both Iran and Pakistan enjoy powerful armies and also have common culture and religion, said Naeimabadi, adding that these commonalities lead to friendly relations between the two neighboring states. For his part, Commander of Pakistan’s 9th Auxiliary Warfare Squadron Commodore Muhammad Saleem Sl(M) expressed happiness over friendly ties between Tehran and Islamabad. He said that this visit proves the Pakistani army’s interest in Iran, adding that there are very few countries with which Pakistan has this kind of intimate relations. Appreciating Leader’s views and supports for resolving the crisis in Kashmir, the commander went on to say that Pakistani people respect the leadership of Ayatollah Khamenei.

News article:
Although Turkey has shown interest in resolving the protracted Afghan conflict, experts say there isn't much Ankara can do in this regard. Also, too many uncoordinated peace talks are unlikely to yield results, they say. Turkey is set to host the Afghan peace talks in March. Abdulhakim Mujahid, the head of the Afghan Peace Council, believes it could be a turning point in the efforts to find durable peace in the war-torn country. "Turkey is an important country, which can positively influence regional themes. Both the Afghan government and the Taliban have friendly relations with Ankara," Mujahid told DW. Mujahid, however, did not elaborate what kind of ties exists between Turkey and the Taliban. Some Afghanistan experts claim that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan supported the Afghan Mujahideen (Islamic warriors), particularly the Hezb-e-Islami group, in the 1980s. Hezb-e-Islami, which fought against the Soviet Union, is now an Afghan government ally. Kabul hopes that its peace agreement with Hezb-e-Islami could serve as a blueprint for talks with the Taliban, but many Afghan officials fear that Pakistan could hijack the peace process once again to serve its own interests. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, who recently concluded his trip to Ankara, has once again emphasized the need for peace in Afghanistan and highlighted his country's role in the Abu Dhabi process that paved the way for talks between US representatives and Taliban commanders. But Latif Arasch, a Kabul-based political analyst, warns against high expectations from involving Turkey in the peace process. He is of the view that neither the Taliban nor the US will participate in the Turkey talks, but the summit could still mend bilateral ties between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Read more: Afghanistan: Peace without women's rights? Lacking a direction After Abu Dhabi, the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah has been named as the next venue for the Afghan peace talks, but the Taliban said they would prefer the meeting to be held in Qatar, which hosts the group's international office. The Afghan Peace Council also said it would only send its delegates to Saudi Arabia if the Taliban agreed to engage in talks with Kabul. The Taliban have thus far refused to talk to the Afghan officials, saying they do not consider the Afghan government to be a legitimate representative of the Afghan people. Read more: Why are Kabul and Washington not participating in Moscow-led Taliban talks? Bismillah Randschbar, an expert on Central Asia at the Afghan Center for Strategic Studies, told DW that Afghan peace talks lack a direction. "We can only hope for peace when there are synchronized efforts in a certain direction — when these efforts do not cancel out each other," said Randschbar. Conflicting interests The Taliban seem to have more time and patience before they agree to take part in negotiations. While all parties are now trying to woo them into discussions, the Islamists are not in a hurry. Even Iran, a Shiite-majority country at odds with the hardline Sunni Taliban, does not shy away from expressing its desire to engage with the militant group. Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi recently confirmed a meeting between Iranian officials and the Taliban and traveled to Kabul last weekend to discuss the future of the Chabahar Port that is crucial to the interests of Iran, Afghanistan and India. On the other hand, Pakistan is coordinating efforts with China and Russia to further its own interests. The US has removed Chabahar from its list of Iran sanctions, acknowledging its importance to Afghanistan and India. Experts say the biggest challenge in the present scenario would be to somehow bring different stakeholders closer together and align conflicting geopolitical interests to peace in Afghanistan. But that Turkey could somehow facilitate that would be asking for too much, they say.

News article:
Members of the US delegation in Kabul approached senior Iranian officials to negotiate an end to the conflict in Afghanistan, Tehran has said. The secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, was cited by the Iran Revolutionary Guard-aligned Tasnim News Agency as saying: “the Americans have asked me twice for negotiations”. The US officials reportedly approached Mr Shamkhani when the senior Iranian official was visiting Kabul in December to increase co-operation between the two governments. According to the Iranians, their delegation members had been negotiating with the Taliban, with the knowledge of the Afghan government. Mr Shamkhani was also quoted as saying the US had failed in its attempts to counter ISIS and restore peace to Afghanistan. The United States has been leading an international coalition of states fighting the Taliban and supporting the Afghan government since it ousted the Taliban in 2001. The National contacted the US State Department, but they did not respond to a request for comment at the time of publishing. It is unclear what the US officials want to negotiate, but Iran has previously been accused of assisting the Taliban. _______________ [ Taliban blames US and Afghan forces for most civilian casualties in 2018 ] [ Iran says they held Taliban talks as Afghan peace push continues ] [ Afghans brace for an even deadlier 2019 as hope for peace fades ] Saudi Arabia to host third round of Taliban peace talks _______________ In October, the United States and the Gulf Cooperation Council imposed sanctions on two Iranian Quds Force officers and seven others for providing financial and military support to the group. “Iran’s provision of military training, financing, and weapons to the Taliban is yet another example of Tehran’s blatant regional meddling and support for terrorism," US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at the time. In November, the US displayed remnants of what it said were Iranian weapons supplied to militants in Afghanistan. Iran denies supplying arms to the Taliban. The US move was designed to pressure Tehran to limit its regional activities. Tensions between Iran and the US spiked last May when President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran and reimposed sanctions lifted under the terms of the pact. Iran has simultaneously claimed it is open to talks, while also rejecting US olive branches, framing each rejection of talks as a rebuke to the re-imposition of sanctions, which are crippling the Iranian economy. The United States has led two rounds of peace talks with the Taliban, with a third due to take place in Riyadh next month. The talks are aimed at achieving a ceasefire and bringing the Afghan government and the Taliban to the same negotiating table. But the Taliban have refused to meet with the Afghan government and said they would only talk with the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The United States might hope to use Tehran to convince the Taliban to meet the internationally recognised Afghan government. Meanwhile, Afghanistan is going through one of its bloodiest periods since the US invasion, with the Taliban launching armed assaults and suicide attacks on civilians and government buildings across the country.

News article:
DUBAI: A close aide to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday US officials had approached him during a visit he made last month to Afghanistan to request talks with Tehran, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. Tensions between arch foes, Iran and the United States, have increased since last May, when President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers, and then reimposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic that had been lifted under the terms of the pact. “During my visit to Kabul last month, the Americans... asked to hold talks,” the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, was quoted as saying, without specifying what the US side wanted to discuss. US officials were not immediately available to comment on the report. In 2001, Iran worked with the United States to help set up a new Afghan government to replace the Taliban, which had been toppled by a US-led military campaign following Al-Qaeda’s September 11 attacks on US cities. Shamkhani was in Kabul last month for talks with the Taliban “to help curb the security problems in Afghanistan.” He said the Kabul government had known of his talks with the Taliban. Majority-Shiite Iran has long had close ties to Shiites in neighboring Afghanistan whose militias have fought the Taliban’s Sunni militants. Washington accuses Iran of trying to extend its influence in western Afghanistan by providing military training, financing and weapons to the Taliban, a charge Tehran denies. Shamkhani’s comments came days after reports of talks between US and Taliban officials over proposals for a cease-fire in Afghanistan and a future withdrawal of foreign troops ahead of possible peace negotiations. Khamenei slapped down an offer of direct talks made by Trump last year and Iranian officials have said Washington’s crippling sanctions would fail to wreck the economy. In July, Iranian authorities said Tehran had rejected eight US requests for a meeting between Trump and President Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in Sept 2017. “America’s fantasy and hostile measures have led nowhere, in spite of all their vengeful efforts toward the Iranian people, and will certainly not in the future,” Iranian state TV quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi as saying on Monday. “Our nation will never yield to the cruel pressures of the United States. We will never bend to those who talk the language of sanctions and build walls instead of bridges.”

News article:
KABUL, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Afghan Taliban representatives and U.S. officials will sit down to two days of peace talks on Wednesday in Qatar but Afghan government officials will not be involved, senior Taliban members said. The Taliban have rejected numerous requests from regional powers to allow Afghan officials to take part in the talks, insisting that the United States is their main adversary in the 17-year war and that Kabul is a "puppet" regime. The insurgents, seeking to reimpose strict Islamic law after their 2001 ouster by U.S.-led troops, called off their meeting with the U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia this week because of Riyadh's insistence on bringing the Western-backed Afghan government to the table. The talks will be the fourth in a series between Taliban leaders and U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad. "After mutual consultations, we are going to meet U.S. officials in Doha on Wednesday. The meeting will continue for two days - Wednesday and Thursday," said a senior member of the Afghan Taliban on condition of anonymity. Pakistani and Iranian officials said they were trying to persuade the Taliban to meet Afghan officials. Another senior Taliban leader confirmed the Qatar meeting and said no other country would be involved. Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) took part in the last round of talks in December. "This time we want to hold talks with the American officials," said a Taliban leader based in Afghanistan, adding that they would discuss a U.S. withdrawal, prisoner exchange and the lifting of a ban on movement of their leaders. The war in Afghanistan is America's longest overseas military intervention. It has cost Washington nearly a trillion dollars and killed tens of thousands of people. The United States, which sent troops to Afghanistan in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington and at the peak of the deployment had more than 100,000 troops in the country, withdrew most of its forces in 2014, but still keeps around 14,000 troops there as part of a NATO-led mission aiding Afghan security forces and hunting militants. Reports last month about U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to withdraw thousands of troops from Afghanistan triggered uncertainty in Kabul which depends on the United States and other foreign powers for military support and training. The U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

News article:
Taliban say negotiations with Iran ‘necessary’ Radio Farda – A spokesman for the Afghan Taliban says that negotiations between the militant group and Iran are “necessary.” Spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid described the talks as a political conversation with a neighboring country. Speaking with the state-run Iran Labor News Agency (ILNA) on January 5, he said, “We should discuss the future of our country with Tehran in order to take positive steps toward strengthening friendship and peace on both sides.” He stressed that the group would keep its channels open to Iran. The ultra-conservative Sunni group dispatched a delegation to Iran last week to meet with a group of Iranian diplomats led by Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Tehran. Iran says the meeting aimed to promote peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban and that the Afghan government had been informed. Following the talks, Araghchi traveled to Kabul to brief Afghan authorities on the meetings. This is not the first time the Afghan Taliban have sent a delegation to Tehran. In 2015, a Taliban delegation based in Qatar and led by the head of the group’s political bureau, Tayyib Aqa, also visited the Iranian capital. The secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, recently visited Kabul and said Tehran had held talks with the Taliban. “We have a single leadership and policy, and therefore we are in contact with many neighboring and non-neighboring countries,” ILNA quoted Mujahid as saying. “Our contact with Iran is the same as that of other countries, and maintaining contact with Iran is very important to us.” Previously, the Afghan Taliban had said the delegation’s aim was to discuss the future withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and regional stability. “The delegation visited Tehran to share Taliban’s views on a ‘post-occupation’ scenario and establishment of peace and security in Afghanistan and the region with Iranian officials,” Mujahid said in a statement that reflected growing confidence among the Taliban for an imminent U.S. exit from Afghanistan. The Taliban’s talks in Tehran come amid repeated accusations by Washington that Iran is training and equipping the insurgents. Tehran has dismissed such allegations as unfounded. In his interview with ILNA, Mujahid criticized the Islamic State (IS) militant group, saying it has “dangerous designs” for the region. “Frankly, the Afghan people find IS’s beliefs problematic. IS does not observe any Islamic laws, and their beliefs have no roots in Islam or Shari’a,” he said. Mujahid also had strong words for the foreign forces currently deployed in Afghanistan. “If the Taliban concludes that Americans are not seeking to achieve peace through negotiations and do not withdraw their troops from Afghanistan, we will without doubt dispatch them with military force and during the intensification of jihad from Afghanistan,” he said. After weeks of Pentagon officials denying reports of a U.S. drawdown from Afghanistan, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence confirmed on January 4 that U.S. President Donald Trump is in “the process of evaluating” whether to withdraw troops from the war-torn country. “The biggest issue that matters to us is the dismissal of U.S. troops. Of course, solutions have been considered, but the Americans have accepted that more talks are needed about how they will leave Afghanistan and that they will be followed up in the upcoming summit,” Mujahid said. “We have not stopped jihad and are still at war with the Americans, and on the other hand we recognize the government of national unity as a puppet of the United States,” he added. Mujahid did not rule out the possibility of the Taliban’s participation in Afghanistan’s next election, but noted, “First of all, we believe that the occupation of Afghanistan by the United States must come to an end. The next step is to determine the structure of the political system that will eventually be voted for by the Afghans.”

Taliban say negotiations with Iran ‘necessary’ Radio Farda – A spokesman for the Afghan Taliban says that negotiations between the militant group and Iran are “necessary.” Spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid described the talks as a political conversation with a neighboring country. Speaking with the state-run Iran Labor News Agency (ILNA) on January 5, he said, “We should discuss the future of our country with Tehran in order to take positive steps toward strengthening friendship and peace on both sides.” He stressed that the group would keep its channels open to Iran. The ultra-conservative Sunni group dispatched a delegation to Iran last week to meet with a group of Iranian diplomats led by Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Tehran. Iran says the meeting aimed to promote peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban and that the Afghan government had been informed. Following the talks, Araghchi traveled to Kabul to brief Afghan authorities on the meetings. This is not the first time the Afghan Taliban have sent a delegation to Tehran. In 2015, a Taliban delegation based in Qatar and led by the head of the group’s political bureau, Tayyib Aqa, also visited the Iranian capital. The secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, recently visited Kabul and said Tehran had held talks with the Taliban. “We have a single leadership and policy, and therefore we are in contact with many neighboring and non-neighboring countries,” ILNA quoted Mujahid as saying. “Our contact with Iran is the same as that of other countries, and maintaining contact with Iran is very important to us.” Previously, the Afghan Taliban had said the delegation’s aim was to discuss the future withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and regional stability. “The delegation visited Tehran to share Taliban’s views on a ‘post-occupation’ scenario and establishment of peace and security in Afghanistan and the region with Iranian officials,” Mujahid said in a statement that reflected growing confidence among the Taliban for an imminent U.S. exit from Afghanistan. The Taliban’s talks in Tehran come amid repeated accusations by Washington that Iran is training and equipping the insurgents. Tehran has dismissed such allegations as unfounded. In his interview with ILNA, Mujahid criticized the Islamic State (IS) militant group, saying it has “dangerous designs” for the region. “Frankly, the Afghan people find IS’s beliefs problematic. IS does not observe any Islamic laws, and their beliefs have no roots in Islam or Shari’a,” he said. Mujahid also had strong words for the foreign forces currently deployed in Afghanistan. “If the Taliban concludes that Americans are not seeking to achieve peace through negotiations and do not withdraw their troops from Afghanistan, we will without doubt dispatch them with military force and during the intensification of jihad from Afghanistan,” he said. After weeks of Pentagon officials denying reports of a U.S. drawdown from Afghanistan, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence confirmed on January 4 that U.S. President Donald Trump is in “the process of evaluating” whether to withdraw troops from the war-torn country. “The biggest issue that matters to us is the dismissal of U.S. troops. Of course, solutions have been considered, but the Americans have accepted that more talks are needed about how they will leave Afghanistan and that they will be followed up in the upcoming summit,” Mujahid said. “We have not stopped jihad and are still at war with the Americans, and on the other hand we recognize the government of national unity as a puppet of the United States,” he added. Mujahid did not rule out the possibility of the Taliban’s participation in Afghanistan’s next election, but noted, “First of all, we believe that the occupation of Afghanistan by the United States must come to an end. The next step is to determine the structure of the political system that will eventually be voted for by the Afghans.”

News article:
Militants reject requests to meet "puppet" Afghan government By Jibran Ahmad PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Afghan Taliban representatives will meet U.S. officials for two days of peace talks starting on Wednesday, but they refuse to meet "puppet" Afghan government officials, senior Taliban members said. The Taliban have rejected requests from regional powers to allow Afghan officials to take part in the talks, insisting that the United States is their main adversary in the 17-year war. "This time we want to hold talks with the American officials," said a Taliban leader based in Afghanistan, adding that the talks in Qatar would involve a U.S. withdrawal, prisoner exchange and the lifting of a ban on movement of Taliban leaders. The insurgents, seeking to reimpose strict Islamic law after their 2001 ouster by U.S.-led troops, called off a meeting with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia this week because of Riyadh's insistence on bringing the Western-backed Afghan government to the table. The war in Afghanistan is America's longest overseas military intervention. It has cost Washington nearly a trillion dollars and killed tens of thousands of people. The talks will be the fourth in a series between Taliban leaders and U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad. "After mutual consultations, we are going to meet U.S. officials in Doha on Wednesday. The meeting will continue for two days," a senior member of the Taliban said on condition of anonymity. Former Afghan Interior Minister Umer Daudzai, who is senior adviser to President Ashraf Ghani, is due in Pakistan on Tuesday where he is expected to meet Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi. Pakistani officials say Afghanistan will need foreign economic aid for years, even after any peace agreement has been signed, and have also been trying to push the Taliban to accept talks with Kabul. PAKISTAN COOPERATION A close aide to Ghani said the government was ready to meet the Taliban "anywhere and any time". "Every country involved in Afghanistan expects the Taliban to hold direct talks with the Afghan government, but they have not agreed to meet us," the official said on condition of anonymity. Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) took part in the last round of talks in December. Western diplomats based in Kabul said Pakistan's cooperation in the peace process will be crucial to its success. Independent security analysts and diplomats said the neighbouring country's powerful military has kept close ties with the Afghan Taliban. U.S. officials have accused Pakistan of providing safe haven to Taliban militants in its border regions and using them as an arm of its foreign policy. Pakistan denies the claim. Turkey has said it will host leaders of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Last week, Iran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, met Ghani in Kabul to discuss the peace process. The meeting was held after Taliban officials met with Iranian authorities in Tehran. The United States, which sent troops to Afghanistan in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington and at the peak of the deployment had more than 100,000 troops in the country, withdrew most of its forces in 2014. It keeps around 14,000 troops there as part of a NATO-led mission aiding Afghan security forces and hunting militants. Reports last month about U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to withdraw thousands of troops from Afghanistan triggered uncertainty in Kabul which depends on the United States and other foreign powers for military support and training. As peace talks gain momentum a draft agreement drawn up by the influential U.S. think tank RAND Corporation outlining the clauses for a potential peace deal has been circulated among Afghan officials and diplomats in Kabul. The document, reviewed by Reuters, suggests that the United States and NATO withdraw their military missions in phases over an expected period of 18 months. It adds that the United States may continue providing civilian assistance and seek contributions from other donors. The U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan and Zalmay Khalilzad's office in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Afghan Gov. direct talks with Taliban shortest way to achieve lasting peace: Ambassador IRNA - Islamic Republic News Agency Tehran, Jan 7, IRNA -- Afghan ambassador to Tehran says that the shortest way for a lasting peace in Afghanistan is direct talks between his government and the Taliban to realize the practical and lasting result. In an exclusive interview with the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), Ahmad Nour referred to the growing relations between Afghanistan and Iran, and said, 'As an embassy in Tehran, there is almost no week that we are not witnessing the reception and coming of a delegation, and even more than a delegation, which is mostly at the level of Ministers, deputy of Ministers and Experts. In addition to this, leaders of the two countries for institutionalizing the ties required developing a comprehensive document on long-term cooperation between the two countries and this document is a basic document regarding the cooperation of the two countries." Afghanistan's ambassador to Tehran, in response to a question about the transfer of the ISIS (Daesh) to Afghanistan, said that ISIS in Iraq and Syria are different from those operating under the name of the ISIS in Afghanistan. The ISIS of Afghanistan has come out of the context of Taliban and the elements of the group are the Taliban elements that have put down a white flag and raised the black one, otherwise we do not see any the difference between the two in terms of the nature, ideology, goals and practices. About the US security strategy in Afghanistan, which was announced about a year ago, as well as the announcement of troop withdrawal by US president Donald Trump in recent days, he said, "The coalition in Afghanistan had 130,000 to 140,000 predominantly American troops before 2014. At the same time, Americans announced that they would reduce their troops in Afghanistan. But we saw that this great departure did not have a very negative impact on Afghanistan, and despite the fact that our security forces were newcomers at the time, they were able to take on their responsibilities well and maintain cities, roads and major centers." 'The Afghan government and nation have been thirsty for peace for many years, and we are on this path; we welcome every way and in a solution that brings about a sustained and dignified peace and reconciliation,' said the Afghan diplomat in talks and contacts recently conducted with the Taliban group. He added, 'We welcome and thank all brotherly and friendly countries that will help us in this way, but we emphasize that the issue of peace and negotiations with Taliban should be on managing the Afghan government. Answering a question about the outlook of reaching an understanding with the Taliban, Nour said, "We are hopeful. It is up to the Taliban to take advantage of the opportunity and consider the very comprehensive proposal for negotiations and peace that the President introduced in the second Kabul process and see whether they want to have a role in the political future of Afghanistan. In response to another question about US unilateral sanctions against Iran and the possible impact of these sanctions on Iran-Afghanistan relations, including the Chabahar agreement, Afghan ambassador said, "It is our wish to see a world without tensions, sanctions and conflict, and if anything we can do, we are glad to do our best, but as far as the current sanctions are concerned, the Americans have stated that the Chabahar port project is exception to US sanctions.' Ahmad Nour continued, 'The relationship between Tehran and Washington is not related to these days and have lasted for four decades.' During these 16 years or more when Americans in Afghanistan have a significant presence, our relationship with our brotherly neighbor (Iran) is getting stronger every day, and the presence of Americans and the strategic relationship between Afghanistan and the United States has no effect on our relations with Iran. 9455**2050 NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
ISLAMABAD: Renewed efforts for finding a path towards lasting peace and security inside Afghanistan was the main topic of discussion between Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Afghan President's Special Envoy on Afghan Reconciliation Omer Daudzai at the Foreign Office on Tuesday. With a change in dynamics of the Afghan issue, Pakistan is in the forefront and Islamabad is the first capital that Daudzai has chosen to visit after he took over his new office. Kabul hopes that Pakistan can push the Afghan Taliban to agree to start talks with the government of Ashraf Ghani. So far, the Taliban call the shots and have refused any such meeting. “Pakistan will continue to play its vigorous role for bringing lasting peace in Afghanistan. Peace and stability in Afghanistan is in Pakistan’s own best national interest, and necessary for economic development and prosperity in the region,” Qureshi was quoted by his office as telling the Afghan dignitary. He told the Afghan dignitary that there was a growing international convergence on the need to end the suffering of the people of Afghanistan through peaceful settlement of conflict. Qureshi recently visited several regional countries with Afghanistan on top of his agenda, where there was an agreement that a political solution was the only answer to the conflict inside Afghanistan. In this regard, Pakistan says it will do all to help the people of Afghanistan and see the earliest possible end to bloodshed to enter a new phase of peace and prosperity. As Daudzai flew into Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban have cancelled peace talks with officials from the United States in Qatar which were to start today (Wednesday) following disagreements over the agenda of the meeting, the group confirmed on Tuesday. As the US tried to rope in representatives of the Kabul government, the Taliban rejected the participation of the Afghan government officials in the deliberations. Daudzai conveyed the deep appreciation of the sincerity and vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan for peace and stability in Afghanistan. “The foreign minister’s visits to Kabul within on bringing the Western-backed Afghan government to the table. The talks will be the fourth in a series between Taliban leaders and US special envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad. "After mutual consultations, we are going to meet US officials in Doha on Wednesday. The meeting will continue for two days - Wednesday and Thursday," said a senior member of the Afghan Taliban on condition of anonymity. Pakistani and Iranian officials said they were trying to persuade the Taliban to meet Afghan officials. Another senior Taliban leader confirmed the Qatar meeting and said no other country would be involved. At the request of the US, a Taliban office was established in Doha in 2013 to facilitate peace talks. But the office had to be closed after the Taliban came under pressure for hoisting the same flag at their office that the group used during its rule in Afghanistan. Subsequently, the then Afghan President Hamid Karzai halted all peace efforts, saying the Doha office was presenting itself as an unofficial embassy for a government-in-exile. The flag has since been taken down and the office has remained empty with no official announcements of a possible reopening. Talks with the Taliban have since been taking place elsewhere in Doha.

Iran vows help to Afghanistan-Taliban talks IRNA – A top military advisor to the Iranian Supreme Leader highlighted the importance of promoting security in Afghanistan and voiced Iran’s willingness to help talks between Afghan government and Taliban to reach understanding. Speaking in an exclusive interview with the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), Major General Hassan Firouzabadi said Iran is conducting negotiations with Taliban in the framework of international regulations. He added that Taliban is willing to play a role in establishing peace in Afghanistan. As part of Afghan society, Taliban has its own opinions and tends to have a share in Afghan defense and security bodies, he noted. Referring to the fact that Iran pursues interests in holding talks with Taliban, Firouzabadi said since Iran is neighbors with Afghanistan, its security is of prime importance for Tehran so Iran has agreed to help negotiations between the Afghan government and Taliban group to make them develop a common understanding to be able to confront enemies. Earlier on December 31, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi confirmed that a Taliban delegation held extensive talks with Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister for political affairs Abbas Araqchi in Tehran. Meanwhile, The Taliban spokesman Zabihollah Mojahed has acknowledged Iran attempts to establish peace and stability in Afghanistan. In his statement, Mojahed announced that the Taliban delegation had a trip to Tehran to pursue peace process in Afghanistan. Elsewhere in his remarks, Firouzabadi referred to Iran’s positive role in the region, saying that in current conditions, Iran is playing major role in establishing security in the region. Pointing to developments in eastern Euphrates, he said Iraq and Turkey will own their share of this area. Highlighting Iran’s support of other countries’ legal sovereignty, he said based on the agreements between Iran, Turkey, Russia, Iraq and Syria, all sides are for respecting the defined border lines. Elsewhere in the interview, Firouzabadi referred to Yemeni war, saying US is going in the way of aggression, intervention and viciousness. He also urged the US to stop its interventions because it is America’s ultimate fate to leave the region. Saudi Arabia and its regional allies attacked Yemen in March 2015 to bring back to power the deposed president of Yemen Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Since then, the invaders have committed horrible war crimes against Yemeni civilians.

Saudi Arabia and its regional allies attacked Yemen in March 2015 to bring back to power the deposed president of Yemen Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Since then, the invaders have committed horrible war crimes against Yemeni civilians.

Iran vows help to Afghanistan-Taliban talks IRNA – A top military advisor to the Iranian Supreme Leader highlighted the importance of promoting security in Afghanistan and voiced Iran’s willingness to help talks between Afghan government and Taliban to reach understanding. Speaking in an exclusive interview with the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), Major General Hassan Firouzabadi said Iran is conducting negotiations with Taliban in the framework of international regulations. He added that Taliban is willing to play a role in establishing peace in Afghanistan. As part of Afghan society, Taliban has its own opinions and tends to have a share in Afghan defense and security bodies, he noted. Referring to the fact that Iran pursues interests in holding talks with Taliban, Firouzabadi said since Iran is neighbors with Afghanistan, its security is of prime importance for Tehran so Iran has agreed to help negotiations between the Afghan government and Taliban group to make them develop a common understanding to be able to confront enemies. Earlier on December 31, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi confirmed that a Taliban delegation held extensive talks with Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister for political affairs Abbas Araqchi in Tehran. Meanwhile, The Taliban spokesman Zabihollah Mojahed has acknowledged Iran attempts to establish peace and stability in Afghanistan. In his statement, Mojahed announced that the Taliban delegation had a trip to Tehran to pursue peace process in Afghanistan. Elsewhere in his remarks, Firouzabadi referred to Iran’s positive role in the region, saying that in current conditions, Iran is playing major role in establishing security in the region. Pointing to developments in eastern Euphrates, he said Iraq and Turkey will own their share of this area. Highlighting Iran’s support of other countries’ legal sovereignty, he said based on the agreements between Iran, Turkey, Russia, Iraq and Syria, all sides are for respecting the defined border lines. Elsewhere in the interview, Firouzabadi referred to Yemeni war, saying US is going in the way of aggression, intervention and viciousness. He also urged the US to stop its interventions because it is America’s ultimate fate to leave the region. Saudi Arabia and its regional allies attacked Yemen in March 2015 to bring back to power the deposed president of Yemen Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Since then, the invaders have committed horrible war crimes against Yemeni civilians.

News article:
Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print By Staff Writer Afghanistan has criticised Iran regime’s comments from senior officials that reveal the Regime’s contacts with the Taliban and project a role for the terror cell in the future Afghan government. Deputy Afghan Foreign Minister Idrees Zaman tweeted on January 10: “Afghanistan’s Foreign Affairs Ministry reiterates that any kind of relations with the Taliban outside the bilateral relations [between Iran and Afghanistan] will weaken our relations.” He was responding to comments made by Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif on January 9, in which he revealed that the Iranian secret service and government maintains talks with the Taliban; something long suspected. Zarif said: “I think it would be impossible to have a future Afghanistan without any role for the Taliban. But we also believe that the Taliban do not have, should not have, a dominant role in Afghanistan.” He then claimed that Iran only maintains contact with the Taliban for border security reasons, because the Taliban occupies parts of Iran’s border with Afghanistan. Understandably, this angered many in Kabul and deputy Afghan presidential spokesperson Shah Hussain Murtazawi even accused Iranian officials of working as spokespeople for the Taliban. He then explained that Iran was uneasy about the restoration of democracy and civil rights in Afghanistan, which is why the renewed interest in relations with the Taliban. He said: “There is no media freedom [in Iran]. You need approval from Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati [chairman of Iran’s Guardian Council] to participate in elections. Religious and ethnic minorities are under enormous pressure. Iran is worried that the freedoms in Afghanistan will set an example and therefore defend the Taliban’s arguments.” In a Facebook post that was later deleted, he questioned why, if Iran is so set on maintaining diplomatic talks, they do not look domestically and talk to their opposition the Mojahedin-e Khalq (PMOI/MEK); a group that espouses the need for democracy in Iran and has been banned in the country since the 1980s. Its members are constantly targeted by the Regime, even outside of Iran. The Taliban and Tehran have found common ground in recent years, despite Iran being mobilised for war against the Taliban in the late 1990s, with a delegation from the Taliban visited Tehran and met Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghci in December. In fact, Tehran has even approached Kabul for peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. While US-backed peace talks between Afghanistan and the Taliban, aimed at ending the 18-year-long war, have hit a snag after the Taliban cancelled the fourth round of talks in Qatar.

News article:
To clearly understand the voices coming from Washington on Afghanistan, the following seems to be honest appraisals and coherent insight into the burning issue. Noted journalist Pamela Constable wrote in The Washington Post recently: “Everyone, it seems, is pushing for peace in Afghanistan these days. President Trump’s special envoy is racing around the region, trying to drum up support for talks with the insurgent Taliban. The Russians, eager to get into the act, have hosted a conference on the issue. The Pakistanis insist they want to help end the war. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani hopes to win reelection in April as the man who brought peace to his country after 17 years. The Taliban, however, seems to be in no hurry at all.” Earlier, in August 2018, columnist Max Boot commented in the Washington Post: “There are certain enduring rituals in US foreign policy that are pursued whether they have any chance of success. Every administration since Franklin D. Roosevelt’s has tried to improve relations with Moscow. Every administration since Harry S Truman’s has tried to solve the Israeli-Arab dispute. Every administration since Jimmy Carter’s has tried to persuade the Iranian mullahs to behave better. And every administration since Bill Clinton’s has tried to negotiate with the Taliban.” Max Boot added: “The only thing preventing the fall of the government is the presence of 14,000 US troops. But the United States’ determination to remain in Afghanistan after nearly 17 years is wearing thin… If you were the Taliban, why would you negotiate now? From the Taliban’s perspective, an agreement would only make sense if, like the Paris Peace Accords with North Vietnam in 1973, it was supposed to provide the United States a ‘decent interval’ between its pullout and the defeat of its local allies.” Jason Lyall of Yale University came out with five key lessons from Taliban’s deadly resurgence in 2018, especially the attack on Ghazni: He said that (1) Talking and fighting are complements, not substitutes for the Taliban. (2) Afghan forces are nowhere near ready to stand on their own. (3) The Afghan government has a major credibility problem. (4) The Taliban can’t capture cities but that may not matter. (5) Air power is not a silver bullet. Lyall concluded: “We are unlikely, then, to see any substantial reductions in violence in the near term as negotiations with the Taliban continue. While temporary cease-fires may be honored, the Taliban will continue to seek tactical, often temporary, battlefield victories, until convinced that its political demands will be met. Talking and fighting might lead eventually to a negotiated settlement, but the path to that settlement is likely to be long and bloody.” The Wall street Journal in a piece commented: “Afghan and US government estimates put the number of Taliban as high as 70,000 fighters, including underground supporters and regular and auxiliary fighters. The movement has broadened beyond its ethnic Pashtun base to include Afghans of all ethnic backgrounds. “It is capable of implementing governance policy across a large territory from top to bottom,” according to Ashley Jackson, a researcher who surveyed 20 districts controlled at least in part by the Taliban. “Experts say the Taliban’s unity, largely maintained throughout its existence and shown in a three-day cease-fire this summer, is remarkable for an insurgency. That suggests the leadership could enforce any peace deal it signs. “The Taliban have strong command-and-control that they demonstrated in a nationwide cease-fire in which tens of thousands of fighters to a person obeyed,” said Johnny Walsh, formerly lead adviser on the Afghan peace process at the US State Department.” Meanwhile, Pakistan has actively demonstrated its diplomatic outreach for making the peace process a success. Pakistan has facilitated the first round of negotiations. In the aftermath, Pakistan’s foreign minister has carried out shuttle diplomatic tour of Afghanistan, Iran, China and Russia, taking these important regional players into confidence about the progress in talks.
