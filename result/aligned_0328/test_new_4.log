(MENAFN- Daily News Egypt) Oman will open its embassy in the Israeli-occupied West Bank according to the country's foreign ministry's statement on Wednesday on Twitter. "In continuation to Oman authority's support to the brotherly Palestinian people, it has decreed to open a new diplomatic mission in Palestine at the level of the embassy," the ministry said. A delegation from the ministry of foreign affairs will head directly to Ramallah to initiate the required procedures, the ministry added. Oman's decision came during the second and last day of the United States-hosted conference in Bahrain which the US said, aims to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and encourage investing in the Gaza strip and the West Bank. The US has revealed the economic part of its Mideast peace plan or what widely become known as 'deal of the century.' Oman has not publicly revealed or confirmed if it is attending the conference or not. Several Arab and foreign investors are invited to attend the conference. Earlier in February 2018, Oman's State Minister for Foreign Affairs, Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, visited Al-Aqsa Mosque in a rare public visit of an Arab official to the Occupied Territories. The Manama conference has been held on Tuesday, Wednesday 25-26 June and led by the US President Donald Trump's son-in-law and Senior Adviser, Jared Kushner. The Palestinian Authority is boycotting the conference and previously declared that it will not accept any settlement which does not include an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar are participating in the US economic workshop. For Egypt, an official economic delegation from the ministry of finance will attend the conference 'to hear out the propositions,' a high-ranking Egyptian official told Daily News Egypt on condition of anonymity. Managing Director and Chairperson of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, World Bank Group President, David Malpass, and FIFA President, Gianni Infantino also attended the event. Kushner announced that the 'deal of the century' will include $50bn in investments in the Palestinian Territories, Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon in its first phase. Out of the total amount, $13.38bn would be grants, $25.689bn would be subsidised loans, and $11.6bn would be private investments.

News article:
The US-organised economic workshop in Bahrain failed to deliver tangible results over the long-awaited Middle East peace plan but it opened the door for closer Israeli-Gulf ties, analysts say. Despite this, the normalisation of ties between the Gulf oil monarchies and the Jewish state -- staunch US allies who have common concerns over Iran -- remains unlikely without progress in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they say. In an unprecedented interview of a senior Gulf official by an Israeli journalist, Bahrain's Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa said on the sidelines of the two-day workshop in Manama that Israel is part of the region's heritage. "Israel is part of this heritage of this whole region, historically, so the Jewish people have a place amongst us," he said in the interview broadcast late Wednesday on Israel's Channel 13 television. Sheikh Khalid, a member of the ruling family of the tiny state, called in a separate interview with the Times of Israel for improved relations with Israel, but reiterated his country's commitment to the Arab Peace Initiative. Neil Partrick, a London-based Middle East analyst, said the Bahraini foreign minister's comments "will be the main achievement" of the workshop "as far as the US and Israel are concerned". Meanwhile, an Israeli journalist published on her Twitter account an interview with prominent UAE businessman Mohammed Alabbar, who was among a group of business leaders who attended the Bahrain workshop. "Young people and our children... want to live a life that has hope and optimism and a better future," Alabbar, chief of real estate giant Emaar Properties, told the journalist when asked what message he wants to send Israeli audiences. - 'Clear' message - After getting special permission, a handful of Israeli journalists attended the conference in Bahrain, with which their country has no diplomatic relations -- like all Arab countries excluding Jordan and Egypt. "Countries such as Bahrain are more willing to float the carrot of overt engagement, but I think it would be highly premature to expect anything beyond flirtation without meaningful change on the ground," said Elizabeth Dickinson, senior analyst with the International Crisis Group think-tank. "The Gulf message is actually somewhat clear in my view: Israel could be a useful, stable ally in a volatile region -- but only if there is an agreement with the Palestinians," she told AFP. In recent years Israel has been courting Arab nations which do not recognise the Jewish state, and in October Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held surprise talks in Muscat with the ruler of Oman. These efforts at rapprochement came as Iran -- the arch-foe of Israel and regional rival Saudi Arabia -- was bolstering its influence in several Arab countries. US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, launched the long-awaited Middle East initiative at the conference, which the Palestinian Authority boycotted over fears it sought to buy off the Palestinians and deprive them of an independent state. - Normalisation 'some way off' - Partrick said it remained unlikely the conference in Bahrain "will lead directly to full diplomatic relations with Israel without the Palestinian leadership backing the final and political 'deal'". He said the "full and proper political normalisation with Israel is still some way off", especially after the United States recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in 2017. According to the International Crisis Group, normalisation of ties between Arab countries and Israel still depends on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. "If the Bahrain workshop secures a place in future history books, it will be for exposing the limits of Arab-Israeli rapprochement," it said in a report on Wednesday. It underlines that "Israel's overt acceptance in the region requires it to resolve its conflict with the Palestinians," it said. The Palestinians have boycotted the US administration since Trump broke with decades of consensus by recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city last year. US officials have hinted the political part of the Middle East plan -- which could come out later this year -- will not mention the creation of an independent Palestinian state, a goal of decades of US diplomacy.

Israel's foreign minister on Sunday visited the United Arab Emirates as part of the UN Environment Conference, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, reports Anadolu Agency. Meeting with UAE officials, Yisrael Katz discussed developing ties with the UAE in high technology, energy, agriculture, and water management, said a ministry statement on Monday. Regional issues were also discussed, including the need to deal with the threat of a nuclear Iran, that country's ballistic missile development, and its support for terrorists in the region, the statement said. READ: UAE, Israel had secret relations for 20 years Katz took part in the UN's two-day Abu Dhabi Climate conference where he also met with the UN secretary-general. According to the Israeli media, Katz presented the "Paths for Regional Peace" initiative on an economic and strategic connection between the Gulf states, via Jordan, the Israeli railway network, and Haifa ports in the Mediterranean. "I am excited to stand here in Abu Dhabi and represent the interests of the state of Israel vis-a-vis the Arab Gulf states," Katz said. "I will continue to work with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to promote the normalization policy with the strength we are leading, based on Israel's capabilities, both in the fields of security and intelligence and in various civilian areas," he added.

The head of the Mossad intelligence service said Monday that Israel was renewing ties with Oman. “Just recently, renewal of formal relations with Oman was declared and the establishment of a representative office of the foreign ministry in that country,” Yossi Cohen said at the Herzliya Conference, hosted by the Interdisciplinary Center this week. “That is only the visible tip of a much broader secret effort,” he said, adding that in addition to Israel’s historic treaties with Jordan and Egypt, other Arab countries had discreetly joined “the states of peace, some of them in an unseen manner.” “We do not yet have with them official peace treaties but there is already a communality of interests, broad cooperation and open channels of communication,” he added. Israel and Oman agreed to open trade representative offices in the 1990s, but in 2000 the Gulf sultanate closed them after the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada.

In October, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held surprise talks with Oman’s Sultan Qaboos bin Said in Muscat. The recent moves have raised Palestinian fears of a normalization of ties. Advertisement Last week Oman said it would open an embassy in the Palestinian territories in support of the Palestinian people, in a first for a Gulf state. The announcement was greeted warily by senior Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi, who warned Oman against using the new embassy as a step towards establishing formal relations with Israel. “If this has a political price attached then certainly there will be ramifications,” she said. Mutual concerns about Shiite Iran have lately highlighted common interests between some Arab countries and Israel. In an unprecedented step, a handful of Israeli journalists invited by the White House flew openly to Bahrain last week for a US-sponsored workshop unveiling economic planks of a broader plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace. The Gulf state has no diplomatic relations with Israel. Advertisement On Monday Israel’s foreign ministry said in a statement that Foreign Minister Israel Katz had visited Abu Dhabi for a UN climate conference, where he met United Nations chief Antonio Guterres and an unnamed “high ranking UAE official.” “I shall continue to work together with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to advance the normalization policy,” Katz posted on Facebook. That policy, he wrote, was based on “Israel’s capabilities in the areas of security and intelligence and also in various civilian fields.” The United Arab Emirates do not have formal diplomatic ties with the Jewish state but Culture Minister Miri Regev paid a visit to Abu Dhabi in October. The statement did not say when Katz was there but described his visit as the first by a senior Israeli minister since the Bahrain conference. In his Monday speech, Cohen said that a potentially one-time-only window of opportunity had opened for Israel to achieve a regional peace agreement in light of shared opposition to Iran and Islamist terror groups, as well as improved ties with the US and Russia. “The Mossad has identified at this time a rare opportunity — perhaps the first in the history of the Middle East — to reach a regional understanding that would lead to an inclusive regional peace agreement,” he said. According to the Mossad chief, the opportunity comes from a shared interest with countries throughout the region in fighting Iran and Islamic terror groups, like the Islamic State, and from the close relations with the White House and the Kremlin. Advertisement “This creates a window of opportunity that is perhaps one-time-only,” he said. Cohen in his speech accused the Iranian government of being behind a number of strikes on oil facilities and ships in the Persian Gulf in recent months, as well as an attack on the Bahraini embassy in Baghdad last week. “I say to you, with certainty, based on the best sources of both Israeli and Western espionage, that Iran is behind these attacks. They were approved by Iranian leadership and carried out, in large part, by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its proxies,” he said. He accused Tehran of trying “to start a fire” in in the Middle East. The Mossad chief warned that Iran was extending the range of its activities and had established a 300-person cell inside Africa for that purpose. Cohen also noted that Iran has been accused of conducting and planning a number of terrorist activities inside Europe in recent years. In an apparent reference to reported Israeli strikes on Iranian targets in Syria early Monday, the head of the Mossad said Israel was not interested in a conflict with its neighbor. According to Cohen, Iran and its proxy Hezbollah in Syria have started transferring their forces farther from the border with Israel in a bid to avoid further strikes by the Israeli military. “Iran and Hezbollah are asking to move their bases to northern Syria, an area that they mistakenly believe will be difficult for us to reach. In addition, they are establishing bases and precision missile factories in Iraq, to the east, and Lebanon, to the west,” he said. Israel has for years warned that Iran and Hezbollah were attempting to establish factories in Lebanon to produce precision-guided missiles, which would present a far greater threat to Israel than the less advanced projectiles that currently fill the terror group’s arsenals.

Israel is renewing formal relations with Oman and plans to open a diplomatic mission in the Sultanate, Yossi Cohen, the head of Israel's intelligence agency Mossad, has claimed. Speaking at a conference yesterday in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, Cohen claimed that "just recently, renewal of formal relations with Oman was declared and the establishment of a representative office of the foreign ministry in that country". He added that the move "is only the visible tip of a much broader secret effort," presumably referring to Israel's efforts to normalise relations with Arab and Muslim states. Cohen claimed that though "we [Israel] do not yet have with [other Arab states] official peace treaties, […] there is already a communality of interests, broad cooperation and open channels of communication". Israel's Foreign Ministry has declined to comment on Cohen's remarks, the Times of Israel reported. Likewise Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – who has long sought to emphasise Israel's normalisation drive – has not commented on the renewal of ties. Cohen also spoke of "a rare opportunity — perhaps the first in the history of the Middle East — to reach a regional understanding that would lead to an inclusive regional peace agreement". He pointed to Israel and many Gulf states' shared goal of countering Iranian influence in the region, and claimed with "certainty" that Iran was responsible for a number of recent attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Though the US and Saudi Arabia have accused Iran of orchestrating the attacks, Iran has vehemently denied these claims. The UAE has also softened its accusations against Iran, claiming there is "insufficient information" to hold Iran accountable. READ: Israel foreign minister visits Abu Dhabi Cohen's claims come less than a week after Oman announced that it would open a diplomatic mission to the Palestinians in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank. Oman's Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote in a tweet that "in continuation of the Sultanate's support for the Palestinian people, the Sultanate has decided to open a new diplomatic mission to the State of Palestine at the level of an embassy". The ministry also said that a delegation "will travel to Ramallah to initiate the opening of the embassy," without providing further details or a timescale. Oman's announcement was made against the backdrop of last week's "Peace to Prosperity" conference in the Bahraini capital Manama, during which the economic aspects of the long-awaited "deal of the century" were discussed. The majority of Gulf states attended the conference, despite the Palestinian factions' appeal for Arab countries to boycott the summit. The Palestinian Authority (PA) has since arrested – and subsequently released – a Palestinian businessman who attended the conference, while the besieged Gaza Strip witnessed mass protests condemning Arab states' participation in the summit.

JERUSALEM: The head of Israel´s intelligence agency Mossad said Monday his country was renewing ties with Oman and had an “unprecedented opportunity” for a thaw with other Arab states. “Just recently, renewal of formal relations with Oman was declared and the establishment of a representative office of the (Israeli) foreign ministry in that country,” Yossi Cohen told a security conference in Herzliya, near Tel Aviv. “That is only the visible tip of a much broader secret effort,” he said, adding that in addition to Israel´s historic treaties with Jordan and Egypt other Arab countries had discreetly joined “the states of peace, some of them in an unseen manner.” “We do not yet have with them official peace treaties but there is already a communality of interests, broad cooperation and open channels of communication,” he added. Israel and Oman agreed to open trade representative offices in the 1990s, but in 2000 the Gulf sultanate closed them after the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada. Cohen said the current climate presents “an unprecedented opportunity, perhaps the first in the history of the Middle East, to reach a regional understanding which could lead to a comprehensive peace agreement.” The Israeli foreign ministry declined to comment on his remarks. In October, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held surprise talks with Oman´s Sultan Qaboos in Muscat. The recent moves have raised Palestinian fears of a normalisation of ties. Last week Oman said it would open an embassy in the Palestinian territories in support of the Palestinian people, in a first for a Gulf Arab state. The announcement was greeted warily by senior Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi, who warned Oman against using the new embassy as a step towards establishing formal relations with Israel. “If this has a political price attached then certainly there will be ramifications,” she said. Mutual concerns about Shiite Iran have lately highlighted common interests between some Arab countries and Israel. In an apparently unprecedented step, a handful of Israeli journalists invited by the White House flew openly to Bahrain last week for a US-sponsored workshop unveiling economic planks of a broader plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace. The Gulf state has no diplomatic relations with Israel. On Monday the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement that Foreign Minister Israel Katz had visited Abu Dhabi for a UN climate conference, where he met United Nations chief Antonio Guterres and an unnamed “high ranking UAE official”. The United Arab Emirates do not have formal diplomatic ties with the Jewish state but Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev paid a visit to Abu Dhabi in October. The statement did not say when Katz was there but described his visit as the first by a senior Israeli minister since the Bahrain conference.

News article:
Discussions of last week’s Bahrain conference has stressed the point that the conference was designed to deal only with economic issues. It was to be followed by a conference that would be attended by representatives of Israel and the Palestinian Authority at which the political issues would be discussed and, hopefully, a peace agreement would be reached. What appears to have been overlooked is that the Bahrain conference directly addressed the most important political issue in the Israeli/Palestinian dispute, an issue that must be resolved if peace is to be attained: the Palestinian claim of a “right of return.” That is the claim that calls for the mass migration to Israel from the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria of about 40,000 surviving Palestinian refugees from the 1948 and 1967 Arab wars against Israel plus about 5,500,000 children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of Palestinian refugees. All of them are now served by the UN Relief and Works Agency, which keeps them classified as Palestinian refugees, who are deliberately segregated from other members of the Arab communities among which they live. Their mass migration to Israel would end Israel as a majority-Jewish state and thus end the existence of the State of Israel. The claim of a “right of return” is thus designed to attain the long-term objective of the anti-Zionists: the end of a Jewish state in the Middle East. The goal of the Bahrain conference was to make a major initial contribution to the cause of peace. That would be done by providing significant help for the economic development of the above-mentioned five political entities, West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. New job opportunities would be created through investments, totaling $50 billion, that would help all their residents, including the “Palestinian refugees,” who would become fully integrated into the communities in which they have lived for all or most of their lives. Mahmoud Abbas and his colleagues in the Palestinian Authority leadership have rejected the proposed assistance program. They have made it clear that they are not interested in a program designed to provide a better life for the millions of Palestinians who are classified as “refugees” if it means giving up their plan to end the existence of the majority-Jewish state through mass immigration. On the other hand, it appears that the leadership of some Arab states and also some Palestinian businessmen are sympathetic to the Bahrain conference proposals and are indeed prepared to accept the existence of the State of Israel in the Middle East. The question that is open now is whether these supporters of economic progress will be prepared to assert themselves in the period ahead, help keep the basic concept of a two-state solution alive and ultimately lead to its implementation. We’ll have to wait a while and see whether the Bahrain conference does have such positive results. What is clear, however, is that there is no point to entering into a discussion now of borders, the status of East Jerusalem, and other political issues, if the Palestinian Authority continues to insist on its claim of a “right of return.” It should be quite obvious that no government of Israel will sign a peace agreement that embodies a program to end Israel’s existence as a State. It so happens that in the Camp David negotiations of 2000, in which Prime Minister Barak and PLO leader Arafat represented the two sides, President Clinton, in his “Clinton Parameters,” came up with a similar proposal for the “right of return” issue, a proposal which also called for a program of substantial financial assistance to the “Palestinian refugees.” The Parameters made it clear that the proposed peace agreement would not compel Israel to accept Palestinian immigrants based on the “right of return,” but that President Clinton would help get the cooperation of a number of countries throughout the world that would accept Palestinian refugees as immigrants and that he would seek to raise the billions needed to resettle the migrants. As we know, Arafat did not accept the Clinton proposal, which would indeed have provided the two-state solution. In analyzing the problem that we continue to face in any effort to attain an Israeli/Palestinian peace, we need to note that it was close to a hundred years ago that the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al-Husseini developed the ideology of most emphatic rejection of Jewish migration to the Palestinian Mandate. The State of Israel has now been in existence for 71 years, but the Palestinian leadership continues to adhere to al-Husseini’s ideology: no Jewish-majority state. As we in AJIRI have noted, this outlook, which rejects peace, is supported by the UN General Assembly through its annual enactment of the resolutions that extend the mandates of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People (CEIRPP) and the Division for Palestinian Rights (DPR). CEIRPP and DPR are committed to advancing the Palestinian claim of a “right of return.” How, indeed, can we expect the Palestinian leadership to give up a claim that the UNGA endorses year after year? What the outcome of last week’s Bahrain conference demonstrates is that it is critically important for all relevant decision makers on the international scene to understand that to attain an Israeli/Palestinian peace we need a Palestinian leadership that accepts the existence of the State of Israel and gives up the idea of ending Israel’s existence through a large-scale population transfer. Votes against the CEIRPP and DPR would play an important role in achieving that result. That would be an important step forward in realizing the promise of the Bahrain conference.

RAMAT GAN, Israel-Prof. Yitshak Kreiss, director general of Israel's Sheba Medical Center Tel HaShomer, attended the summit in Bahrain, held June 25-26, to discuss economic prospects for the Palestinian people as part of a first step in a potential Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. "I am both privileged and honored to have been personally invited by US. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin to the Peace and Prosperity Workshop in Bahrain," said Prof. Kreiss. Born together with Israel in 1948, Sheba Medical Center is the largest and most comprehensive hospital in the Middle East. The facility treats patients from Israel, the West Bank, Gaza and the entire region indiscriminately. It is a hub for research and innovation, providing cutting-edge care to those across the Middle East and the globe. Sheba was recently named by Newsweek magazine as one of the Top 10 Hospitals in the World. In 2018, for his strong leadership skills and his role in transforming Sheba into Israel's "City of Health," Prof. Kreiss was named the fifth most influential person in Israel by Israeli newspaper The Marker. Prof. Kreiss added: "Sheba Medical Center, the largest hospital facility of its kind, has acted as a 'bridge to peace' to nations in the Middle East region, many of whom who have no diplomatic relations with Israel. Sheba's Israeli Jewish and Arab Moslem and Christian doctors are working side-by-side, providing innovative, critical medical care to thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank. Sheba has also saved the lives of Syrians who were severely injured during the recent civil war, as well as Kurdish Iraqi children in desperate need of heart operations. Medical innovation acts as an engine of growth and an economic bridge to prosperity and healthier lives for everyone." https://www.shebaonline.org/

News article:
Oman's Sultan Qaboos received Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in October 2018 Oman said Wednesday that it will open an embassy in the Palestinian territories in support of the Palestinian people, in a first for a Gulf Arab state. The announcement coincided with a US-led economic workshop in Bahrain to unveil a Middle East peace plan which is not expected to recognise an independent Palestinian state. "In continuation of Oman's support for the Palestinian people, the Sultanate of Oman has decided to open a diplomatic mission at the level of embassy in the State of Palestine," the foreign ministry said on Twitter. A delegation from the ministry will travel to Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, to take the necessary measures to open the embassy, it said. The announcement was cautiously welcomed by a senior Palestinian official. "We think maybe first of all it will help us educate the Omani government as to the real nature of the occupation and also working with Palestine directly," Hanan Ashrawi told journalists. But she warned Oman against using the new embassy as a step towards establishing formal relations with Israel. "If this has a political price attached then certainly there will be ramifications," she said. In Muscat, the Palestinian ambassador to Oman said the opening of an embassy in Ramallah was a "historical decision". "It is an important and indicative step with profound implications, especially at this time, as the Palestinian issue passes through a critical stage," Tayseer Farhat told AFP. "This step represents political and moral support." Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab countries to have established diplomatic ties with the Jewish state. But Oman was the first Gulf state to receive Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in October 2018. A US ally bordering Saudi Arabia and Yemen, Oman has frequently served as a mediator in the Arab world. - Diplomatic role - Elizabeth Dickinson, senior analyst with the International Crisis Group think tank, believes the step by Oman will enhance its diplomatic role. "The good offices of Omani diplomacy have averted regional crises in the past and would be welcome in the Israel-Palestine context," Dickinson told AFP. "Muscat is one of the few remaining regional powers that can truly talk to all sides -- a vitally important role in a moment of such heightened regional tension," she said. Oman is not participating in the Bahrain workshop, where US President Donald Trump's administration hopes to raise $50 billion of investments to improve the economic conditions of Palestinians. The conference is boycotted by the Palestinian Authority, which fears the US administration is dangling money to impose pro-Israeli political solutions. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and adviser, is leading the "Peace to Prosperity" initiative which he called the "Opportunity of the Century" for the Palestinians. But Kushner, a staunch supporter of Israel, said the Palestinians needed to accept the economic framework before any eventual progress on reaching a long-elusive comprehensive peace deal. Last year, Oman's state minister for foreign affairs, Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, held talks with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas in Ramallah. He also made a rare visit by an Arab official to the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque complex in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem. "Now Oman will have a direct presence in Ramallah. Muscat has an uncanny ability to see a middle road when most others are picking sides," Dickinson said. Muscat has previously mediated in regional disputes including US-Iranian tensions and in the conflict in Yemen.

Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz and Bahraini Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa met on Thursday in Washington, D.C. “Yesterday I met publicly with the Foreign Minister of Bahrain @khalidalkhalifa at the [U.S. State Department’s] Ministerial on Religious Freedom Another example of our growing diplomatic connections I will continue to work with [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] to advance Israel’s relations with the Gulf countries,” tweeted Katz. The “meeting was coordinated behind the scenes by the U.S. State Department as part of a conference on religious liberty organized in Washington by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo,” according to an Israeli Foreign Ministry statement, which added that the two ministers “addressed the subject of Iran and regional threats, as well as cooperation between states and agreed to continue … ” Israel and Bahrain do not have formal diplomatic relations, though the two have recently improved ties. However, in June, Al-Khalifa told Israel’s Channel 13 on the sidelines during the June 25-26 “Peace to Prosperity Workshop” in the Bahraini capital of Manama, which jump-started the Trump administration’s Mideast peace plan: “Israel is part of this heritage of this whole region, historically, so the Jewish people have a place amongst us. “That’s why it’s so important and we didn’t want to miss this opportunity, and I want to tell them we should talk.”

News article:
JERUSALEM: Israel´s foreign ministry said Sunday the country will this week host six journalists from Arab countries including, for the first time, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The visit comes as Israel seeks to improve ties with Gulf Arab countries, with which it has no formal diplomatic relations. Those states have resisted offering Israel formal recognition due to its continuing occupation of Palestinian territory, but their relations have warmed of late, largely due to common concerns over Iran. The journalists will visit Jerusalem´s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, parliament and holy sites, among others, the foreign ministry said in a statement. It said it had “the aim of exposing the journalists — some of whom come from countries that do not have diplomatic relations with Israel — to Israeli positions on diplomatic and geopolitical issues”. Jordan is also participating, the ministry said. Jordan is one of only two Arab countries, along with Egypt, that have diplomatic relations with Israel. In another recent sign of a thaw, a group of Israeli journalists attended the US-led economic conference on Israeli-Palestinian peace in the Gulf state of Bahrain in late June.

News article:
Israel often sits at the center of attention in the Middle East, blamed for most of the troubles plaguing the region. But lately, instead of being viewed as the problem, it is slowly gaining more acceptance as being part of the solution. On July 18, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz sent out a surprise post on his Twitter account, including an image of himself with Foreign Minister of Bahrain Khalid Al Khalifa. In the post, Katz wrote: “Yesterday, I met publicly with the Foreign Minister of Bahrain @khalidalkhalifa at the @statedept Ministerial on Religious Freedom. Another example of our growing diplomatic connections.” Such a meeting between a senior Israeli and Arab official, particular from one of the Gulf states, would have been unheard of only a few years ago. And indeed, many were still shocked to see such a public display of relations. Nevertheless, for Israeli experts and insiders, the meeting between Katz and Al Khalifa wasn’t that surprising—just another logical next step in increasingly diverse diplomatic associations between Israel and the larger world. Omer Dostri, a research fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, told JNS that the reason relations between Israel and Bahrain have warmed in recent years is “based on a common interest in curbing the Iranian threat in the fields of military nuclear development, the ballistic-missile project, and Iran’s hostile and subversive activities in the Middle East.” Al Khalifa spoke with Israel’s Channel 13 last month on the sidelines of the Trump administration’s Mideast peace conference in Manama and, amazingly, called for open communication with Israel. In his first-ever interview with an Israeli channel, Al Khalifa said: “Israel is a country in the Middle East. Israel is part of this heritage of this whole region historically. So the Jewish people have a place amongst us. So communication needs to be a prerequisite for solving all the dispute. We should talk.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories At the same time, Bahrain recently confirmed that Manama is preparing to host a meeting on maritime and air-navigation security possibly in October, in cooperation with the United States and Poland, with the participation of more than 60 countries. Israel is likely to be one of them. But does the Gulf state want something from Israel in return for all of this public showcasing? Dostri told JNS he believes that “as part of the development of the relations between the two countries, Bahrain will likely want to see some progress in relations between Israel and the Palestinians.” ‘More outreach between Israel and Gulf states’ Alternatively, Varsha Koduvayur, a senior research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, D.C., told JNS that as of now, Bahrain is not demanding anything for improved relations with Israel. She said, “There’s a growing awareness among Gulf states that Israel will be a good partner and ally for them to bolster regional security against the persistent Iranian threat.” She added that the Persian Gulf states “are also aware of the economic benefits that can be generated by bringing Israel into the fold.” Indeed, earlier this month, the head of the Mossad, Yossi Cohen, announced that Israel was renewing ties with Oman. “Just recently, renewal of formal relations with Oman was declared and the establishment of a representative office of the foreign ministry in that country,” he said. In 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu traveled to Oman, where he held talks with Sultan Qaboos bin Said in Muscat. Looking forward, Koduvayur said she expects “more outreach between Israel and Gulf states,” but that there is a long way to go before any official diplomatic recognition. She said for the time being, that “may be a step too far, given that several Gulf states have publicly tied themselves to supporting the Palestinians. Short of any major improvements in the Israeli-Palestinian issue, I don’t think any Gulf state would be able to normalize with Israel.”

News article:
Topic: Security Region: Middle East Blog Brand: The Buzz Tags: IranMiddle EastMilitaryTechnologyWorld How would they fare? Each packing two 25-millimeter cannons plus machine guns, grenade-launchers and two quadruple mounts for short-range Griffin anti-ship missiles, the Cyclones arguably are the most heavily-armed American warships relative to their size. If the United States and Iran go to war in the Persian Gulf, the U.S. Navy’s smallest warships could be the first to see combat. The Navy’s 13 Cyclone-class patrol boats -- also known as “PCs” for “patrol, coastal” -- each displace just 330 tons of water. An Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, by contrast, displaces more than 9,000 tons of water. A standard crew aboard a Cyclone includes just 28 officers and sailors. Ten Cyclones, operating from a base in Bahrain, comprise America’s naval vanguard in the Persian Gulf. They are the only U.S. warships that permanently operate off the Iranian coast. Other, larger vessels periodically deploy to the region. (This first appeared in June 2019.) The Cyclones are not widely known. Even the Navy in the past has failed to appreciate the 180-foot-long vessels, despite the extreme danger they could encounter during wartime. Congress in 2015 struck the Cyclones from the official tally of around 280 “battle force ships” that the Navy expects to play a major role in a large-scale conflict. Each packing two 25-millimeter cannons plus machine guns, grenade-launchers and two quadruple mounts for short-range Griffin anti-ship missiles, the Cyclones arguably are the most heavily-armed American warships relative to their size. Since acquiring the patrol boats in the mid-1990s until recently, the Navy struggled to find a place for the diminutive vessels in a fleet dominated by much larger, ocean-going aircraft carriers, cruisers and destroyers. The patrol boats lack the range and seakeeping to deploy on their own, so the fleet must hire heavy-lift vessels to haul the tiny warships across oceans. The Cyclones spent a decade in a kind of planning limbo. But then in 2003, the United States invaded Iraq. The patrol boats suddenly found their calling. The waters of the Persian Gulf around Iraq’s sole oil terminal, where tanker ships hook up to load the precious crude, are too shallow for destroyers and cruisers. So to protect the strategic oil facility, the Navy deployed Cyclones. The tiny but hard-hitting boats proved adept at shallow-water patrols. After the reborn Iraqi navy took over oil-terminal protection in the mid-2000s, the Cyclones shifted to more general missions in the waters separating Iraq and Iran. “They are fulfilling long-standing and validated naval missions, functions and tasks, protecting U.S. national interests while providing stabilizing assurance to our allies and partners in a volatile region of the world,” the Navy said of the Cyclones. To better prepare the patrol boats for combat in crowded, chaotic waters, in 2013 the Navy began improving the vessels — adding the Griffin missiles to greatly boost the boats’ firepower. The Cyclones perhaps could outfight many of the gun- and rocket-armed boats and corvettes that make up the bulk of the Iranian navy and the naval militia of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. But any patrol boat lacking serious air-defense systems is vulnerable to shore- and air-launched heavy anti-ship missiles. The Navy plans to keep the Cyclones in service beyond the current five-year planning period that ends in 2024. After that, the fleet should consider replacing the patrol boats with “PC(R)” robotic vessels, Navy lieutenant commander Collin Fox argued in the February 2019 issue of Proceedings, the professional journal of the U.S. Naval Institute. "Medium-displacement unmanned surface vessels are coming to the fleet; but when, how, and what roles they will fill are open questions," Fox writes. "Rather than developing a new MDUSV from scratch, the Navy should take advantage of the requirement to replace the Cyclone-class patrol coastal ships to develop a capable, mature MDUSV—killing two birds with one stone." The new robotic patrol boat could borrow the hull of the Coast Guard’s 350-ton-displacement Sentinel-class cutter, Fox pointed out. The Coast Guard also refers to the Sentinels by their class code “WPC.” “The Navy should latch onto the Coast Guard’s WPC program to acquire a PC(R) that could also serve as a MDUSV development platform and, eventually, a MDUSV,” Fox wrote. “A vessel based on the WPC would take advantage of the Coast Guard’s sunk development costs and production learning curve, while also leveraging multiyear procurement to achieve still greater cost savings.

Each packing two 25-millimeter cannons plus machine guns, grenade-launchers and two quadruple mounts for short-range Griffin anti-ship missiles, the Cyclones arguably are the most heavily-armed American warships relative to their size. If the United States and Iran go to war in the Persian Gulf, the U.S. Navy’s smallest warships could be the first to see combat. The Navy’s 13 Cyclone-class patrol boats -- also known as “PCs” for “patrol, coastal” -- each displace just 330 tons of water. An Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, by contrast, displaces more than 9,000 tons of water. A standard crew aboard a Cyclone includes just 28 officers and sailors. Ten Cyclones, operating from a base in Bahrain, comprise America’s naval vanguard in the Persian Gulf. They are the only U.S. warships that permanently operate off the Iranian coast. Other, larger vessels periodically deploy to the region. (This first appeared in June 2019.) The Cyclones are not widely known. Even the Navy in the past has failed to appreciate the 180-foot-long vessels, despite the extreme danger they could encounter during wartime. Congress in 2015 struck the Cyclones from the official tally of around 280 “battle force ships” that the Navy expects to play a major role in a large-scale conflict. Each packing two 25-millimeter cannons plus machine guns, grenade-launchers and two quadruple mounts for short-range Griffin anti-ship missiles, the Cyclones arguably are the most heavily-armed American warships relative to their size. Since acquiring the patrol boats in the mid-1990s until recently, the Navy struggled to find a place for the diminutive vessels in a fleet dominated by much larger, ocean-going aircraft carriers, cruisers and destroyers. The patrol boats lack the range and seakeeping to deploy on their own, so the fleet must hire heavy-lift vessels to haul the tiny warships across oceans. The Cyclones spent a decade in a kind of planning limbo. But then in 2003, the United States invaded Iraq. The patrol boats suddenly found their calling. The waters of the Persian Gulf around Iraq’s sole oil terminal, where tanker ships hook up to load the precious crude, are too shallow for destroyers and cruisers. So to protect the strategic oil facility, the Navy deployed Cyclones. The tiny but hard-hitting boats proved adept at shallow-water patrols. After the reborn Iraqi navy took over oil-terminal protection in the mid-2000s, the Cyclones shifted to more general missions in the waters separating Iraq and Iran. “They are fulfilling long-standing and validated naval missions, functions and tasks, protecting U.S. national interests while providing stabilizing assurance to our allies and partners in a volatile region of the world,” the Navy said of the Cyclones. To better prepare the patrol boats for combat in crowded, chaotic waters, in 2013 the Navy began improving the vessels — adding the Griffin missiles to greatly boost the boats’ firepower. The Cyclones perhaps could outfight many of the gun- and rocket-armed boats and corvettes that make up the bulk of the Iranian navy and the naval militia of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. But any patrol boat lacking serious air-defense systems is vulnerable to shore- and air-launched heavy anti-ship missiles. The Navy plans to keep the Cyclones in service beyond the current five-year planning period that ends in 2024. After that, the fleet should consider replacing the patrol boats with “PC(R)” robotic vessels, Navy lieutenant commander Collin Fox argued in the February 2019 issue of Proceedings, the professional journal of the U.S. Naval Institute. "Medium-displacement unmanned surface vessels are coming to the fleet; but when, how, and what roles they will fill are open questions," Fox writes.

News article:
AL KHARJ, Saudi Arabia: US Central Command chief Kenneth McKenzie pledged Thursday to work "aggressively" to ensure maritime safety in strategic Gulf waters after a spate of attacks blamed on Iran. "We are currently talking with the international community about the importance of the right of freedom of navigation in the Middle East," McKenzie told reporters at Prince Sultan air base near Riyadh. "We are going to work very aggressively with our partners... to come to a solution that will enable the free passage of critical oil and other commodities... through the region." His comment comes after US General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, last week said the US aims to form a coalition to guarantee freedom of navigation in the Gulf amid fraught relations between Washington and Tehran. Tensions in the area -- through which nearly a third of the world´s oil is transported -- have spiked in recent weeks, with the US blaming Iran for multiple attacks on tanker ships in the region, and Tehran shooting down an American drone. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last month that he hopes more than 20 countries, including the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, would work together on building maritime security. McKenzie said the US was in "exploratory talks" with potential partners to ensure free passage through strategic waterways, including the Strait of Hormuz. This is "not a United States problem, it´s an international problem... We´re eager to be part of an international solution", McKenzie added. He refused to confirm a CNN report that US President Donald Trump´s administration plans to send 500 troops to Saudi Arabia, in what would serve as a show of force to Iran. The troops will be stationed at the Prince Sultan air base, CNN reported, citing two officials at the US Defense Department.

News article:
Iran’s navy chief on Tuesday reportedly said that his country observes all U.S. ships in the Gulf region and archives images of their daily movements. “We observe all enemy ships, particularly [those of] America, point-by-point from their origin until the moment they enter the region,” Rear Adm. Hossein Khanzadi said, according to Reuters. “We have complete images and a large archive of the daily and moment-by-moment traffic of the coalition forces and America.” {mosads}Khanzadi added that Iran will hold joint naval exercises by March 2020 with a select group of unspecified allied countries, Reuters reported. Tensions have heated up between Iran and the U.S. since May, when the Trump administration announced the deployment of a carrier strike group to the region due to unspecified threats from Iran. Last month, the Islamic Republic shot down a U.S. surveillance drone that it claimed had been flying over Iranian airspace. The move nearly prompted a retaliatory strike from the U.S. until President Trump called it off at the last minute. And last week, Trump said a U.S. Navy vessel shot down an Iranian drone in a “defensive action” in the Strait of Hormuz, adding that “this is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters.” The strain has also continued to escalate between the two countries in light of Iran’s breach of two key limits of the 2015 nuclear deal, which Trump withdrew from in 2018 before reimposing harsh sanctions on Iran.

News article:
SEOUL: South Korea is considering sending naval forces to the Strait of Hormuz to help protect international oil shipping from attack, defense authorities said on Monday. “We’re closely watching the situation to brace for various possibilities,” Choi Hyun-soo, a Ministry of National Defense spokeswoman, said. She rejected media claims that Seoul’s decision followed a request by the US government. “We are reviewing various options to help protect our ships sailing through the waters,” she said. However, government sources confirmed that South Korea’s military is preparing to send its anti-piracy unit Cheonghae, now operating off Somalia, to join the US-led maritime coalition in the Gulf. “Technically, no decision has been made. But, practically, yes,” a senior officer of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told Arab News on condition of anonymity. “Given the importance of the alliance with the US, it’s imperative for us to take a role in the coalition,” he said. The officer said that the Cheonghae unit had been trained to protect commercial shipping from a range of threats in and around the Gulf since 2009. The 300-strong unit, which operates from a 4,500-ton KDX-II destroyer carrying a Lynx anti-submarine helicopter, has escorted 21,895 ships and conducted 21 operations to combat piracy off Somalia. “The dispatch of the unit doesn’t require parliamentary approval since it has already been approved for similar roles and missions overseas, which could help minimize controversy in political circles over the sending of troops,” the officer said. Seoul’s presidential office expressed caution about joining the anti-Iran multinational coalition. We’re closely watching the situation to brace for various possibilities. Choi Hyun-soo, Spokeswoman, Ministry of National Defense “Any decision (on sending troops) will be based on national interests,” a presidential spokesman said. Observers said that the Cheonghae unit’s move to the Strait of Hormuz comes at a sensitive time, with Seoul seeking support from the US over its escalating trade dispute with Japan, which has decided to restrict exports of high-tech chip-making materials to South Korea. “The Hormuz dispatch is a litmus test of the evolving South Korean-US alliance, which has been weakening to an extent over issues such as North Korea,” Moon Keun-shik, an analyst at the Korea Defense and Security Forum in Seoul, said. The troop dispatch is also tied up with negotiations between Seoul and Washington over defense cost-sharing. The Trump administration wants Seoul to bear the costs for US troops on South Korean soil. As a result, South Korea agreed to pay $920 million early this year, up from $830 million last year. “South Korea has few options to resist US demands. The dispatch of the Cheonghae unit is an attempt to soothe US officials,” Kim Dae-young, a researcher at the Korea Institute for National Security, said. A long-standing business relationship between Seoul and Tehran adds to the risks facing the South Korean government over possible intervention in regional tensions. “South Korea faces a dilemma in terms of security and economic matters,” Kim said. “Joining the US-led maritime coalition in the Strait of Hormuz would worsen economic ties with Iran. But we cannot sit idle because about 75 percent of oil imports to our country are shipped through the strait.” Tehran was Seoul’s third-largest source of petroleum in 2017 and became the largest supplier of condensates for South Korea’s petrochemical industry. After the US reimposed sanctions in 2018, South Korean imports of Iranian oil declined by 60 percent and were completely suspended this year with the end of US waivers for importing some Iranian oil. In 2018, South Korea secured $5.2 billion in construction contracts with Iran, but most of the contracts have been abandoned. The country’s exports to Iran in the past five months have shrunk by up to 10 times in comparison with the same period last year, reaching just $148 million. In the same period, Iran’s exports to South Korea have declined by 33 percent, reaching $2 billion.

News article:
South Korea plans to join a US-led maritime force in the Middle East by sending a naval unit, which includes a destroyer, to help guard oil tankers sailing through the Strait of Hormuz, a South Korean newspaper reported on Monday.Tensions between Iran and the United States have increased since Washington pulled out of the Iranian nuclear deal last year and reimposed sanctions on Tehran.Attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz off the coast of Iran in recent months further soured ties, prompting US officials to call for allies to join a planned maritime security mission.The Maekyung business newspaper, citing an unidentified senior government official, said South Korea had decided to send the anti-piracy Cheonghae unit operating in waters off Somalia, possibly along with helicopters.Seoul’s defence ministry said the government was exploring measures to protect its ships in the area but no decision had been made.“It is obvious that we have to protect our ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz, isn’t it? So we’re considering various possibilities,” deputy ministry spokesperson Ro Jae-cheon told a regular news briefing on Monday.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week Washington had asked South Korea, Japan, France, Germany, Australia and others to take part.US national security adviser John Bolton visited Seoul last week and discussed the issue with senior officials, including the defence minister, but Ro said there was no official request made during that meeting.The Cheonghae unit has been stationed in the Gulf of Aden since 2009, working to tackle piracy in partnership with African countries as well as the United States and the European Union.The 302-strong unit operates a 4,500-ton destroyer, a Lynx anti-submarine helicopter and three speed boats, according to South Korea’s 2018 defence white paper.

So we’re considering various possibilities,” deputy ministry spokesperson Ro Jae-cheon told a regular news briefing on Monday.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week Washington had asked South Korea, Japan, France, Germany, Australia and others to take part.US national security adviser John Bolton visited Seoul last week and discussed the issue with senior officials, including the defence minister, but Ro said there was no official request made during that meeting.The Cheonghae unit has been stationed in the Gulf of Aden since 2009, working to tackle piracy in partnership with African countries as well as the United States and the European Union.The 302-strong unit operates a 4,500-ton destroyer, a Lynx anti-submarine helicopter and three speed boats, according to South Korea’s 2018 defence white paper.

News article:
SYDNEY, Australia (AFP) — The United States is struggling to piece together an international coalition to protect cargo ships traveling through the Strait of Hormuz, with allies concerned about being dragged into conflict with Iran. Tensions have risen in the Gulf since the United States decided in May 2018 to withdraw from a landmark accord to limit Iran’s nuclear program and began to reintroduce sanctions. But even as a series of ships have been seized in the narrow maritime thoroughfare — vital for the world’s supply of crude — European countries have been reticent about a US plan to send in military escorts. On Sunday, Australia became the latest ally seeming to give the plan a wide berth. Australian defense minister Linda Reynolds told the visiting US secretaries of state and defense that their “very serious” and “complex” request would be given “very serious consideration” — but stopped short of offering a full response. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “We are deeply concerned by the heightened tensions in the region. And we strongly condemn the attacks on shipping in the Gulf of Oman,” said Reynolds. “But we will ultimately, as we always do, decide what is in our own sovereign interests,” she told Mike Pompeo and the newly confirmed Pentagon chief Mark Esper who was on his maiden overseas trip. “And we’ll certainly discuss this issue during our ministerial consultations, but again, no decision has yet been made.” Advertisement Washington floated the idea of a naval coalition in June, after multiple attacks on ships in the Gulf, which the United States had blamed on Iran — but which Tehran denies. The plan was to have each country provide a military escort for their ships, with US military providing a security backstop, monitoring the zone of operations and providing command and control. Pompeo adamant Asked by a reporter about the lack of enthusiasm from Australia, Pompeo was characteristically combative and insisted he was “very confident that we will have a global coalition.” “There’s lots of conversations taking place, amongst all the countries, as with Australia,” he said. Esper, meanwhile, said the United States had gotten “various degrees of response,” adding “I think there’ll be some announcements coming out in the coming days.” Referencing the prospect of European-only cooperation, Esper plaid down a bifurcation of effort. Advertisement “I think the purpose remains the same whether it’s an operation conducted under the United States command and control, or conducted by somebody else, a European partnership. “I think both fulfill the same purpose, a unity of effort with regard to ensuring freedom of navigation.” Paris, Berlin and London plan to coordinate and share information in the Gulf to reinforce maritime security, but without deploying additional assets, according to French Defense Minister Florence Parly. “We are trying to organize ourselves as Europeans, but one thing is certain: our actions will have only one objective, to lower current tensions and defend our interests,” she said. Germany has distanced itself from a military operation in the Strait of Hormuz, considering it could hinder European efforts to reach a diplomatic solution with Iran. German government spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer said last week that the focus should be on “diplomacy and de-escalation,” amid a spike in tensions between the UK and Iran. Declaring the German government “reluctant” to get involved in the US plan she said that “participation in a US-led mission could complicate this issue, even as of course we share the goal of freedom of navigation.” Britain has responded to the seizure of a UK tanker in June by announcing it would escort British-flagged ships and send a second warship to the region.

News article:
Japan is mulling over deployment of the country's Self-Defence Forces to the Gulf of Oman and the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait in order to escort Japanese tankers in the region amid an escalation in tensions in the Middle East, Nikkei reported on Friday. The reports also noted that Tokyo had no plans to join the US mission. Tensions in the Persian Gulf have been on the rise over the past several months. Both Washington and London announced plans to build their own coalitions in order to patrol the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. Later in August, UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace stated that Britain would join a US-led maritime mission, while Germany and other countries plan to establish a European coalition.

News article:
SEOUL: A South Korean anti-piracy naval contingent has been dispatched to the Gulf of Aden on a rotational mission, following speculation that the 300-strong force could join a US-led coalition patrolling the Strait of Hormuz amid tensions with Iran. A ceremony took place on Tuesday for the 30th rotation of the Cheonghae Unit at the port city of Busan. The contingent on board the 4,400-ton destroyer Kang Gam Chan is scheduled to conduct operations to protect vessels off the Somali coast for six months from September. “As of now, the Kang Gam Chan will sail to the Gulf of Aden to carry out its routine mission,” said Defense Ministry spokeswoman Choi Hyun-soo. “We’re reviewing various options of protecting our vessels.” Capt. Lee Sang-keun, head of the 30th rotational batch, said: “We’re fully ready to conduct missions wherever our people need help.” A senior officer of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said on condition of anonymity: “The unit is heading for the Gulf of Aden first, then it could be dispatched to the Strait of Hormuz at the order of command.” But the officer said no formal decision has been made for the unit to join the US-led campaign. According to officials in Seoul, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper raised the issue of South Korea potentially joining the campaign during a one-on-one meeting with his counterpart Jeong Kyeong-doo on Aug. 9. Jeong reportedly expressed support for the US-led initiative to safeguard freedom of navigation, while asking for Washington’s help to resolve a trade feud with Japan. The Trump administration is maintaining its push for allies to join the coalition to protect commercial shipping in the waterway, through which 20 percent of the global oil supply flows. The route is vital for South Korea, as about 70 percent of oil imports come via the waterway. Currently, only the UK and Israel have joined the campaign. Iran has warned that such an international naval presence in the Strait of Hormuz will increase the “risk of combustion” in the region. A day after Esper visited Seoul, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Sayyed Abbas Moussawi urged South Korea to remain neutral, citing economic ties between the two nations. “(South) Korea’s possible joining of the coalition is not a good signal for us, and it will make things complicated,” Moussawi was quoted by the Yonhap news agency as saying. Rep. Kim Jong-dae of the Justice Party expressed concern that Seoul’s possible partaking in the mission would compromise the country’s economic ties with one of the largest oil exporters. “Iran is one of the largest trade partners with South Korea. Are you sending troops to the waters of Iran to protect shipping of oil from Iran? It’s absurd,” the lawmaker said in a news conference at the National Assembly on Wednesday. HIGHLIGHTS • Dispatch follows speculation that it could join US-led coalition patrolling Strait of Hormuz. • The Trump administration is maintaining its push for allies to join the coalition to protect commercial shipping in the waterway. “Once sending forces to the region, we should bear the burden of economic damage. I don’t think we’re prepared for that risk now,” added Kim, a member of the National Assembly’s Defense Committee. “I was told by a military source that the Kang Gam Chan was fitted with underwater search systems to detect torpedoes and mines ... The unit is also known to have recently been involved in training exercises to thwart drone attacks. These are clear steps to prepare for the Hormuz dispatch.” As for whether the destroyer has been armed with new defense equipment, Defense Ministry spokeswoman Choi said: “That is something that can be done depending on the needs at the site. There hasn’t been any big change (in weapons systems).” Some civic groups said the dispatch of the Cheonghae Unit must be approved by Parliament. “The Cheonghae Unit has been sent to the Gulf of Aden for the sake of international peacekeeping, but the Strait of Hormuz is a spot where military tensions between the US and Iran are escalating,” said Park Jin-seok, a member of Lawyers for Democratic Society. “Sending troops to the volatile region is against the law.”

News article:
Australia will join the United States in a security mission to protect merchant vessels travelling through key Middle East waterways after Iran seized a British-flagged vessel, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday. Foremost among the areas to be patrolled is the Strait of Hormuz, between Oman and Iran, through which about one-fifth of the world's seaborne crude flows out of the Gulf. Global commodity trading has been rocked in recent months by the seizure of the British tanker and a series of attacks on international merchant vessels that the U.S. and Britain have blamed on Iran, though it denies involvement. Britain this month became the first U.S. ally to announce its participation. "This destabilising behaviour is a threat to Australia's interests in the region," Morrison told a news conference in Canberra. "Our contribution will be limited in scope and it will be time-bound." Morrison said Australia would send a P-8A Poseidon surveillance plane to the Middle East for one month before the end of 2019, while an Australian frigate would be deployed for six months from January. Australia is a staunch ally of the United States, which in recent months has urged partners to do more for global security. Iran has denounced U.S. efforts to set up the coalition and insisted countries in the region can protect waterways and work towards signing a non-aggression pact. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Wednesday told the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI): "No amount of foreign military presence can prevent insecurity in this region. You cannot have an island of security ... while the U.S. is waging an economic war against Iran." The Gulf state of Bahrain, which hosts the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, this week became the first Arab country to announce it would join the new mission, through a tweet from its ambassador to the United States. The Bahraini government was unable to provide further details when asked by Reuters. Sources briefed on the U.S. plan had told Reuters that foreign participation could include anything from sending vessels and personnel to offering bases, logistical support, liaison officers or financing. Bahrain already serves as headquarters to the U.S.-led Combined Maritime Forces, a 33-nation alliance that carries out security and anti-piracy operations in the region. Israeli media this month quoted Foreign Minister Israel Katz as telling a closed-door meeting that Israel was part of discussions and intelligence-sharing within the new coalition, though Israeli officials declined to confirm or deny this. Katz told Israel's Ynet TV: "In general, Israel is involved in what is happening in the region in everything regarding the confrontation with Iran, putting the brakes on Iran ... The United States, which is spearheading a sanctions policy, certainly sees a partner in Israel." Most European countries, which disagree with a U.S. decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran, have been reluctant to sign up to the U.S.-led mission for fear of adding to tension in the region. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew Washington in 2018 from a big-power deal that had scrapped international sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear programme. Search Keywords: Short link:

WASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump hinted on Monday that his administration could publish some parts of its plan for Middle East peace even before Israel’s September 17 do-over elections. Trump was asked during his meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi, on the sidelines of the G7 conference in France, if the entire plan could be released before the election. “No, of course not,” he replied, echoing a statement he made last week. But he then told journalists that they “may see what the deal looks like before the election." >> Trump’s vile 'disloyalty' smear reflects fury over broken promise of Jewish reward for backing Israel | Analysis He also said that he believes “a deal will happen” because the Palestinians will want his administration to renew the financial aid it had cut off from them over the previous two years. Trump said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s failure to form a coalition government, which caused Israel to go to new elections, had “complicated” his administration’s work on the peace plan. The Trump administration team working on this issue, which is led by Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, was preparing to release the plan after the previous election in April, and was caught by surprise when another election was called. A selective leak or release of parts of the plan before September 17 could help Netanyahu secure an election victory, especially if the parts that will be published will be those more favorable to Israel. In the run-up to the April election, Trump and senior officials in his administration made multiple diplomatic gestures that were seen as advantageous to Netanyahu. Less than a month before Israelis last headed to the polls, Trump invited Netanyahu to the White House for a ceremony in which he recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Trump also featured one of Netanyahu’s campaign posters, which featured a picture of them together, on his own social media accounts. In addition, he publicly praised Netanyahu in a press conference during the election. Trump’s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, also visited Israel during the election, and his itinerary included a publicized visit to the Western Wall alongside the prime minister. In the midst of a challenging campaign marred by the prime minister's corruption charges, nearly all Israeli news outlets offered broad coverage to the Trump administration's gestures towards Netanyahu. When the prime minister was struggling to assemble a government, Trump took to Twitter to say that he hoped a coalition would be formed. After the new election was called, Kushner and the team working with him on the peace plan, which includes Trump’s special envoy Jason Greenblatt, Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and Kushner’s adviser Avi Berkowitz, decided to publish the plan’s economic chapter. The administration also organized a conference in Bahrain focused on the economic future of the region. No Palestinian or Israeli officials participated, although private business executives from Israel and the Palestinian territories arrived independently. The political chapter of the peace plan has not yet been revealed. The Palestinian leadership is convinced that the plan will be heavily tilted towards Israel, and has been boycotting the Trump administration on all levels except for certain security officials since December 2017, when Trump announced his recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and added that he “took Jerusalem off the table."

Tell your friends to sign up for the Daily Kickoff here or for early 7AM access via Debut Inbox JI INTERVIEW — In an interview with JI’s Jacob Kornbluh on Tuesday, Efraim Sneh, former deputy defense minister under Ehud Olmert, expressed concern that President Donald Trump could endorse Israeli annexation in exchange for muted criticism of a new potential Iran deal. “There is a danger” that the Trump administration may announce its support for Israel annexing parts of the West Bank “to compensate” for a possible “rapprochement with Iran,” Sneh said in a phone interview. Sneh noted that he had advocated for flexibility on the Israeli-Palestinian front to help the Obama administration put together a coalition to counter Iran. Today, he said, a “boding rapprochement with Iran — which was now only delicately hinted — can be an incentive to that kind of measure,” he said. “Very dangerous steps by the Israeli government could be endorsed just for this purpose.” Sneh is one of 25 Israeli former defense officials who sent a letter to members of Congress on Tuesday expressing their appreciation for the passage of H. Res. 246, which affirmed “strong support for a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resulting in two states.” [JewishInsider] On the U.S.-Israel relationship: “This administration will do everything needed to help Netanyahu win. There’s a very strong alliance between the close circle of Trump and the close circle of Netanyahu. It’s a political alliance, not a strategic alliance between the two countries. Unfortunately, there is no more bipartisanship support for Israel. It was destroyed. It will be restored only when a different government is formed in Israel.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms On the possibility of war between Israel and Hezbollah: “I think we are in a very combustible situation. But no responsible Israeli government can accept the Iranian entrenchment in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.” Sneh also observed that while it is “critically necessary” for Israel to prevent Iran and Hezbollah from developing targeted missiles, it’s a mistake for Netanyahu to break with Israel’s ambiguity over its strikes against Iranian targets. Sneh predicts that a war between Israel and Iranian proxies is just a matter of time. “If this entrancement will continue, war is unavoidable.” HEARD YESTERDAY — National Security Advisor John Bolton said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that Trump’s willingness to meet with his Iranian counterpart doesn’t suggest he’s softened his stance on Iran. “He’ll meet with anybody to talk. He is a negotiator. He is a dealmaker,” Bolton said. “But talking with them does not imply… changing your position. I think if you look at what President Trump has said about the Iran nuclear deal, which he called the worst deal in U.S. diplomatic history — a view I think is amply justified by the facts — he is not going to make the same mistakes that President Obama made.” Advertisement Iranian-American journalist Jason Rezaian writes: “Like it or not, talks with Iran are coming soon: No matter how hard Trump’s Iran advisers try to demonize the Islamic republic, the regime is still being taken seriously by all the other major world powers… Tehran’s ability to exploit the divide between the United States and the rest of the world should be of grave concern. That growing rift serves to normalize the Iranian regime’s worst behaviors.” [WashPost] ON THE GROUND — Tensions between Israel and its neighboring enemies remained high on Wednesday, after Hezbollah vowed a “surprise” and “calculated” retribution against Israel. The purported strike “is being arranged in a way which wouldn’t lead to a war,” a Hezbollah source told Reuters. “The direction now is for a calculated strike, but how matters develop, that’s another thing.” An Associated Press headline on Tuesday declared that “Israel’s shadow war with Iran bursts into the open.” AP’s Aron Heller wrote that the events of the past few days “have raised tensions at a particularly fraught time. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is looking to project strength three weeks before national elections, while Iran has taken a series of provocative actions in recent months aimed at pressuring European nations to provide relief from crippling U.S. sanctions.” Meanwhile, three Hamas police officers were killed in explosions in Gaza late Tuesday. Israel said it was not involved in the suspected suicide bombings, which are believed to have been carried out by Salafi militants challenging Hamas’s rule. Robert Malley and Naysan Rafati of the International Crisis Group write… “Israel-Iran tensions could threaten prospects for Trump-Rouhani meeting: In the midst of French efforts to de-escalate tensions between Tehran and Washington… the conflict between Israel and Iran may have entered a dangerous new stage… Previous escalations between Iran and Israel in Syria have been contained… The current escalation is drawing in a far wider range of actors and is hitting closer to Iran’s core interests, making it that much more difficult to prevent, contain or control.” [Axios] Seth Frantzman writes… “Israel’s strategy against Tehran: Revealing the Iranian threat: Air strikes on Iran’s network of proxies force the network out of the shadows. It can’t hide in villas in southern Syria, or launch drones at night, or stockpile ballistic missiles in Iraq if it is looking over its shoulder and increasingly making mistakes through its aggressive and open threats. Iran is used to playing a double game of moderates and hard-liners, sending its smiling foreign minister to the recent G7 while boasting of its allies’ drone technology striking Saudi Arabia.” [NationalReview] Advertisement Jonathan Spyer writes: “The Iran-Israel war is here: This war is a very 21st-century affair. For now it involves only small circles among the Israeli and Iranian populations… But it won’t necessarily stay that way. A single kinetic and successful Iranian response to Israel’s airstrikes could rapidly precipitate an escalation to a much broader contest. State-to-state conflict has returned to the Middle East.” [WSJ] TALK OF THE CITY — A 64-year-old hassidic Jewish man was brutally attacked with a rock at a park in Crown Heights yesterday. Rabbi Avraham Gopin was walking through Brooklyn’s Lincoln Terrace Park when a man threw a rock at him. Gopin approached the man, who punched him in the face and then hit him with another rock, knocking out several of his front teeth. The NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force is investigating the attack, and released videofootage of the alleged attacker. New York City Councilman Chaim Deutsch (D-Brooklyn) told JI’s Jacob Kornbluh on Tuesday that New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is spending too much time on the campaign trail and not devoting enough attention and resources to the surge of violent antisemitic attacks in Brooklyn. “Whether he is here or not, de Blasio should make sure that his administration is on top of things, especially when he had made that commitment to open [a mayoral hate crimes] office in June,” Deutsch said. “We are in a moment where we need to tackle these issues head on. We can’t just ignore them thinking it’s going to go away. The mayor needs to realize that if he makes a commitment, he needs to make good on it.” In June, de Blasio declared the immediate opening of a mayoral office to combat the rise in antisemitism, which “will work to root out hate and make our streets safer.” But little action appears to have been taken since then. “We are already in August, and I still haven’t heard anything about it being active or anyone being hired,” Deutsch said. “The commitment was made by the mayor that he’s going to have this open by June. We are waiting for this [to be] implemented.” [JewishInsider] On Tuesday, de Blasio tweeted that “the NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force is investigating this despicable act of violence, and we will find the attacker. This city will stop at nothing to protect our communities from hate and violence.” TALK OF THE NATION — Incoming Harvard freshman deported after visa revoked — by Shera S. Avi-Yonah and Delano R. Franklin:“U.S. officials deported [Ismail B.] Ajjawi, a 17-year-old Palestinian resident of Tyre, Lebanon, Friday night shortly after he arrived at Boston Logan International Airport. Before canceling Ajjawi’s visa, immigration officers subjected him to hours of questioning — at one point leaving to search his phone and computer — according to a written statement by Ajjawi. University officials are currently working to resolve the matter before classes begin on Sept. 3, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an email.” [TheCrimson; WashPost] Advertisement TOP TALKER — New York Times columnist Bret Stephens deactivated his Twitter account on Tuesday after inviting David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at The George Washington University — who called him a ‘bedbug’ — to his home to meet his wife and kids and insult him to his face. “Time to do what I long ago promised to do,” he wrote. “Twitter is a sewer. It brings out the worst in humanity. I sincerely apologize for any part I’ve played in making it worse, and to anyone I’ve ever hurt.” Stephens defended his action in an interview on MSNBC Live with Stephanie Ruhle: “Analogizing people to insects is always wrong. We can be better… There’s a bad history of being analogized to insects that goes back to a lot of totalitarian regimes in the past.” Karpf responded to Stephens in Esquire: “No one has freer speech than a public intellectual with a regular column in the paper of record. Stephens is free to say whatever he wants. With that freedom comes the discomfort that people will disagree with you. If Stephens is going to have this social power, he is going to have to learn to wield it more responsibly.” [Esquire] George Washington University’s provost, Forrest Maltzman, invitedthe Times columnist for a campus discussion on civil discourse. Stephens toldThe Washington Post that he accepted the invitation “and we will find a date in the fall.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) mocked Stephens in a tweet: “Imagine being on Twitter and having the worst thing you’re called in a given day is ‘bedbug.’ My own friends roast me harder than that

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to arrange "a dramatic diplomatic gesture" from US President Donald Trump to help him win the upcoming Israeli election, reported Haaretz. According to the paper, recent weeks have seen "intensive talks" between Netanyahu's advisers and people close to Trump "over a potential statement by the American president, in which he could commit to protecting Israel in the future from any existential threat". The idea of a presidential statement was reportedly "born out of the broader initiative of creating a 'defence pact' between the United States and Israel", said Haaretz, a pact "under discussion since the 1990s" but never implemented. While "discussions on the subject have been revived" in recent months, signing such a pact "would require the involvement of the Pentagon and other US government agencies", with negotiations potentially lasting for months. READ: Netanyahu seeks Trump go-ahead for Israel's West Bank annexation to help win election The chances of completing such an agreement before the 17 September elections, therefore, are "almost non-existent". Meanwhile, the pact also has its opponents amongst Israeli military officials both past and present, which could present Netanyahu with a problem. #IsraElex19: Israeli Elections 2019 Everything you need to know >> Other options apparently being discussed include a "joint announcement about the start of negotiations over a future defence pact". This would "help Netanyahu politically in the short-term and could also help Trump as the president strives to present himself as Israel's greatest supporter." Another potential "gesture" is "a presidential statement by Trump that the United States under his leadership will help Israel militarily in any case of a future existential threat". Last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked in a radio interview if the US would support Israel during a military conflict. READ: US will act if Iranian tanker tries to deliver oil to Syria says Pompeo "We're constantly in conversations about that, making sure that we collectively have defence systems capabilities that are appropriate for their needs," he replied. "I have every confidence this president, who moved our embassy and who made clear Israel's rights in the Golan Heights, will do all that is necessary to ensure that our great partner in Israel will be protected."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in talks with President Trump for a diplomatic gesture designed to help boost Netanyahu’s election bid ahead of the Sept. 17 Israeli election. According to Haaretz, the two leaders’ advisers have discussed a statement from Trump in which he pledges to safeguarding Israel against any future threat to its existence. Netanyahu is also reportedly in talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin for a similar gesture, such as an official visit to Israel or a meeting of the three countries’ national security advisers, according to the outlet. {mosads}An official defense pact between Israel and the U.S. has been under discussion since the 1990s but never solidified, though the idea has come into focus again in recent months.

News article:
Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) said he would work with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he’s elected president, voicing openness to working with a leader criticized by many Democrats. “I would do everything I could to work with Prime Minister Netanyahu if he is in power and if I am lucky enough to serve as president, and to support the U.S.-Israel relationship,” O’Rourke said in an interview with Haaretz published Thursday. {mosads}Several 2020 Democrats have panned Netanyahu over his policies regarding the Palestinians, with O’Rourke blasting him as “racist” in April and saying, “We must be able to transcend his current leadership.” The Texas Democrat doubled down on his support for the two-state solution this week, noting that his potential efforts to work with Netanyahu are “not mutually exclusive to ensuring that the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people is not compromised or undermined or ended all together.” “It is the only way that I think you achieve those goals of human dignity and security, self-determination and the safety that people should be able to depend on in their day-to-day lives,” he told Haaretz. While the relationship between Washington and Jerusalem continues to enjoy bipartisan support in Washington, Netanyahu in particular has come under withering criticism from Democrats over the ongoing occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The prime minister was further criticized for his recent decision to block Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) from visiting Israel over the support for the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. Across the aisle, Netanyahu has seen his stock among the GOP rise due to his close relationship with President Trump. Jerusalem scored significant wins after Trump declared last year the U.S. would move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to the capital city and recognized Israeli sovereignty over the disputed Golan Heights this year.

News article:
Jason Greenblatt, a key architect of President Donald Trump's troubled Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, announced his resignation Thursday. His departure places another question mark over the much-delayed initiative, which the White House has touted as the "opportunity of the century," but has yet to see the light of day and has been rejected in advance by the Palestinians. Greenblatt, who worked for two and a half years alongside Trump's powerful son-in-law Jared Kushner, said in a statement that his plan had been "a vision for peace." Kushner lauded him as someone "trusted and respected by all of the leaders throughout the region." A senior administration official said Greenblatt was going to spend more time with his family but left on good terms and "holds the confidence of the president." For all the warm words, Greenblatt's departure only adds to the sense that Trump's promise to transform the US approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is floundering. Just a week ago, Greenblatt signaled the latest pushback to the plan's unveiling, saying it would not be released until after Israel's September 17 election, which will decide whether Trump ally Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stays in power. Ilan Goldenberg, a Middle East negotiator in former US president Barack Obama's government, said another election -- the US presidential polls in November next year -- could be the real reason for a hold up. "Let me translate this for you," he tweeted after Greenblatt's announcement. "Kushner's Mideast peace plan will not see the light of day before November 2020 if at all (my bet is on never)." 'Good riddance' Trump has repeatedly boasted that he is the most pro-Israeli US president in history. He has slashed aid to the Palestinians, while making big concessions to the Israelis, including formalizing US recognition of the divided city of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. According to the Republican, his concept for ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict revolves around encouraging massive economic investment, hoping that money will speak louder than political divides. However, Palestinian leaders have dismissed the plan as one-sided and failing to address their wish to end Israeli occupation and the expansion, encouraged by Netanyahu, of Jewish settlements on Palestinian land. Greenblatt "was an apologist for the most extreme, hardline government in the history of Israel," Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestinian official, told AFP. "Nobody ever saw him as evenhanded or neutral in any way. He was totally committed not to peace but to the justification of all Israeli violations," she said. "I think the Palestinians as a whole are going to say good riddance." Critics of the Trump push have also criticized his choice of key personnel: Kushner and Greenblatt, a former lawyer for Trump's businesses, are both Orthodox Jews and have long ties to Israel, but no previous foreign policy or diplomatic experience. One of the aides tapped by the White House on Thursday to fill Greenblatt's shoes, Avi Berkowitz, only graduated from Harvard Law School in 2016. 'Vision' Israeli authorities, however, were sorry to see Greenblatt go. Netanyahu thanked Greenblatt "for his dedicated work for security and peace and for never hesitating to tell the truth about the state of Israel to its detractors." A senior Trump administration official echoed that sentiment, underlining Greenblatt's role in the steadily intensifying nature of Washington's support for Israel. "Jason was instrumental, together with others in the administration, when the president recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, and recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights," the official said. "Jason has also been instrumental in helping to reframe the discussions about the conflict, using the approach that a real peace can only be built on truth." The question is when Greenblatt's plan will finally emerge and whether it will gain traction. According to the White House official, "the vision is now complete and will be released when appropriate."

News article:
Jason Greenblatt, a key architect of President Donald Trump's troubled Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, announced his resignation Thursday. His departure places another question mark over the much-delayed initiative, which the White House has touted as the "opportunity of the century," but has yet to see the light of day and has been rejected in advance by the Palestinians. Greenblatt, who worked for two and a half years alongside Trump's powerful son-in-law Jared Kushner, said in a statement that his plan had been "a vision for peace." Kushner lauded him as someone "trusted and respected by all of the leaders throughout the region." A senior administration official said Greenblatt was going to spend more time with his family but left on good terms and "holds the confidence of the president." For all the warm words, Greenblatt's departure only adds to the sense that Trump's promise to transform the US approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is floundering.

News article:
While in Argentina on Thursday, first daughter Ivanka Trump responded to the sudden resignation news of the administration's Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt by talking up the peace plan that Greenblatt played a heavy role in designing along with her husband Jared Kushner. Asked if Greenblatt's departure would affect the yet-to-be-released Middle East peace plan, Trump replied to Bloomberg senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs: "No." The president's daughter and senior White House adviser said Greenblatt's exit had been planned "for some time" and that his job was hard on his six children. "We love Jason, so he's always additive to the team," Trump said. "But the plan's in a great place." Trump declined to comment further, telling Jacobs it was the "wrong trip." “No,” Ivanka told me in Argentina when I asked if Greenblatt exit will affect peace plan. Departure planned “for some time.” Job hard on his 6 kids. “We love Jason, so he’s always additive to the team. But the plan’s in a great place.” She wouldn’t say more. “Wrong trip.” https://t.co/h7Y5ASJTWd — Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) September 5, 2019 President Donald Trump on Twitter Thursday morning announced that Greenblatt "will be leaving to pursue work in the private sector" after nearly three years with the administration and said "Jason has been a loyal and great friend and fantastic lawyer." "His dedication to Israel and to seeking peace between Israel and the Palestinians won't be forgotten," the president continued. "He will be missed. Thank you Jason!" The special envoy for Middle East peace has worked hand-in-hand with senior White House adviser Kushner on the peace plan since early 2017. But its release has been long delayed, most recently due to Israel's September 17 election in which the country's longest-serving prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is up for reelection. Greenblatt has traveled with Kushner to the Middle East to gather support for the plan, the details of which have not been revealed. Palestinian leaders so far have voiced disapproval of the proposal. Like Kushner, Greenblatt lacked government experience before joining the Trump administration. But Greenblatt, who was a top lawyer for the Trump Organization, made a positive impression on Israeli and Palestinian leaders at the start of his service as an envoy. The date of Greenblatt's departure and whether he will still be with the administration if and when the plan is unveiled, remains unclear. Kushner stated that Greenblatt "has done a tremendous job leading the efforts to develop an economic and political vision for a long sought after peace in the Middle East," and said that Greenblatt will continue to be a "close friend and partner." Ivanka Trump, promoting the administration's Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative in South America this week, often defends her husband when he faces criticism.

News article:
Jason Greenblatt, a key architect of President Donald Trump's much-delayed Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, announced his resignation Thursday. Greenblatt, who worked alongside Trump's powerful son in law Jared Kushner, said in a statement it had been "the honor of a lifetime" to work in the White House. A senior administration official said Greenblatt was going to spend more time with his family but left on good terms and "holds the confidence of the president." His departure places another question mark over the troubled plan, which Trump has touted as the "deal of the century," but has yet to see the light of day and has been rejected in advance by the Palestinians. Just a week ago, Greenblatt signalled the latest pushback to the plan's unveiling, saying it would not be released until after the September 17 Israeli election that will decide whether Trump ally Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stays in power. Trump has repeatedly boasted that he is the most pro-Israeli US president in history. He has slashed aid to the Palestinians, while making big concessions to the Israelis. According to the Republican, his vision for ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict revolves around encouraging massive economic investment. However, Palestinian leaders have dismissed the plan as one-sided and failing to address their wish to end Israeli occupation. Netanyahu said after news of Greenblatt's departure that he thanked him "for his dedicated work for security and peace and for never hesitating to tell the truth about the state of Israel to its detractors." Trump tweeted that Greenblatt "has been a loyal and great friend and fantastic lawyer." However, Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestinian official, told AFP: "I think the Palestinians as a whole are going to say good riddance."

News article:
US puts Kushner's 'coffee boy' in charge of Mideast peace Iran Press TV Sun Sep 8, 2019 06:09PM US President Donald Trump's new Middle East envoy is a 30-year-old White House administrative assistant who used to run errands and get coffee for his son-in-law Jared Kushner, a new report states. Trump announced Thursday that Avi Berkowitz will replace former envoy Jason Greenblatt, who announced his resignation the day before. A Harvard Law School graduate who finished his studies in 2016, Berkowitz has zero foreign policy experience except for being Kushner's right-hand-man. He also joined the Trump campaign in 2016. The Business Insider, in a 2017 article, quoted former White House spokeswoman Hope Hicks as saying that Berkowitz's main duties had been "daily logistics like getting coffee and coordinating meetings" as Kushner's close aide. A former employer of the new man in charge of America's Middle East peace efforts also said on Twitter that he was "not very impressive and needed significant hand-holding to handle even simple assignments. But Mideast peace? I'm sure he's got this!" A Middle East expert described Berkowitz as "a glorified intern," according to the Telegraph. Jasmine El-Gamal, a former Middle East advisor to the Pentagon said the appointment shows the Trump administration's "lack of seriousness" in their plans to broker peace in the Middle East. "They are not even pretending otherwise by hiring a qualified person as an envoy," she told the British media outlet. Berkowitz's background as a Zionist, a trait he shares with both Kushner and Greenblatt, has also raised concerns in various political circles. The young diplomat inherits America's so-called "deal of the century" peace deal, which was masterminded by Kushner and Greenblatt as the ultimate solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The deal, which has already been rejected by the Palestinians and the international community, seeks to do away with Palestinian's right to statehood in exchange for basic economic opportunities. Berkowitz and Kushner's Zionist affiliations only lays bare the inherent bias that comes with any US-brokered peace talks between Palestine and the Tel Aviv regime. Washington showed that it does not even care enough to hide the bias, as Trump thanked Greenblatt for his "dedication to Israel" upon his departure. The Telegraph cited experts as saying that Berkowitz could be a disposable player that the Trump administration has brought on board only to kick out later in order to save face in the event of the peace deal's anticipated failure. Upon the unveiling of the deal of the century's first installment at a conference in Bahrain in June, which was boycotted by Palestinian officials, Kushner's creation was met with widespread criticism. "I would give this so-called plan a C- from an undergraduate student," said Daniel Kurtzer, a former US ambassador to Israel. Kushner is expected to drop the next, political phase of the plan soon, shortly after Israel's election on September 17. NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

President Trump tweeted on Saturday that he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone to talk about a potential defense treaty between Israel and the United States after the upcoming Israeli elections. Trump said the deal "would further anchor the tremendous alliance between our two countries." ....between our two countries.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 14, 2019 "I look forward to continuing those discussions after the Israeli Elections when we meet at the United Nations later this month!" he added. The U.S. and Israel are close military allies, and the Pentagon regularly sends $4 billion to Jerusalem for military funding each year. Trump and Netanyahu have also become close friends since the beginning of Trump's presidency, and the White House has publicly backed Netanyahu's political aspirations. It was during the first two years of Trump's time in office that the U.S. Embassy was moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which was praised by the Netanyahu regime but criticized by Palestine and its supporters. "Thank you my dear friend President @realDonaldTrump. The Jewish State has never had a greater friend in the White House. I look forward to our meeting at the UN to advance a historic Defense Treaty between the United States and Israel," Netanyahu said in response to Trump's tweet. Thank you my dear friend President @realDonaldTrump. The Jewish State has never had a greater friend in the White House. I look forward to our meeting at the UN to advance a historic Defense Treaty between the United States and Israel. — Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) September 14, 2019 The phone call between the two leaders came just days before Israel's elections, and Netanyahu is currently in a deadlock with two centrist candidates. The prime minister has advocated national security concerns in recent days as a final campaign push, and he has floated ideas like annexing portions of the West Bank and saying more leftist candidates would leave Israel vulnerable to attacks. Former Israel Defense Forces chief and Netanyahu rival Benny Gantz has said a defense treaty with the U.S. would be a "serious mistake." "Such an agreement would be a serious mistake for the State of Israel’s security because a mutual defense treaty requires us to coordinate our security with the United States," Gantz said at a conference in Israel earlier this month. "This is not what we want," Gantz continued. "We haven’t asked anyone to be killed for our sakes, we haven’t asked anyone to fight for us, and we haven’t asked anyone for the right to defend the State of Israel." Netanyahu won reelection to a fifth term as prime minister in April, but he was forced into another election after he could not assemble a ruling coalition.

© Reuters / Nir Elias even if Israel decides to attack What I'm concerned about is that with someone like Netanyahu it will actually commit us even more to going into a conflict that he may drag us into. The US and Israel are discussing a mutual defense treaty that would further cement the already "tremendous" alliance between the two countries, President Donald Trump has revealed."I had a call today with Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss the possibility of moving forward with a Mutual Defense Treaty, between the United States and Israel, that would further anchor the tremendous alliance between our two countries," Trump tweeted.Trump voiced not-that-veiled support for Benjamin Netanyahu ahead of the upcoming parliamentary elections in Israel."I look forward to continuing those discussions after the Israeli Elections when we meet at the United Nations later this month!" Trump wrote.The support surely comes in handy, as Netanyahu's backing appears to be quite shaky. The September 17 polls are the second snap legislative elections this year after Netanyahu failed to form the government back in April.The outcome of the upcoming vote is hard to predict, as Netanyahu's party, Likud, has almost equal support as their main opponent the Blue and White led by Benny Gantz, opinion polls show.Forging a proper US-Israel alliance won't be that great a step, since, former Pentagon official Michael Maloof believes."In one sense, it would commit the United States to Israel's defense,, let's say, for example, Iran, then we will be committed to back them up without any hesitation.

"Even without a piece of paper, the United States would come to Israel's assistance, if it was physically attacked en masse."Trump's decision to announce such plans just a few days before the Israeli elections is not a coincidence, Maloof noted, andRelations between Washington and Tel Aviv have always been quite cozy - and got even closer under Trump -Israel was one of the first major non-Nato ally (MNNA), a designation that goes with a whole set of benefits, such as generous loans, a priority in delivery of various military surplus, possession of war reserve stocks of Pentagon-owned hardware outside US military bases (Israel is said to have at least six sites) and others.Yet in 2014 the US enshrined Israel into a new class of ally - a major strategic partner. The new designation, which is a step above MNNA,. It greatly expanded the US wartime stockpiles in Israel from $200 million in value to a whopping $1.8 billion.Under the Trump administration, the trend has continued, and in 2017, the US established its first permanent military base - an air defense facility - in Israel.If the mutual defense treaty between the two countries fleshes out, it would be the first such deal for Washington in decades..

Still, US officials dusted off the deal earlier this year amid attempts to overthrow the Venezuelan government.

The outgoing US envoy to the Middle East Jason Greenblatt met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, days after elections that left the Israeli leader’s political future in doubt. Greenblatt is the architect of the Trump administration’s long-awaited Middle East peace plan, which has raised widespread skepticism and has already been dismissed by the Palestinians. Netanyahu and Greenblatt were joined by US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, and by Israeli Ambassador to the US Ron Dermer. Neither Netanyahu nor Greenblatt delivered public remarks after their meeting, held Friday afternoon at the Prime Minister’s Residence in Jerusalem. The office of Blue and White chairman Benny Gantz said Friday evening that the US embassy had contacted them and requested to schedule a meeting with Netanyahu’s rival for the premiership. A date has not yet been set. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Earlier a spokesman for Gantz had denied media reports that Greenblatt and Gantz would convene, saying there had never been an invite to meet, though “we would be happy to meet when the opportunity arises.” Netanyahu and Greenblatt’s meeting took place three days after the Israeli elections, which failed to produce a clear winner. Both Netanyahu and Gantz seek to secure the premiership despite neither having a clear path to a stable governing coalition. The administration of US President Donald Trump had said it would release its long-anticipated plan for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal shortly after the September 17 election, though no date had been set. Advertisement But Israel’s election deadlock could complicate its plans. Israel has had a transitional government since the end of 2018, when the Knesset dissolved ahead of election held on April 9. Those elections did not produce a majority coalition for Netanyahu, and the prime minister, rather than risk letting Gantz try to muster a majority instead, pushed through a vote to again dissolve parliament, triggering Tuesday’s election and more political paralysis. Under Israeli law and precedent, a transitional government, such as the one Netanyahu has now headed for nine months, is limited in terms of its capacity to take far-reaching decisions that would deeply affect the future of the state. For example, ahead of Tuesday’s vote, Netanyahu promised to immediately annex the Jordan Valley area — about 25% of the West Bank – if he were able to build a new coalition. He would almost certainly not be allowed to do that were he to attempt it amid the current post-election deadlock. In an interview published Wednesday, Greenblatt said the administration had not yet decided whether it will unveil the plan during or after the current coalition negotiations. “It’s too soon to tell. How will the election affect the plan? Our plan is different than what people have been talking about for so many years. We think we listened very hard to Israelis, Palestinians, the region, just about every expert.” Earlier this month, Greenblatt announced his intention to quit his position shortly after the plan is unrolled. He later clarified that he may stay on longer to see the peace proposal through. “Although I have announced my departure, I am trying to stay until the plan is launched,” Greenblatt told an event in New York, according to Jewish Insider. “If the plan is launched soon, I will stay. And if the plan is launched and we get traction, I hope to stay longer — and I have my family’s support for it.” Advertisement Greenblatt, a former lawyer with the Trump Organization, has been working for the last two and a half years on the administration’s peace plan together with the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. The White House announced on September 5 that the envoy would be stepping down to return to New Jersey to be with his wife and six children. Greenblatt will be replaced by Avi Berkowitz, a senior aide to Kushner who has been present at many of the meetings and discussions related to the peace proposal.

Outgoing U.S. envoy to the Middle East Jason Greenblatt met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, amid negotiations over a unity government in the wake of Israel's election. Also in attendance were U.S. Ambassador David Friedman and Israel's Ambassador to the U.S. Ron Dermer. Neither Netanyahu nor Greenblatt delivered public remarks following the meeting. Kahol Lavan leader Benny Gantz's bureau confirmed that the U.S. Embassy had contacted it to set a meeting between Greenblatt and the former army chief of staff during the former's visit to Israel, adding that "the time of meeting will be agreed upon later." >> Read more: Israel election results: Live updates ■ The road not taken: The dilemma facing Trump's mideast peace team Following the meeting Greenblatt tweeted: "Honored to meet today with Prime Minister Netanyahu. We discussed the incredibly strong U.S.-Israel relationship, regional issues and the peace effort." A U.S. Embassy official said Thursday that Greenblatt was in Israel to hold "discussions with various parties regarding the U.S.-Israel relationship, regional dynamics and the Administration’s peace efforts.” Open gallery view From left to right: David Friedman, Jason Greenblatt, Benjamin Netanyahu, Ron Dermer, in a meeting at the PM's residence in Jerusalem, September 20, 2019 Credit: Matty Stern / U.S. Embassy Jerusalem Israeli officials said the purpose of Greenblatt's visit isn't to publish the Israeli-Palestinian peace plan that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has been working on, but rather "to continue to look into" when would be the best timing to unveil it. In early September Greenblatt announced his resignation, which will go into effect in the coming weeks, after his two-and-a-half-year tenure. The Trump administration has stressed that Greenblatt's departure will not impact intentions to release its peace plan after Israel's election. In recent weeks, as part of his election campaign, Netanyahu repeatedly reiterated that Trump's plan will be presented immediately after the election and would pose a "challenge" to Israel. Netanyahu used this as a justification for his declaration that he would annex the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea, should he be reelected, as well as the move to green light a West Bank settlement days before the election. Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit had objected to Netanyahu's recognition of the settlement close to Jericho, but walked back his objection after he said that he was presented with important details concerning the peace plan. "President Trump said that after the election he will present his peace plan, immediately after the election, even several days after the election, and it's right around the corner. This poses a big challenge to us and it also presents us with a big opportunity. It will be a historic opportunity, a rare window of opportunity to apply Israeli sovereignty on our communities in Judea and Samaria as well as on communities that are important to our tradition and future," Netanyahu said during his annexation declaration last week. "The important question facing us in this election is who will handle the negotiations with Trump, who will enlist him to our cause, who will be the next prime minister of Israel — myself or Gantz and Lapid. Gantz and Lapid said that they would uproot 80,000 settlers. With me, no one will get uprooted," Netanyahu added. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

News article:
Tel Aviv- Asharq Al-Awsat The US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, denied there was a crisis or differences in relations between US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Friedman denied there has been a rift in US-Israeli relations recently, neither on a personal level between Netanyahu and Trump, nor on the level of the two countries. He said Trump's plan to settle the Palestinian issue, “deal of the century,” would be announced later in 2019 when Israel was ready. Speaking to Israel's Jerusalem Post (JP), Friedman said the plan would make Israel stronger, safer, and satisfy all its supporters, regardless of their religious affiliations. The Ambassador said he was very confident the deal will be announced in 2019, without specifying an exact date, noting that its announcement was delayed because of the Israeli elections. The right-wing newspaper asked the Ambassador what he thought of Netanyahu's statements, ahead of the elections, in which he said he intended to annex Jordan’s al-Aghwar and north of the Dead Sea to Israel. Friedman said the US administration prefers to deal with the annexation in a comprehensive framework without limitations. Also, the Jerusalem Post asked Friedman about US silence after Trump recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights and Netanyahu's announcement that he would annex the Jordan Valley if re-elected. “We like to approach all these issues holistically, and hopefully we will have a chance to do so. In the interim, the statements made by the prime minister are ones we don’t see as being inconsistent with a political solution, and so we kind of held our tongue because there was really nothing that called for comment beyond what we said.” The envoy noted that from the US perspective, it wants to deal with all these issues in the context of an overall “resolution of the conflict, rather than piecemeal.” Asked about an Israeli-US Security pact, Friedman asserted that any comments on it were “premature”, noting that conceptually it would be limited, at least on the Israeli side. “An attack on Israel could provoke an overwhelming response by the strongest nation on earth. Beyond that, what are Israel’s obligations, how does it work, how does it impact on freedom of operation – the details really have to be sorted through and [then] people can assess whether it is a good or a bad idea.” The Ambassador was harshly criticized taking a sledgehammer and inaugurating the City of David’s Pilgrimage Road under Palestinian homes. However, he told JP he was very proud of that move and completely comfortable with what had happened. The envoy went on to say that he understood the Palestinian perspective and Palestinians had every right to their wishes, political aspirations, beliefs, and their personal narratives. However, he claimed they “don’t have a right to their own facts… To resent the fact that science has corroborated what most of us already knew, I’m not sympathetic to that grievance.”

Related Finance ministry reveals new amendments to customs law Egypt's finance minister Mohamed Maait affirmed on Monday the keenness of the government on promoting international cooperation to cut down the time needed for customs clearance, rationalizing custom duties and toughening up supervision on customs outlets. The aforementioned measures would contribute to improving the international trade movement and place to a higher level Egypt's rank by the World Bank. "A set of agreements on the Mutual Administrative Assistance in Customs Matters will be signed with some countries in the coming period," the minister said in statements. These agreements come to ensure the establishment of bilateral cooperation in the accurate assessment of goods, to determine taxes and customs duties, implement customs laws and identify prohibited goods such as weapons and narcotics and to address customs violations, the minister explained. The Egyptian Customs Authority, in cooperation with the US Customs Administration, finalized the draft of the preliminary agreement on "mutual assistance in customs matters" between Egypt and the US in preparation for referral to the competent authorities to review and take the necessary measures towards putting it into effect. The cooperation agreement with Belarus is expected to be signed during the sixth session of the Egyptian-Belarus Economic Committee, which will be held in September in the Belarus capital, Maait added. Maait explained the initial formula will be reviewed before referral to the competent authorities to take the necessary measures towards its entry into force. The minister pointed out that coordination is currently underway with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Trade and Industry to start a round of negotiations with the EU on the mechanisms to provide information on goods exchanged between the two sides (brand, value and country of origin).

Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said he looks forward for the 7th Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD7), and all possible meetings with other strategic African partners in enhancing the joint efforts to reach the development goals in the continent. TICAD7 will be held between August 28-30 in Yokohama, Japan, under the theme “Africa and Yokohama, Sharing Passion for the Future.” More than 4,500 heads of state and governments, as well as representatives of international and regional organizations, civil societies, NGOs, and the private sector are expected to attend. TICAD has been, since its launch in 1993, one of the key forums of various partners in support for Africa and its development aspirations, said the President in a message posted on the website of the Japanese Foreign Ministry. Sisi noted that the integration in Africa has been going on tangibly over the past two decades since the establishment of the African Union (AU). He added that launching the Africa Agenda 2063 and the Free Trade Zone in Africa are milestones in African efforts to reach the aspired regional and economic integration in the continent. Over the past years, the AU has succeeded in formulating a number of targets on the Africa Agenda 2063 and give priority to development projects in the continent which help achieve sustainable development, he indicated. Sisi asserted that TICAD7 would continue to focus on Africa's needs and priorities and use points of strength of its partners.

News article:
African countries highlight investment opportunities across the continent at the seventh Tokyo International Conference on African Development, Samia Fakhry reports from Yokohama The seventh round of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD 7) opened yesterday as international attention increasingly focuses on development in Africa. President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi is attending the conference, in his capacity as the current chair of the African Union, at the invitation of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Shigeru Ushio, director-general of Japan’s African Affairs Department and secretary-general of TICAD 7, said the conference will examine ways “to develop Africa through human resources, technology and innovation” focusing on “the economy, community and stability”. Egypt played a central role in preparations for TICAD 7, said Ushio. He noted that engagement in Japanese education projects in Egypt had alerted Japanese officials to the number of African students that come to Egypt to study. A forum, held on the sidelines of the TICAD 7, will introduce business leaders from Africa, Japan and other participating countries to the latest trends in partnerships and will promote a host of novel investment opportunities. The forum includes sessions with prominent political and commercial figures from Japan and Africa focused on innovation and African start-ups, multi-partnering trade, accompanied by an exhibition showcasing small and medium-sized Japanese companies. In addition to leading Japanese companies displaying their products and services to African participants at TICAD 7, each African country is allocated exhibition space to showcase the opportunities it offers investors in environmental and industrial projects. More than 250 events are scheduled on the sidelines of the conference, including seminars, discussions, pavilions and exhibitions. Kotaro Kodama, director of the Middle East and Africa Division at the Overseas Research Department of the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO), notes that Japan is the world’s third strongest economy after the US and China, and 800 Japanese corporations have opened branches in Africa. JETRO, he added, is now engaged in encouraging medium-sized Japanese companies to invest in Africa. Small and medium-sized companies account for 99.7 per cent of Japan’s 80,000 commercial companies. Yet Japanese investments in Africa have so far been limited to conglomerates working on gigantic projects in the fields of energy, infrastructure and vehicle manufacture. Kotaro says that no matter the size of business offered by Japanese companies African local authorities should establish conditions conducive to the functioning of Asian companies. TICAD 7 includes a business expo divided into a section for Japanese companies to offer their projects to African partners, and a second section for African embassies to showcase the investment climate in their countries. Sawaka Takazaki, deputy director of JETRO’s Middle East and Africa Division, said in 2018 Japan exported goods worth $8.152 billion to Africa, up from $7.503 billion in 2017. In the same period Africa exported $8.972 billion in goods to Japan, up from $8.296 billion. Of Japan’s imports by value from Africa in 2018 28 per cent were metals, 19 per cent metal fuels, 10 per cent vehicles, nine per cent slag ores, five per cent seafood, five per cent steel, three per cent wood, two per cent nickel and 19 per cent miscellaneous products. Egypt’s imports from Japan hit $994 million in 2018, up by 19.1 per cent on 2017. Japan’s imports from Egypt reached $271 million in the same period, up by 104.9 per cent. Makoto Marsumura, senior director of JETRO’s Global Strategy Africa Planning Department, told Al-Ahram Weekly that since 2000 investment opportunities have increased in the natural resources, vehicles and infrastructure fields in Africa. More recently, Africa has become a market for Japan to promote food items and kitchen utensils. Marsumura said the Tokyo conference highlighted that Africa was an excellent market for Japan and that there were more investment opportunities in the areas of renewable energy, electronic trade, business and innovation. Diversity was the keyword, he added. The so-called blue economy was high on the TICAD 7 agenda. Countries such as Mauritius and Madagascar have ambitious plans for marine development, an extremely appealing field to Japanese companies, said Marsumura. Takazaki told the Weekly that Japan’s experience in artificial intelligence could help overcome many challenges facing Africa, including global warming. Technology, he said, can help find alternative ways to grow crops across the continent. The widespread belief that Japanese, Chinese and South Korean aid packages to the continent were more or less interchangeable was a misconception, said Kodama. China is most experienced in infrastructure, construction and road building, which it does relatively cheaply; Japan has advantages in the environmental and renewable energy sectors; while South Korea excels at mass producing electronic equipment. TICAD 7, held in the Japanese city of Yokohama from 28 to 30 August, first convened in 1993 in cooperation with the African Union, the Japanese government, the United Nations, the World Bank, and the UN Development Programme. *A version of this article appears in print in the 29 August, 2019 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly newpaper Search Keywords: Short link:

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi has urged African countries to encourage private-public cooperation, saying that the private sector is a major driver of social and economic growth in the continent. "The private sector serves a main driver of providing permanent job opportunities and improving income level, thus contributing to eliminating poverty…and increasing long-term economic growth," El-Sisi told the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) attended by a number of African leaders and representatives of international organisations including the World Bank. El-Sisi called for strengthening cooperation between the Egyptian and Japanese private sectors, and invited Japanese investors to invest in the resource-rich continent. On Wednesday, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to offer enhanced trade insurance to boost private sector investment in Africa,which he said stood at $20 billion over the past three years. El-Sisi, who holds the rotating presidency of the the 55-nation African Union (AU), said African countries are looking to draw investors to infrastructure and energy projects in the region, home to 1.2 billion people. African countries, El-Sisi says, have made progress on improving investment environment in the continent by establishing a 2063 African development agenda, adopting the 2012 the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) and launching the execution phase of a free African trade zone to promote intra-African free trade. Separately, El-Sisi said during talks with Japan's trade minister on the sidelines of the gathering that Cairo is looking to boost cooperation with Japan to promote reliance on gas and clean energy in Egypt's public transportation system. Egypt also looks to draw Japanese investors to a planned economic zone near the Suez Canal which will be international industrial and logistics hub, he added. The three-day event concludes on Friday in Yokohama, south of Tokyo. Search Keywords: Short link:

Foreign minister Sameh Shoukry stressed Egypt's support of Sudan during his first meeting with Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok as his country proceeds towards civilian rule, state-run MENA agency reported. Shoukry stressed the strong relationship between Cairo and Khartoum, MENA said. Shoukry earlier held a meeting with Sudan's first female foreign minister, Asma Mohamed Abdalla, during which he discussed boosting bilateral ties and issues of common interest. He is scheduled to meet the head of the Sudanese sovereign council Abdel-Fattah Al-Borhan. The Egyptian foreign minister travelled to Sudan in a visit “of special importance since it comes at the start of a new phase of cooperation between the two countries to face challenges and coordinate stances on regional and international issues of mutual concern following the changes in Sudan.” Egypt has repeatedly urged stability in the neighbouring country since protests erupted in December 2018, leading to the ouster of long-standing president Omar Al-Bashir in April.

The Regional Information Technology and Software Engineering Centre (RITSEC), and the Finnish Embassy in Cairo launched a new initiative supporting the development of information and knowledge society and technology transfer from the north to the Arab world and Africa. To celebrate the launch of the Regional Knowledge and Innovation Initiative, Finnish Ambassador to Egypt Laura Kansikas-Debraise hosted a reception in her residence this week. The event, reported a Finland Embassy in Cairo statement, was attended by the Finnish delegation headed by Tarja Halonen, the chairman of the board of Trustees of Helsinki University and former president of the Republic of Finland. In addition to several prominent Egyptian education officials present were President of the RITSEC Hisham El-Sherif, former Minister of Family and Population and former Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs Moushira Khattab, Minister of Military Production Mohamed Al-Assar, former Foreign Minister Mohamed El-Orabi along with a galaxy of media representatives. In collaboration with the RITSEC, two meetings were held in Cairo; the Egyptian-Finnish Education Forum and the Egyptian-Finnish University Education Forum. On 7 September, a joint forum was held with the Ministry of Education, led by Tarek Shawki, the Minister of Education and Technical Education. The following day another joint forum with the Ministry of Higher Education, hosted by Khaled Abdel-Ghaffar, Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research, was held in the attendance of a high-level Finnish delegation from Helsinki University and other Finnish education specialists. The inaugural ceremony was attended by Halonen, Kansikas-Debraise, El-Sherif, and a high-level Finnish education delegation including Leena Krokfors from the Faculty of Educational Sciences, the University of Helsinki. An agreement was signed between the Regional IT Institute (RITI), and the University of Helsinki to help in the transfer of Finland's successful practices and models to the Arab world and Africa through a newly established Cairo-based “Finnish Regional Knowledge and Innovation Centre”. The agreement should serve the efforts to build knowledge-based economies, digital societies, creative initiatives and societal innovation in both Africa and the Arab world via Cairo. The Cairo based Finnish Regional Knowledge and Innovation Centre will have several targets such as the transfer of international experience in the field of scientific and educational excellence, supporting and contributing to leading initiatives in education (early childhood, school and special needs), and the encouragement of scientific exchange and missions. For decades, Finland has been one of the leading countries in the field of education. Helsinki University is the leading university in Finland and the world's first in the field of education. Since the early 1990s, the regional centre has been the leader in the introduction of technology, Internet and the initiative of the information society to Egypt, the Arab world and Africa.

News article:
The European University in Egypt (EUE) in Cairo will teach degrees under the "academic direction" of the prestigious London School of Economic (LSE) as part of a deal signed with the University of London. The move is part of Egypt's 2030 vision to develop education, the country's Ambassador to the UK Tareq Adel said on Tuesday. In his speech at an event to mark the signing of the deal, Adel explained that "this step will reflect on the quality of education in Egypt." In August the University of Hertfordshire launched a branch in Egypt, which will be closely followed by Coventry University, as a result of a push by the British government and the advocacy group Universities UK. Partnerships between British education institutions in the UK and Egypt is highly controversial given that the torture and murder of Italian student Giulio Regeni, who was completing research at Cambridge University in the UK, remains unsolved. In 2018 over 200 academics signed a letter opposing this partnership, saying that government officials and university managers seemed to "have forgotten" what happened to Regeni and accused them of "masking human rights abuses in order to make short-term profits in the global education 'market'." READ: Egypt's tuk tuk ban threatens thousands of livelihoods In early 2016 Regeni's body was found dumped by the side of the road in Egypt showing clear signs of torture. Despite international condemnation the Egyptian government has repeatedly delayed investigations into his death. On its part the British government was accused of inaction and putting business interests above human rights. After a 100,000-strong petition demanding government intervention, the British government eventually said it was "appalled" by the murder. The letter signed by the academics questioned "the wisdom and legitimacy of this move to do business as usual with an authoritarian regime that systematically attacks research, education and academic freedom." READ: UK bathroom giant moves to Egypt despite severe repression on workers Academics in Egypt have been asked to get security approval before travelling and must gain approval from the Foreign Ministry to organise international conferences. Five female staff members and 530 female students have been dismissed from universities since the July 2013 coup, according to the international rights group We Record. The pursuit against academics in Egypt is part of a wide-scale campaign against any opposition or perceived opponents to the current regime. It is estimated that there are 60,000 political prisoners in Egypt. Under the current regime an unprecedented number have died from torture, medical neglect, or have been sentenced to death. Note: A previous version of this news piece incorrectly stated that LSE was opening a branch in Cairo, this was amended on 13 September 2019 at 13.15 to clarify that degrees will be taught under the academic direction of LSE.

Egypt and Switzerland inked on Sunday a cooperation agreement to provide technical and financial support for the Egyptian textile and clothing sector through applying the GTEX international programme in Egypt with a total fund of SwF 1.5 million (about $1.5 million). Egypt’s Minister for Trade and Industry Amr Nassar said that this agreement develops ties between the two countries and enhances economic, financial, and technical cooperation. In addition, it helps in implementing Egypt’s strategy to boost the competitiveness of industrial sectors. “GTEX targets raising the competitiveness of Egypt’s SME exports in the textile and garments sector, which is a vital sector for our economy and one of the most important export sectors,” Nassar added. The main objectives of the agreement, which will be in force until 31 December 2021, are to create more job opportunities, improve income levels for workers in the sector, and increase the added value of products and services, as well as increase exports in both new and traditional markets, according to Nassar. Swedish Ambassador in Egypt Paul Garnier said that the GTEX programme is being implemented in Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, and is funded and supported by the Swedish government, while the Egyptian government is providing 10 percent of the total fund.

News article:
Egypt has proposed nine initiatives to help tackle the impact of global warming, reports Mahmoud Bakr During his trip to New York for the 74th UN General Assembly, President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi participated in the 2019 Climate Summit. The summit aims to combat climate change and agree long- and short-term limits on emissions. It offers an opportunity for countries to raise their game when it comes to limiting greenhouse emissions which have reached record levels and continue to rise as countries water down their commitments to combating climate change. Al-Sisi’s address to the summit highlighted the perspectives of Egypt, Africa and developing countries on climate change. The impact of climate change impacts all aspects of our lives, yet Africa’s own global warming gas emissions are minute. There is a dire need for sustainable, appropriate funding and technology and capacity building so developing countries can offset the phenomenon. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the goal of inviting world leaders to the climate summit is to encourage countries to present “concrete action” to the UN in the hope of boosting the Paris Agreement on climate change and the ambitious goals that are the cornerstone of the 2030 Sustainable Development plan. On meeting many aspects of the 2030 sustainable development agenda, he warned, “we are not on the right track.” Guterres said more international cooperation on climate change was needed and called on world leaders to come to the UN with ideas and concrete plans instead of “just talk”. He warned that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century means the world must be carbon-neutral by 2050. “We must reduce emissions drastically in the coming decade, and we want more and more countries to come here and make a commitment to the 2050 carbon neutrality pledge and make reductions,” he said. He asserted that the goal is to reduce emissions by 45 per cent in the coming decades, raise the $100 billion needed each year to help developing countries adapt to, and mitigate, the effects of climate change, and promote investments supporting renewable energy rather than fossil fuels. “We can plant differently and use the land differently and cities can have different strategies to reduce emissions,” he said. “There are many tangible measures that we hope countries, cities and companies will announce at the summit.” Egypt’s Minister of Environment Yasmine Fouad attended meetings of the various climate change alliances, including the Adaptation Alliance headed by Egypt, in partnership with the UK. Fouad reported on Cairo’s efforts to increase international cooperation and noted that Egypt had presented nine initiatives on climate change. She said the alliance was working on uniting global efforts to address the impact of climate change and support Third World countries which suffer most from the effects of global warming. Fouad added that Egypt is honouring its commitments under the Paris Agreement and supports raising adaptation goals. “We made a political announcement at the summit focused on funding adaptation, supporting early warning systems, responding to natural disasters, including adaptation in national plans, and calling on advanced countries to increase funding for adaptation,” she said. Fouad reiterated Egypt’s full support and commitment to climate action through the alliance it co-chairs with the UK. “We have several ambitious initiatives needed to meet adaptation needs and flexibility and a precise plan of implementation that relies on increasing funding and support for developing countries that suffer the most from the impact of climate change.” Egypt, she said, will always support global group action, which is why, in 2015 at the Paris conference, President Al-Sisi launched the African Adaptation Initiative to encourage advanced countries to honour their commitments to help African states confront the adverse effects of climate change. The initiative also fine-tunes African demands and concerns, including early warning systems, funding, national plans and investment packages for the private sector. Fouad said Egypt has submitted initiatives that protect the most vulnerable through Risk-Informed Early Action Partnership (REAP) and which will provide security for more than a billion people facing climate change, as well as initiatives on small-scale agriculture. Egypt succeeded in changing the global climate change agenda by including adaptation as a priority at the Climate Summit, and convinced 107 countries to sign the political declaration presented by Egypt that sets adaptation as a top priority in environmental action. By chairing the Convention on Biological Diversity and the International Alliance on Adaptation and Mitigation, Egypt has shown it can lead the world on global environmental issues that serve the interests of all countries, said Fouad. The minister of environment was also a key speaker at the World Climate Resilience Day, held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, where she addressed more than 400 young people on building a future capable of confronting climate change. The beginning, she said, is in the hands of the young, and must include education that combines action against climate change, protection of biodiversity and the curbing of desertification. “Youth must be given a chance to lessen the impact of climate change and adapt to it through their innovative solutions and new projects.” Fouad also called on states to move faster in confronting the impact of climate change. Africa, she said, remains vulnerable to climate change: 1,000 natural disasters that have impacted on the lives of more than 200 million people across the continent and caused the death of 400,000. *A version of this article appears in print in the 26 September, 2019 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly under the title: Confronting climate change Search Keywords: Short link:

At the ceremony organised by the Egyptian Foreign Ministry on the occasion of the end of term of Belarusian Ambassador to Cairo Sergei Rachkov, the ambassador said that his love for Egypt was behind the great mutual and unprecedented achievements in the history of relations between the two countries. Present at the Egyptian Foreign Ministry celebration were Ambassador Amr Ramadan, assistant foreign minister for European affairs, Ambassador Ismail Khayrat, assistant foreign minister for financial, administrative and General Bureau affairs, Ambassador Hatem Tag El-Din, assistant foreign minister for protocol, and Ambassador Nahla Al-Zawahry, deputy assistant foreign minister for Europe, Eastern and Southern countries. Rachkov stressed that the state of love and understanding that has prevailed during his tenure in Egypt since 2013 contributed directly to the accomplishment of these achievements, some of which were unprecedented, where the president of Belarus visited Egypt for the first time and his Egyptian counterpart paid a visit to Belarus and signed 25 agreements and a Memorandum of Understanding and Joint Action Programmes (roadmap). “The volume of trade exchange increased by 75 percent, and so did the visits of the ministers of trade, industry, agriculture, telecommunications and information, natural resources, environment protection and military production. For the first time, the Speaker of the Egyptian House of Representatives visited, and joint projects were implemented in the fields of the industry, agriculture, education and security,” he pointed out. That is in addition to signing joint cooperation contracts for the manufacturing of trucks, diesel engines, tractors, loaders, heavy equipment, and agricultural equipment and the establishment of cooperation councils in the field of military, technical and security cooperation, Rachkov added. “And in the field of education, for the first time, both countries agreed on the establishment of a joint engineering faculty between the Belarusian National University of Technology and Al-Tebin Institute for Metallurgical Studies in Helwan. The rate of tourism to Egypt increased as well.” For his part, Fathi Toughan, who was behind the idea of the joint engineering faculty project, presented a memorial gift from Al-Tebin Institute to Ambassador Rachkov. President of the Arab Union of Soviet and Russian University Graduates Sherif Gad also granted the society’s shield to the ambassador, stressing that his regular presence in the Egyptian cultural activities confirmed his passion for Egypt and the Egyptian arts. Rachkov was honoured by the President of Belarus in 2019 and received the Order of Honour from the Council of Ministers of Belarus, and the Browns International Foundation of America has included his biography on its page among the famous bankers and international financial executives.

Previously, we went over Maryam Rajavi’s description of the Iranian people’s struggle from freedom from the beginning of the 20th Century until the 1979 revolution. Today, we will look at the true goal of the anti-monarchic revolution that was cruelly snatched from the people by the mullahs. In 1979, days after the Shah fled the country, Massoud Rajavi, the only leader of the Iranian Resistance still alive, thanks to an international campaign by his Geneva-based brother, was released from prison. Massoud, who would later become Maryam Rajavi’s husband, set about rebuilding the Iranian Resistance group the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI or MEK), which had been gutted by opportunists while the leaders were locked in the Shah’s dungeons. Despite that huge task, Maryam Rajavi notes that Massoud was unwilling to let Regime Founder Ruhollah Khomeini, who had stolen the people’s revolution to establish his theocratic dictatorship, get away with his “bloodthirsty” actions in the name of Islam. Maryam Rajavi recounts that in a meeting in Tehran with Massoud, shortly after his release, Khomeini offered Massoud anything he wanted in order to encourage the people of Iran, who’d just been denied the freedom they fought for, to support the Regime. Maryam Rajavi quoted Khomeini as saying to Massoud, “You are young and young people listen to you. Write down a few sentences and say that those who are not religious are not entitled to engage in political activities. And then all paths will be available to you”. But Massoud refused. Maryam Rajavi quoted him as replying that he could not do so “because the Iranian people’s revolution pursued freedom, and in our view, Islam is a religion of freedom”. Indeed, Massoud and his supporters began their struggle anew against the second dictator they’d faced, with Masoud soon establishing the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) in Tehran in 1981. Then, Khomeini realised that the Iranian Resistance would not sacrifice their goals and convictions in order to win political ranks or positions. Maryam Rajavi said: “[Massoud] did not let Khomeini establish eternal rule for his Satanic Caliphate under the banner of Islam. Employing the rallying cries of peace and freedom, he did not let Khomeini continue his unjust eight-year war with Iraq.” Despite Iraq asking for peace talks in 1982, after two years of war, Khomeini dragged the conflict on until 1988, when he was eventually forced by Massoud and his National Liberation Army of Iran to agree to peace. Khomeini planned to “[conquer] Quds (Jerusalem) via Karbala” and Iraq, apparently at any cost. The war left 1 million Iranians dead, 1 million more wounded, 4 million displaced from the warzone, $1 trillion worth of damages and 50 cities burnt to the ground. In our next piece, we will learn about the Resistance’s 40-year struggle against the Regime.

Previously, we went over Maryam Rajavi’s description of the Iranian people’s struggle from freedom from the beginning of the 20th Century until the 1979 revolution. Today, we will look at the true goal of the anti-monarchic revolution that was cruelly snatched from the people by the mullahs. In 1979, days after the Shah fled the country, Massoud Rajavi, the only leader of the Iranian Resistance still alive, thanks to an international campaign by his Geneva-based brother, was released from prison. Massoud, who would later become Maryam Rajavi’s husband, set about rebuilding the Iranian Resistance group the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI or MEK), which had been gutted by opportunists while the leaders were locked in the Shah’s dungeons.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print Municipality of Paris’ 1st District hangs a large banner in protest to Zarif’s visit Iranians residing in France, supporters of the Iranian Resistance, and human rights organizations took part in a rally against the visit to Paris by Javad Zarif, the mullahs’ foreign minister. Hundreds of Iranians took part in the protest, which started in the early hours of Friday August 23 at Place du Trocadero in Paris. Demonstrators carried a large banner that read “Expel Zarif.” They chanted: “Zarif is a terrorist, expel him.” One of the placards carried by the demonstrators had the writing: “End making concessions to the mullahs.” Another placard read: “Shut down the Iranian regime’s espionage centers in Europe.” The Paris District 1 municipality installed a large banner on the city hall opposing Zarif’s visit. The banner read: “Iran’s Mullahs and its Foreign Minister violate our principles. We do not welcome them.” Banner against Javad Zarif’s presence in France – Municipality of Paris’ 1st District, August 23, 2019 France is Zarif’s last stop on a European tour that began last weekend. His visits to Finland, Sweden, and Norway have been met with loud protests by Iranians residing in each of these countries. The protests highlighted widespread human rights abuses in Iran and the role of the mullahs’ regime in terrorism and crisis-making in the region. In response to objections to the trip, the Swedish Foreign Minister stated that her government had not invited Zarif and he had come to Sweden at his own request. Continuing protests have so enraged Zarif that in an interview with the state-run Press TV on August 21, he railed at Iranian protesters demanding his expulsion from Sweden. “Ask anyone of those individuals standing outside to attend any meetings by Iranians (meaning the regime’s Revolutionary Guards and agents) and then see whether they would survive. They would not stay alive for a minute…. They cannot stay in Iraq either because the people of Iraq (meaning the regime’s proxies in that country) will eat them alive.” Supporters of the Iranian Resistance pointed out that the mullahs’ regime faces an explosive domestic situation, with continuing protests and demonstrations nationwide and increasing international isolation, and that it is struggling to survive. Activists have expressed the belief that the regime is in its final phase, and have argued that foreign invitations to the Foreign Minister would embolden that regime to intensify the repression and killing in Iran, as well as terrorism and crisis in the region. The protesters emphasized that Zarif represents a regime that maintains the world’s highest per-capita rate of executions, is the most active state sponsor of terrorism, is the primary source of crisis and chaos in the region, and is the main patron of Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad in his massacre of the people of Syria. Zarif and his ministry’s mission is to defend and whitewash the mullahs’ crimes, and to coordinate and facilitate terrorist plots abroad. In 2018 alone, five of the regime’s diplomat-terrorists, including an ambassador, were expelled from Europe for their direct role in terrorist conspiracies against the Iranian Resistance and dissidents. Another four operatives, including an accredited diplomat, are in prison and awaiting trial in Belgium for plotting to bomb the Free Iran gathering in Paris in 2018, attended by hundreds of French and international dignitaries.

The protesters spoke out against the regime’s human rights violations, including murdering dissidents and suppressing women, rights activists and religious minorities. They criticised the Swedish government for allowing Javad Zarif to enter Sweden and demanded his immediate expulsion. They sought to amplify the voices of protesters in Iran who are largely ignored by the world’s media. The protesters chanted: “Zarif, get lost!” “Zarif is a murderer and enemy of all Iranians” “Zarif is a murderer, talks with him are unacceptable” “Zarif is a charlatan and enemy of the people of Iran” “Zarif is a terrorist murderer” However, the protesters were subjected to violence by the Swedish Police, with 50 protesters beaten up and arrested, including women’s rights activists, former political prisoners, and families of victims of the 1988 massacre. Frankly, this is all too similar to the suppression of protesters in Iran. Juxtaposed with Sweden welcoming the murderous Zarif as a guest, this is all the more appalling. In an interview with the state-run Iranian Press TV on Wednesday, Zarif threatened the protesters with murders, saying that if they were caught by the regime’s agents “they would not stay alive for a minute.” These protests still scared Zarif enough to pull out of a joint press conference with Swedish Foreign Minister, Margot Wallström. Wallström was then left to justify her meeting with Zarif, who was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department last month for being “just as complicit in the regime’s outlaw behaviour as the rest of [Supreme Leader Ali] Khamenei’s mafia”. She condemned the regime for its record of human rights abuses and insisted that the regime must comply with all its nuclear deal obligations and release the British-flagged oil tanker, Stena Impero. But don’t Zarif’s threats indicate how the regime treats its prisoners, without any indication of a behaviour change to come? He emboldens the regime to take part in terrorism, murder and warmongering, in complete antithesis to the wishes of the Iranian people. Speaking at the Free Iran conference in July, Kenneth Lewis, a Swedish jurist and former member of parliament, said: “Our Foreign Minister last year visited Tehran. A foreign minister, a woman who represents a feminist foreign policy, goes to Iran to sell trucks and construction equipment and even puts on a chador… A country like Sweden who claims that they are defending human rights is more interested in selling their trucks and don’t care really about human rights when it comes down to the final analysis.”

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print Does believing in diplomacy and not being a proponent of war oblige one to deal with tyrants or embrace their facilitators and enablers? Of course, any conscientious person would say no. So why do Norwegian officials feel obliged to roll out the red carpet for Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, during his Scandinavian tour, asks former Norwegian lawmaker Lars Rise. In an opinion piece for International Policy Digest on Thursday, August 22, 2019, Mr. Rise wrote: “The Iranian regime has the world’s highest rate of executions per capita and is the leading state sponsor of terrorism. Among other destructive regional activities, Iran has been the main supporter of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and it is increasingly threatening the wider world with its ballistic missile program.” “The Iranian theocracy is based on the concept of Velayat-e faqih, or absolute rule of the supreme leader. Every official is vetted for allegiance to him, and Ali Khamenei himself hand picks a number of ministers, including the foreign minister. So it is unsurprising that Zarif has been complicit for years in the Iranian regime’s malign activities. He has not only been the face and voice of the ayatollahs’ rule, he has personally worked to implement Khamenei’s reckless agenda and to justify and whitewash Tehran’s crimes at home and abroad. In reality, he is more of a propaganda minister than a foreign minister,” argued Mr. Rise. “With a wide smile and fluent English, Zarif is dubbed by some in the West as the moderate face of his regime. But that role was deliberately bestowed upon him by the regime’s leaders in order to solidify their impunity. In reality, Zarif is anything but moderate.” “Since he became foreign minister in 2013, the regime has executed more than 3,500 people, including women and children. According to Iranian opposition, more than 8,000 activists were arrested during early-2018 protests in more than 160 cities throughout the country and a number of them were tortured to death.” “Zarif is no stranger to crimes against humanity. He was active as a senior career diplomat in the United Nations in 1988 while his government butchered over 30,000 political prisoners, members and supporters of the Mojahedin-e Khalq, the main opposition movement in Iran.” “A diplomat from the Iranian embassy in Vienna has been charged with a plot to bomb a MEK rally in Paris on June 2018 and is awaiting trial in Belgium. The ambassador and first secretary from the Iranian embassy in Albania were expelled from that country last December on similar charges. Zarif is ultimately their boss,” Mr. Rise pointed out. He added that Zarif publicly boasts of being a cohort of notorious figures such as Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the notorious IRGC Quds Force, who has been directly implicated in much of the chaos in Iraq, Yemen, and Syria. At a meeting in February 2019 between Zarif and Hassan Nasrallah, the head of the Lebanese Hezbollah, Nasrollah thanked Zarif for his regime’s help in fighting what he called “Zionist aggression.” According to Al-Manar TV, a Hezbollah-affiliated broadcaster, Zarif pledged continued Iranian support for Hezbollah, despite the fact that Iranian government assessments anticipate 70 percent of the Iranian people are sliding under the poverty line by the end of 2019. Mr. Rise further wrote: “Zarif’s participation in his regime’s two-faced game has worked fine for the ayatollahs over the years due to an appeasement policy that was pursued on both sides of the Atlantic for three decades. But that policy is coming to an end, and the Iranian regime can no longer count on the U.S. to be its life saver.” “One would hope that the same would be true of U.S. allies like Norway. But receiving a state visit from someone like Javad Zarif is unethical. It is not politically savvy either. Tehran faces growing signs of dissent, particularly among the youth, its economy is falling apart and its international isolation is growing. Anyone who embraces Zarif gives legitimacy to a government that is on the verge of collapse.” “Nobody wants a war with Iran, but the best way to prevent war is to reject Tehran’s egregious conduct wholesale. By rejecting Zarif’s visit and holding him to account, Norway would be taking an ethical and principled position while sending a message of support to the Iranian people who are crying out for freedom,” Mr. Rise summed up. Lars Rise is a former member of the Norwegian Parliament from the Christian Democratic Party.

Among other destructive regional activities, Iran has been the main supporter of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and it is increasingly threatening the wider world with its ballistic missile program.” “The Iranian theocracy is based on the concept of Velayat-e faqih, or absolute rule of the supreme leader. Every official is vetted for allegiance to him, and Ali Khamenei himself hand picks a number of ministers, including the foreign minister. So it is unsurprising that Zarif has been complicit for years in the Iranian regime’s malign activities. He has not only been the face and voice of the ayatollahs’ rule, he has personally worked to implement Khamenei’s reckless agenda and to justify and whitewash Tehran’s crimes at home and abroad. In reality, he is more of a propaganda minister than a foreign minister,” argued Mr. Rise. “With a wide smile and fluent English, Zarif is dubbed by some in the West as the moderate face of his regime. But that role was deliberately bestowed upon him by the regime’s leaders in order to solidify their impunity. In reality, Zarif is anything but moderate.” “Since he became foreign minister in 2013, the regime has executed more than 3,500 people, including women and children. According to Iranian opposition, more than 8,000 activists were arrested during early-2018 protests in more than 160 cities throughout the country and a number of them were tortured to death.” “Zarif is no stranger to crimes against humanity. He was active as a senior career diplomat in the United Nations in 1988 while his government butchered over 30,000 political prisoners, members and supporters of the Mojahedin-e Khalq, the main opposition movement in Iran.” “A diplomat from the Iranian embassy in Vienna has been charged with a plot to bomb a MEK rally in Paris on June 2018 and is awaiting trial in Belgium. The ambassador and first secretary from the Iranian embassy in Albania were expelled from that country last December on similar charges. Zarif is ultimately their boss,” Mr. Rise pointed out. He added that Zarif publicly boasts of being a cohort of notorious figures such as Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the notorious IRGC Quds Force, who has been directly implicated in much of the chaos in Iraq, Yemen, and Syria. At a meeting in February 2019 between Zarif and Hassan Nasrallah, the head of the Lebanese Hezbollah, Nasrollah thanked Zarif for his regime’s help in fighting what he called “Zionist aggression.” According to Al-Manar TV, a Hezbollah-affiliated broadcaster, Zarif pledged continued Iranian support for Hezbollah, despite the fact that Iranian government assessments anticipate 70 percent of the Iranian people are sliding under the poverty line by the end of 2019. Mr. Rise further wrote: “Zarif’s participation in his regime’s two-faced game has worked fine for the ayatollahs over the years due to an appeasement policy that was pursued on both sides of the Atlantic for three decades. But that policy is coming to an end, and the Iranian regime can no longer count on the U.S. to be its life saver.” “One would hope that the same would be true of U.S. allies like Norway. But receiving a state visit from someone like Javad Zarif is unethical. It is not politically savvy either. Tehran faces growing signs of dissent, particularly among the youth, its economy is falling apart and its international isolation is growing. Anyone who embraces Zarif gives legitimacy to a government that is on the verge of collapse.” “Nobody wants a war with Iran, but the best way to prevent war is to reject Tehran’s egregious conduct wholesale. By rejecting Zarif’s visit and holding him to account, Norway would be taking an ethical and principled position while sending a message of support to the Iranian people who are crying out for freedom,” Mr. Rise summed up. Lars Rise is a former member of the Norwegian Parliament from the Christian Democratic Party.

Previously, we looked at the history of the Resistance and where it is headed, but here we will look at how the Regime is disrupting the Middle East in order to attack or distract the world. Maryam Rajavi said: “The regime is fuelling tensions in a bid to push back against the international community. They foment turmoil and chaos to hide their fear of being overthrown. They want firmness to be replaced with the policy of appeasement. And they want to allay fears and anxiety of their Bassij forces and Revolutionary Guards and to preserve their internal balance and equilibrium.” The Regime is incredibly unstable and could not handle sustained “confrontation” from the West or any of its countries, so they seek to distract by, among other things, announcing the will to create “a young, Hezbollahi government”, as Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei did on May 22. Maryam Rajavi said: “The reality is that schism and instability are among the signs that the regime is in its final chapter. The clerical regime is not going to find a way out of its inevitable downfall.” Now, Regime apologists have a long history of appeasing the mullahs and ignoring its crimes at home and abroad, essentially protecting what Maryam Rajavi terms “the greatest sponsor and godfather of international terrorism”. Maryam Rajavi said: “Instead of the regime, they targeted its arch-nemesis, namely the Iranian Resistance, levelling fictitious accusations against it. They blacklisted the Mojahedin instead of Khamenei’s network, and the National Liberation Army of Iran instead the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Of course, we proudly prevailed in more than 20 courts. They did not find even a single piece of incriminating evidence against the [Resistance]. This history is reminiscent of the ancient Iranian myth where the hero Siavash safely passes through flames of accusations against him.” But now the tides are changing and the “obscuring curtains” are being peeled back and everyone can see that the Regime is the source of war and warmongering, who are certainly not protecting Iran from a future of war, turmoil and secessions following the overthrow of the Regime. Maryam Rajavi said: “As the Iranian Resistance said from the outset, fighting against this regime is equivalent to seeking peace because it eliminates the source of war and turmoil… Now, everyone can see that so long as this regime remains in place, war and crises will continue and intensify in the region. Therefore, anyone who seeks freedom for Iran, anyone who wants to save Iran from destruction and chaos, anyone who wants global and regional peace and stability, must rise up to demand the overthrow of the mullahs’ regime.” In our next piece, we will look at the lies of the appeasement policy and the Resistance’s historical mission.

News article:
The wave of murders, committed on the fatwa of Iranian Regime founder Ruhollah Khomeini, began in the notorious prisons of Evin and Gohardasht, in Tehran and Karaj, respectively. It spread quickly across the country. Many victims, members of the opposition MEK, had already served their prison terms and were just awaiting their release date, many were elderly or teenagers, many had not even been convicted for their peaceful political activities. It didn’t matter to the “death commissions”, who sent the victims to be killed after five-minute kangaroo trials. Iran HRM wrote: “The victims were hanged by forklift trucks and cranes or from beams in half-constructed buildings, in groups of five or six at half-hourly intervals all day long. Others were killed by firing squads. The number of those executed were too many to be buried individually. They were collectively ditched in purpose dug trenches constituting mass graves.” There are over 120 mass graves across Iran filled with the remains of the 1988 massacre’s victims, but many families were never told about the killings, never provided with death certificates, and never given the location of the graves. They were ordered never to mourn them in public. Those who tried to find the graves have been arrested and tortured, with the Regime trying to erase all evidence of the massacres by building over the mass graves. In fact, Iran has arrested (and in some cases tortures and executed) the following people fore merely drawing attention to the 1988 massacre: MEK supporter Ali Saremi, who gave a speech at Khavaran Cemetery outside Tehran, the site of one of the unmarked mass graves Mansoureh Behkish, who lost six siblings during the 1988 massacre, who posted online about Iran’s human rights violations Human rights defender Raheleh Rahemipour, who filed a complaint with the UN about the enforced disappearances of her brother and his infant daughter, Golrou Maryam Akbari-Monfared, who asked the UN to help her find the truth about the fate of her forcibly disappeared siblings who were members of the MEK Importantly, no one has been punished for their role in the massacre and many of them still hold high-ranking positions in Iran today. That is why the international community should hold the Regime to account as failure to act is emboldening the Regime’s human rights violations. Iran HRM wrote: “We urge the international community, the UN Security Council, the UN Human Rights Council and its member states, as well as other relevant United Nation agencies, the European Union, all advocates of human rights and justice to end the immunity of those responsible for the 1988 massacre.” They advocate for referring Iran’s dossier of human rights violations to the UN Security Council and for the UN to launch an international independent fact-finding mission to determine the fates of the 1988 massacre victims.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print An event commemorating Iran’s 1988 massacre of political prisoners was held on Friday in Paris District 1’s City Hall. The conference, titled, “Iran: Massacred Human Rights: 31st anniversary of massacre of 30,000 political prisoners in 1988,” brought together French lawmakers, mayors and human rights activists who appealed to the French government and the United Nations to hold Iranian officials accountable for their “ongoing crime against humanity.” Iranian opposition leader hommage au côté de Jean-François Legaret – pic.twitter.com/cOwIsOr0CF — MichèledeVaucouleurs (@MdeVaucouleurs) August 30, 2019 Jean-François Legaret, Mayor of Paris’ District 1, told the conference: “Beyond our solidarity, we must remember the international principles against mass killings, especially that of the 1988 massacre in Iran. There must be no impunity for the mullahs in Iran.” Other speakers at the event included French mayors Guy Schmidt and Jean-Claude Jegoudez, former French lawmakers Jean-Pierre Brard and François Colcombet, NCRI Women’s Committee Chair Sarvnaz Chitsaz, and NCRI Representative in France Dr. Saleh Radjavi. Survivors of the 1988 massacre and victims’ relatives gave first-hand accounts of the atrocities committed by the mullahs’ regime. Background on Iran’s 1988 Massacre: • More than 30,000 political prisoners were massacred in Iran in the summer of 1988. • The massacre was carried out on the basis of a fatwa by Khomeini. • The vast majority of the victims were activists of the opposition People’s Mojahedin (PMOI, Mujahedin-e Khalq or MEK). • Death Commissions approved all the death sentences. • Alireza Avaei, a member of the Death Commissions, is today Hassan Rouhani’s Justice Minister. • The perpetrators of the 1988 massacre have never been brought to justice. • On August 9, 2016, an audio tape was published for the first time of Khomeini’s former heir acknowledging that that massacre took place and had been ordered at the highest levels. • It’s time for the UN to investigate Iran’s 1988 massacre.

Previously, we looked at the history of the Resistance, where it is headed, why the Regime is disrupting the Middle East, the lies of the appeasement policy, and why the only solution to the Regime is its overthrow by the people of Iran. Here we will look at how the units of rebellion are making that a reality. Maryam Rajavi explained that the spread of the MEK’s rebellion units was a major breakthrough during the ongoing anti-regime uprising that began in December 2017 and is the answer to a regime that is incapable of reform. This is how the people will overthrow the Regime. The Regime knows this, which is why they are cracking down on the MEK units and arresting members. In fact, Iranian Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi said that 116 MEK units were arrested this year, while the director-general of intelligence in East Azerbaijan Province said the regime had arrested 110 people, issuing death sentences and lengthy prison terms. Maryam Rajavi said: “The enemy can neither succeed in breaking the morale of resistance forces in prisons nor is it able to thwart the resistance movement and the units of rebellion in cities… Every young man or woman yearning for freedom and justice is a potential or de facto rebel… Victory is ours and the dawn is looming.” Maryam Rajavi explained that there are two sides facing off against each other over the future of Iran; on one side the deadlocked regime, on the other “a nation and its Resistance fighting for freedom”. She said that alternative to the mullahs is freedom and that the Resistance will establish a “democratic and pluralist republic” based on the separation of religion and state, gender equality, the autonomy of Iran’s ethnic groups, and a non-nuclear Iran. She explained that the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), the coalition of democratic resistance groups has a plan to bring power to the people and ensure a peaceful transition of power to the Iranian people’s elected representatives after the mullahs fall from power. The NCRI would take over with Maryam Rajavi as President, for a period not to exceed six months to plan the elections and then when the representatives were ready, the NCRI would withdraw. Maryam Rajavi said: “The day is not far when Iran, the Land of Lion and Sun, will embrace freedom. We are determined to create a new future, a new plan devoid of tyranny, reactionary thought, duplicity and discrimination. A new design for a free and prosperous Iran. So, we will sing in unison as we march toward victory: we will take back Iran and we will build a new homeland. Yes, indeed, we will take back Iran.”

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print Berlin: The Iranian community based in Germany, supporters of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI, Mujahedin-e Khalq or MEK), on Friday, September 7, 2019, held a protest to denounce the presence of the Mayor of Tehran Pirouz Hanachi in Berlin. The protest was held outside the entrance of the Red Town Hall (the building of the Berlin state government), where the mullah-appointed Tehran Mayor was supposed to be welcomed. Given the strength of the protest, authorities were forced to take Hanachi through the municipality’s back entrance and garage. The head of the office of the Berlin state government Prime Minister said there would be no red carpet for Hanachi and he would not be signing the Golden Book of Berlin. Last week, protests against this visit gained widespread political dimensions in Germany. Nearly all the factions in the Berlin state parliament protested to Mayor Michael Müller. The head of the Christian Democratic Union group in the Berlin parliament, Burkard Dregger, described the invitation as intolerable and called for its cancellation. Kai Wegner, head of the CDU Party in Berlin said Muller must not appear in any photo-op with Hanachi and must cancel the meeting altogether. The United States Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell said the Revolutionary Guards-affiliated Mayor of Tehran belongs on the US and European sanctions lists, not on the VIP stand in Berlin. The protesters denounced the presence of the representative of the terrorist mullahs’ regime in Berlin as a “political disgrace” and called for an end to the policy of appeasing the regime. They reiterated that welcoming the mullah-appointed Mayor in Berlin is a regretful sign of the European Union and Germany’s failed Iran policy. This policy is banking on the corrupt mullahs instead of the millions of Iranian citizens who strive for an end to the religious dictatorship in Iran.

While the Iranian public has been taking part in a nationwide uprising since the start of 2018, the Iranian Diaspora have been supporting them, this year holding several rallies in the US and Europe. There they asserted that Maryam Rajavi and her Ten Point Plan for a future democratic Iran is the only way to prevent the Iranian Regime from further destroying the Middle East and harming the Iranian people. These protests in the West surrounded the Free Iran Rally, normally attended by over 100,000 Iranian opposition members and supporters, which is held each summer to call for an end to the violent and barbaric Regime and the rise of Maryam Rajavi’s Resistance. The Free Iran rally, where Maryam Rajavi is always the keynote speaker, is sponsored by dozens of associations and rights groups that support a free, democratic, non-nuclear Iran. The Western-based protests were held in Brussels (June 15), Washington DC (June 21), Berlin (July 6), and London (July 27), with dozens of speakers advocating for Maryam Rajavi to take control of Iran, as domestic protests escalate against the regime’s repression, economic mismanagement and terrorist activities, and other malign behaviour. At the same time as the uprising in Iran, international policy has shifted dramatically in terms of the Regime with many countries recognising that the mullahs should not be supported any longer because it is clear there are no moderates in the Regime. Some politicians are even beginning to recognise that they should support Maryam Rajavi’s opposition instead, recognising that continued support of the regime in Iran is just emboldening the mullahs and its terrorist groups. In response, the regime has been cracking down on political opponents, especially those who support Maryam Rajavi, and appointing noted criminals to high-ranking positions in the Regime. This shows that the regime is incapable of fixing the crises plaguing Iran, while Maryam Rajavi is capable of saving Iran. Despite the crackdown, the Iranian people still take to the streets to voice their support for Maryam Rajavi at every opportunity, while also shouting slogans like “leave Syria and Lebanon. Think of us”, which is a reference to the millions of dollars spent on funding extremism in the region. The Iranian diaspora are showing solidarity with the uprisings in Iran and asking that international community to recognise Maryam Rajavi’s movement as the viable democratic alternative to the mullahs, which would include blacklisting the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) and the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS) for their role in repression and terrorism. The Iranian diaspora and supporters of the Iranian opposition are using #IStandWithMaryamRajavi on social media to raise awareness for their cause and voice support for the Iranian people, the NCRI and Maryam Rajavi in their struggle for a Free Iran.

In our previous pieces, we focused on Maryam Rajavi’s speech about the key discriminations against women, Iranian women’s widespread participation in the struggle against the two dictatorships, and how the Iranian Resistance has been dedicated to gender equality since the start. Here, we will talk about how the Iranian resistance, particularly the MEK, and the women within it are encouraging more women (and men) to join the resistance to support equality. Maryam Rajavi stated that the equality and emancipation of women will only happen on Iran is free from the Regime that suppresses all Iranians, but especially women. Then, she spoke about how the Iranian resistance had profoundly rejected misogyny, which is why women consistently hold high positions in the movement. Maryam Rajavi said that the women of the resistance have defied the negative stereotypes about women and shown themselves to be “efficient and capable in shouldering more responsibilities and paving the way for their advancement”. Maryam Rajavi advised that women “can and must” lead the way in overthrowing the regime and bringing peace to the Middle East. Maryam Rajavi said: “The emancipating message of the [the Resistance], and specifically the message of gender equality, has been embraced by young women and men in cities across Iran. The resistance units have expanded over the past two years. Women in the Iranian resistance have acted as the role model for them.” She further explained that the young women have been inspired by Resistance’s “four decades of sacrifice and perseverance”, who are directed by “the cause of freedom and equality”. Maryam Rajavi said: “At this point, I would like to salute Iran’s political prisoners especially my sisters who have been resisting and defying the regime in [Supreme Leader Ali] Khamenei’s jails in various cities. In addition to opposition to dictatorship, they have committed the unforgivable crime of being a rebellious woman. To be a woman and not surrender, to be a woman and persevere in the struggle, to be a woman and instead of thinking about yourself, think about the liberation of a people in chains, this is something that has driven the mullahs insane.” She then addressed her sisters in Iran, who are fed up with the Iranian Regime and recognize that the regime is at an impasse. Maryam Rajavi said: “The clerical regime is working day and night, to force Iranian women into submission. But Iran’s enlightened women and rebellious girls inspired by the 1,000 women of Ashraf, are following the tradition of an emancipating struggle. This is a role model devoid of all gender-based discriminations in outlook, standards, mentalities, and values. This is a role model where women are arisen, decisive, and capable of having an impact and opening the way.” Maryam Rajavi finished by saying that Iranian women believe that their fate is intrinsically linked to the fate of their country, so they believe it’s their duty to save Iran from dictatorship and poverty.

News article:
WASHINGTON: Protesters have vowed to confront Iranian President Hassan Rouhani over the country’s “medieval regime” when he addresses the UN on Wednesday. People started gathering last week near the UN’s headquarters in New York and their numbers will continue to grow, according to the political director for the Organization of Iranian American Communities (OIAC), which coordinates anti-Tehran activism in the US. The OIAC’s Dr. Majid Sadeghpour said the international community should not be “fooled” by Iran's representatives. “No amount of economic and political concessions can moderate the behavior of this medieval regime,” he said. “The mullahs understand only the language of power and firmness. Maximum pressure must be applied to help the Iranian people free themselves from the yoke of the mullahs. We began protesting last week in anticipation of the opening of the UN General Assembly’s 74th Session and the appearance of Iran's officials, and we will continue protesting until the Iranian regime is held responsible for its ongoing atrocities against the people of Iran.” Protestors were holding daily vigils to remind the world about Iran's history of terror and brutality against its people, he added, and Trump and the UN must “reject the false pretenses of moderation” from Rouhani and his representatives. Sadeghpour said Rouhani and other Iranian officials should be held accountable for the killing of more than 120,000 Iranian civilians, including the 30,000 murdered during a gruesome nationwide purge in 1988. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who has previously addressed protests against the Iranian government, is expected to join former Sen. Joseph Lieberman in speaking to protesters at next week’s rallies. Trump had previously accused Iran of terrorism and violence, but appeared to soften his stance when he said he would meet Rouhani if he came to the opening session of the UN’s 74th General Assembly. But a week ago, after a coordinated drone and cruise missile attack targeted Saudi Aramco oil fields in the Kingdom’s Eastern Province, Trump said the US military was “locked and loaded,” suggesting the US was ready to go to war with Iran. Trump said he would move to block Rouhani and his team from attending the UN meeting, but he later relented. On Friday he revealed details of additional sanctions against Iran, which he described as the toughest ever imposed. The Treasury Department decided to take action against Iran’s central bank after US officials concluded Tehran was responsible for the drone and missile attacks on Saudi oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais.

News article:
A police K-9 unit works at a security checkpoint outside the UN headquarters on the first day of the general debate at the UN General Assembly, Tuesday, September 24, 2019, in New York. (AP) Asharq Al-Awsat President Donald Trump's personal lawyer and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani told a crowd of several hundred protesters outside the United Nations on Tuesday that he supports regime change in Iran. "I am speaking in my individual capacity. I am for regime change. Down with the tyrants in Iran. Down with the ayatollah and the mullahs and all the crooks," he told the crowd, referring to Iran's clerical leadership. The rally on Tuesday, organized by opposition groups in exile and The International Convention for the Future of Iran, took place a day before Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is set to deliver his remarks before the UN General Assembly. It's one of several high-profile anti-Iranian government events taking place on the sidelines of the UN gathering this week. At the General Assembly, US President Donald Trump said all nations have a duty to act against Iran and "no responsible government should subsidize Iran's bloodlust." He said Washington has imposed the highest level of sanctions on Iran and says as long as Iran's "menacing behavior continues" sanctions will not be lifted and instead will be tightened. He added that Iran's leaders have lashed out at others for 40 years for the problems that they alone have created.

The demonstrators criticized the mullahs and all appeasement of them, saying that the Regime doesn’t represent the Iranian people and opposition coalition the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) and its President-elect Maryam Rajavi should hold that Iran’s seat in the UN. They said that the UN and other countries should use maximum diplomatic and economic pressure to isolate the regime. The Iranian people have already made clear, through continuous protests, that they want the regime to be overthrown in its entirety; a call that is only expanding because the mullahs are incapable of reform. The former mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani spoke at the rally, saying that the regime will be overthrown and the NCRI will take over and bring freedom to Iran, restoring women’s rights and ending capital punishment. Senator Joseph Lieberman, a former US vice-presidential nominee, told the rally: “The [Iranian] regime’s aggressions still continues—our policies won’t change the behavior. It’s regime change that can solve the Middle East bloodshed. The NCRI’s ten-point plan is a guarantee for a prosperous, democratic and nuclear-free Iran. The NCRI has the broadest support in the US and around the world.” Mrs. Rajavi also sent a message to the demonstration praising the Iranian American community for serving as the voice of the Iranian people. She said: “Your gathering in New York is a resounding ‘No!’ to the policy of appeasement, to the policy of buying chances for a moribund regime, and to the policy of inaction toward a regime that preserves its power through warmongering, terrorism, and suppression. Your gathering says ‘No’ to the continuation of the rule of a bunch of occupiers and criminals in Iran. And, it says ‘Yes’ to the overthrow of this regime by the people of Iran and the Iranian Resistance. You are the voice of protest and resistance by the Iranian people… And you are the voice of the Resistance Units and Councils of Resistance who through their courageous activities across Iran have kept the flames of uprising and protests alive.” She said that after the clerical regime’s attack on Saudi oil facilities, the world needs to follow a policy of decisiveness and firmness against the regime in order to avoid further carnage in Iran and across the world.

It’s regime change that can solve the Middle East bloodshed. The NCRI’s ten-point plan is a guarantee for a prosperous, democratic and nuclear-free Iran. The NCRI has the broadest support in the US and around the world.” Mrs. Rajavi also sent a message to the demonstration praising the Iranian American community for serving as the voice of the Iranian people. She said: “Your gathering in New York is a resounding ‘No!’ to the policy of appeasement, to the policy of buying chances for a moribund regime, and to the policy of inaction toward a regime that preserves its power through warmongering, terrorism, and suppression. Your gathering says ‘No’ to the continuation of the rule of a bunch of occupiers and criminals in Iran. And, it says ‘Yes’ to the overthrow of this regime by the people of Iran and the Iranian Resistance. You are the voice of protest and resistance by the Iranian people… And you are the voice of the Resistance Units and Councils of Resistance who through their courageous activities across Iran have kept the flames of uprising and protests alive.” She said that after the clerical regime’s attack on Saudi oil facilities, the world needs to follow a policy of decisiveness and firmness against the regime in order to avoid further carnage in Iran and across the world.

The demonstrators criticized the mullahs and all appeasement of them, saying that the Regime doesn’t represent the Iranian people and opposition coalition the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) and its President-elect Maryam Rajavi should hold that Iran’s seat in the UN. They said that the UN and other countries should use maximum diplomatic and economic pressure to isolate the regime. The Iranian people have already made clear, through continuous protests, that they want the regime to be overthrown in its entirety; a call that is only expanding because the mullahs are incapable of reform. The former mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani spoke at the rally, saying that the regime will be overthrown and the NCRI will take over and bring freedom to Iran, restoring women’s rights and ending capital punishment.

News article:
By News Desk NEW YORK: Pakistan’s Ambassador to the United Nations, Maleeha Lodhi, has called on the United Nations for action — “not just words” — to deal with the grave crisis stemming from India’s illegal annexation of occupied Kashmir. She also urged the UN to push for the implementation of the Security Council resolutions that pledged the right to self-determination for the Kashmiri people. In an interview with Consortium News, an independent American current affairs television channel, she highlighted the gravity of the situation in the disputed region where people have been suffering under a repressive military lockdown for over a month, and urged UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to take steps to prevent a bigger crisis in South Asia. “What has happened in occupied Jammu and Kashmir is certainly a flashpoint,” Ambassador Lodhi said, while noting that the secretary-general and other UN officials have made statements in the wake of the ongoing crisis that called for a settlement of the Kashmir dispute through dialogue between India and Pakistan in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions and Charter provisions. “But we need action. We just don’t need words. We need action,” she said emphatically. “There are already tensions which are at a peak between India and Pakistan and the situation can snowball into a much bigger crisis,” the Pakistani envoy warned. “So, I think, the UN certainly has long-standing obligations, and it also has immediate obligations, including ending the human rights violations that are going on.” Ambassador Lodhi said Prime Minister Imran Khan was “absolutely right” in repeatedly warning that situation in Kashmir could turn into a bigger crisis. “This is a very fraught situation,” she said. About the UN secretary-general’s role, the Pakistani envoy said his offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute has repeatedly been rejected by India. “So, where are we right now? India refuses to talk to Pakistan, India refuses to accept mediation whether it is mediation offered by President (Donald) Trump or it is offered by UN secretary-general, and India refuses to abide by it human rights commitments. “This is a litany of no, no, no to everything except to repression, oppression, violations and acting with impunity which its occupation forces are doing in Kashmir.” Questioned about Pakistan Army’s statement pledging to exercise all options, Ambassador Lodhi said: “I think that the intent of that statement was to say that we will stand by the people of Jammu and Kashmir, they are not alone, that we would continue to be their protector and that we would continue to speak out for them and whatever we can do and that all diplomatic and political options will be exercised by Pakistan which is exactly what we are doing.” About the possibility of a nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan, she said that Islamabad does not wish to see any kind of conflict. Pakistan, she said, was a responsible nuclear state. She said: “That is why we are urging the international community that it must step in before the bigger crisis. We do not wish to see a bigger crisis. There is a crisis that is going on now in Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. “The crisis has affected the daily lives of men, women and children and before it gets out of hand, it’s important that the international community acts to prevent any bigger crisis.” At the outset of the interview, Lodhi explained to her audience the main features of the decades-old Kashmir dispute, and said: “The story of Kashmir is a story of monumental tragedy, of broken promises, human rights violations, military occupation and what we see today: a curfew that has lasted for over 32 days with all of Jammu and Kashmir being turned into and armed cage, with people not even allowed to come out of their homes.” Asked whether India’s actions in Kashmir could be compared to what Israel was doing in the Palestinian territories, she said both issues are “about the plight of the people who have been dispossessed, who have seen their liberty taken away from them in every possible way”. She added: “So, I think when we talk about the people of occupied Kashmir, we must remember this is about people who are in deep distress, who are held prisoners in their own land, who are not free, whose children cannot go to school. “What you are looking at is a situation of deep distress. And I think the fact that human rights organisations — like Amnesty, like Human Rights Watch, like the Committee for the Protection of Journalists are all speaking out, they are calling out India’s outrageous behaviour and its cruelty to the people of Occupied Kashmir.”

News article:
The international community, especially the US, views Kashmir as a bone of contention between two nuclear-armed nations. A potential nuclear engagement between Pakistan and India is perceived to be a security concern arising out of this conflict. The two nations have gone to war over Kashmir four times — 1948, 1965, 1971, and 1999. However, there is a graver threat brewing in Kashmir. The US is ignoring Kashmir at its own peril.When Saddam’s forces invaded Kuwait, the Saudis feared they were next. Osama bin Laden offered to help protect Saudi Arabia with his battle-hardened Mujahideen fighters. The Saudis rejected his offer and instead invited the Americans to protect against a potential invasion by Saddam.Bin Laden was deeply offended. He loathed the idea of infidel forces setting their feet in the Holy Land. He turned against the US and declared a holy war (Jihad) against it. This background is important to understand why al Qaeda became anti-America. Another reason was the American support for Israel. Israel’s creation among the Palestinians is commemorated as the Nakba Day (the Day of the Catastrophe). Ever since, Israel has been on a never-ending quest to grab more and more Palestinian land by never defining its permanent borders.Israel is a nuclear-armed state, though it never officially acknowledges it. And the West has comfortably looked the other way. The US covertly and overtly supported Israel in its atrocious activities, always vetoing any UN resolution against Israel. All this generated a lot of anger against the US. Public opinion especially in the Arab world has been against Israeli actions and by extension against the US for its support.India is a similar US ally as it shares with Israel the occupation and annexation of a land that does not belong to it. Kashmir is the world’s most densely militarised zone with close to a million Indian soldiers deployed there. In a deja vu, the US is choosing to look the other way. This Sunday, President Trump will join Modi at a gathering of Indian-Americans in Houston, Texas. The event is dubbed with a Texas twang as “Howdy Modi!” The disgruntled youth of Kashmir will not forget this tacit American support.It is natural for the Kashmiris to be completely disillusioned eventually and follow the jihadists’ path. Those jihadists fought against the domestic tyrant (near enemy) as the concept of takfir dictated, without losing sight of the distant enemy supporting the near enemy. Chalmers Johnson in his book Blowback warned before 9/11 that the US government’s actions in foreign countries will have consequences. The heat from Kashmir will reach far and wide. Ignoring Kashmir will make ISIS task of recruiting angry young men very easy.With no education, job, and a promising future these Kashmiri men would be driven into the arms of ISIS and al Qaeda. Lawrence Wright in The Looming Tower explained how humiliation causes young disgruntled men to join terror groups to take revenge. Humiliation drove many to abandon their families and go on a kamikaze mission called 9/11. It caused the Afghans to fight against the Soviets, created the Taliban, and is continuing to cause resistance to aggression around the world. Kashmir is where every individual, regardless of age and gender, faced humiliation by the occupying Indian army. The world should brace for impact.If the US continues to ignore Kashmir, the future may cause terrorism created by Indian aggression in Kashmir to reach the West, because terrorists also believe in guilt by association. I sincerely hope that it doesn’t happen and if it does, the world would have enough decency to not ask “Why do they hate us?”Published in The Express Tribune, September 19, 2019.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.

News article:
Prime Minister Imran Khan visited Saudi Arabia last week before heading to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly session. The main purpose of his visit to Riyadh was to garner the support of the Kingdom for Pakistan’s row with India over Kashmir. But just days before his meeting with the Saudi King and Crown Prince, the Saudi oil facilities were struck by missiles. The unprecedented attacks carried out through drones shut down the Kingdom’s half of oil production but significantly sparked fears of a war in the already volatile Middle East. Saudi Arabia and the US have accused Iran of being behind the attack, although Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed the responsibility. Against this backdrop, Prime Minister Imran visited Saudi Arabia and naturally much of the discussions remained focused on the brewing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. An official handout issued by the Prime Minister Office in Islamabad said Imran briefed the Saudi leadership about the current situation in Kashmir. The statement went on to say that the Saudi King and the Crown Prince expressed concerns over the situation and reiterated their support for the Kashmir cause. Interestingly, the statement carried by the official news agency of Saudi Arabia did not mention Kashmir. The Saudi statement only talked about the attack on oil facility and Prime Minister Imran’s condemnation. This shows that the developing situation in the Middle East has thrown yet another challenge for Pakistan on the foreign policy front. Any conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran will have serious implications for Pakistan. The major challenge for Islamabad is to stay away from this brewing Iran-Saudi tension. But it is not going to be easy given the fact that Pakistan has a strategic pact with Saudi Arabia, according to which, it has to come to the rescue of the Kingdom if it comes under attack. Suppose if the US and Saudi Arabia launched an attack against Iran, and Tehran retaliates, will Pakistan take sides or stay neutral? And this is not the only repercussion that Pakistan may face. The Iran-Saudi conflict will surely raise oil prices in the international market and this naturally will impact Pakistan’s economy which is already reeling from one shock to another.Also if current tensions in the Middle East translated into a serious conflict, this will certainly distract the world’s attention from the unrest in India-Occupied Kashmir. And this is something that Pakistan would never want. Since India revoked the special status of the disputed territory on August 5, Islamabad has launched a diplomatic offensive against India. One of the reasons that Kashmir gets global traction is because of the unprecedented converge given by the international press. This naturally has benefited Pakistan’s narrative. But the developing situation in the Middle East can potentially change that proposition.What has made Pakistan’s work cut out is the sudden deadlock in the Afghan peace process. With tension growing by the day with India over Kashmir, Pakistan was hoping that a peace deal in Afghanistan would help its cause. Peace in Afghanistan would not only have secured the western border but also opened a real possibility of reviving otherwise faltering ties with the US. And an improved relationship with Washington could only enhance Islamabad’s options on Kashmir. It was because of this reason that Pakistan felt more disappointed than any other country when President Trump suddenly pulled out of the peace talks with the Taliban. At a time when Pakistan wanted to solely focus on Kashmir, it now also has to deal with increased instability in Afghanistan as well as lurking fears of a possible conflict in the Middle East. Islamabad never wanted this three-way challenge. These testing times will undoubtedly test the mettle and skills of those sitting at the helm in Pakistan.Published in The Express Tribune, September 23, 2019.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.

Prime Minister Imran Khan during media talk before bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump in New York. Pic Imran Khan Facebook NEW YORK: Minister for Foreign Affairs Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Monday said US President Donald Trump had mandated Prime Minister Imran Khan to mediate between the United States and Iran. He was speaking to reporters here about the meeting between the two leaders on the sidelines of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly. Qureshi said the prime minister would discuss the issue with the Iranian leadership to find a way out. More: Qureshi discusses security matters with Iranian FM The foreign minister said the prime minister has made it clear to the US president that the region could not afford any war, as any imprudent action would draw drastic consequences. During the Saudi visit too, the prime minister had suggested an amicable solution to the US-Iran standoff. To a question, the foreign minister said President Trump had expressed trust in the Prime Minister Imran Khan’s leadership. He said PM Khan had explained Pakistan’s clear, categorical and firm stance on Kashmir, Afghanistan and Iran to President Trump. “The prime minister talked on three issues. There was no ambiguity in it. It had no flexibility,” he added. Related: PM Imran meets Iranian President Hassan Rouhani He said the prime minister told President Trump that a humanitarian crisis had developed in the Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir where eight million people were living under siege with their basic human rights usurped. He said President Trump was told that India would only listen to the United States so it should play its role. He said both the US and the UN Security Council will have to play their part if they wanted to avert bloodshed in the occupied territory. He said the prime minister also apprised the US leadership of Pakistan’s facilitative and constructive role in the Afghan peace process that was also acknowledged by Secretary Mike Pompeo.

Prime Minister Imran Kahn speaks during a news conference held on the sidelines of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly at UN headquarters in New York City. PHOTO: REUTERS Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Tuesday that United States President Donald Trump had asked him to help defuse tensions with Iran and that he had already spoken with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in an attempt to mediate.The United States blames Iran for an attack on the world's biggest crude oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia on September 14 and has said they will present evidence to back that up.Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group, which has been fighting a Saudi-led military coalition since 2015, has claimed responsibility. Iran denies involvement.Imran met with Trump on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations on Monday. "I immediately spoke to President Rouhani yesterday after the meeting with President Trump, but I can't say anything right now more than this except that we're trying and mediating," Imran told reporters at the United Nations on Tuesday.The premier said he had been in Saudi Arabia before New York and spoken with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who also asked him to talk to Rouhani.An already-tense relationship between Iran and the United States has worsened over the past year since Trump withdrew from a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and world powers, saying it did not go far enough, and reimposed sanctions on Iran as part of a "maximum pressure" policy.In response, Iran has gradually reduced its commitments to limit uranium enrichment activity under the pact and plans further breaches if European parties fail to keep their promises to shield Iran's economy from US sanctions.In his speech to the UN on Tuesday, Trump said there was a path to peace with Iran while he denounced its leadership for "bloodlust."When asked about Imran's remarks, Trump said the prime minister would like to mediate "and we have a very good relationship and there's a chance that that could happen.""A lot of people would like to get us to the table. We'llsee what happens but so far we have not agreed to a meeting," Trump said on a possible meeting with Rouhani while they are both in New York this week.PM Imran also said he had told Trump that he was willing to help broker peace in neighboring Afghanistan.Hundreds of civilians have been killed in fighting across Afghanistan after the collapse of US-Taliban peace talks this month. The Taliban has said Trump would regret his decision to abruptly call off talks that could have led to a political settlement to end the 18-year-old war."We are trying now to get the talks restarted between Taliban and the Americans and hopefully the deal is signed," said the premier. "Then I will try and meet the Taliban to convince them to talk to the Afghan government because until now that's where the hitch was - Taliban were talking to the Americans but not to the Afghan government," he said.

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan, continuing with his “Mission Kashmir”, raised Indian brutalities in held Kashmir during high-level engagements with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Turkish President Reccip Tayyip Erdogan and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly. Prime Minister Khan met Rouhani and discussed the current situation in Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, created by India’s unilateral and illegal actions that pose a grave risk to regional peace and security, a PM House statement said on Tuesday. The Prime Minister emphasised the urgent need for India to lift the curfew and other restrictions imposed on the Kashmiri population for 50 days. He also thanked the Iranian leadership, especially Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, for “expressing unequivocal support for the Kashmiri people and their legitimate rights”. Both sides reviewed their bilateral relations and discussed regional developments. Khan also met Turkish President Erdogan and discussed the ongoing situation in Indian-held Kashmir with him. The two leaders reaffirmed their desire to continue standing by each other in the face of all challenges, a press release said. Separately, the Prime Minister Imran Khan met his Italian counterpart Giuseppe Conte and briefed him on the legal, humanitarian and peace and security dimension of the situation in occupied Kashmir. The two leaders discussed a wide range of bilateral, regional and multilateral issues of mutual interest, a PM House statement said. Earlier, Prime Minister Khan attended UN’s Climate Action Summit, and spoke to dozens of heads of states and governments, business leaders, and senior civil society representatives from around the world, who lined up to promise far-reaching steps to beat climate change at the UN’s New York headquarters. “We are raising our ambition and acting in ways to help lower world green house gas numbers,” Khan said at the gathering. Khan referred to the success of his government’s Billion Tree Tsunami project in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and said work had begun to plant 10 billion trees across Pakistan in the next four years. Pakistan, he said, had committed $50 million to an independent “eco-system restoration fund” aimed at conserving biodiversity, generating green jobs, alleviating poverty and energizing the country’s youth to become custodians of a green future. “We look forward to support from bilateral and multilateral partners. Pakistan’s contribution to global Green House Gases (GHG) was miniscule—less than 1 per cent—yet, the impact of climate change on Pakistan is far greater,” the Prime Minister said.

News article:
NEW YORK/ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday brushed aside the possibility of any talks between Pakistan and India unless and until the latter lifted curfew in the Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IOJK). “Unless and until they lift curfew, there is no chance of talking with India,” Imran Khan told a press conference here. To a question about the possibility of his meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of ongoing 74th United Nations General Assembly session, he said before August 5, Pakistan tried everything and he himself spoke to Prime Minister Modi but sadly there was no positive response from the other side. But after August 5, there was no point in talking with India, he added. The prime minister described the August 5 unilateral and illegal Indian action - which eliminated the special status of an internationally accepted disputed territory by revoking Article 370 of their constitution and the continued oppression as just a beginning, saying the situation would worsen. Imran Khan said he feared change of demography by India in the occupied piece of land [IOJ&K] and also feared massacre of Kashmiris by 900,000 Indian troops after lifting of curfew. He said he was in New York to highlight what was going on in the IOJ&K and the potential it had for the two nuclear armed countries coming face to face. The blockade of eight million people in the IOJ&K by 900,000 Indian troops, he said, was unprecedented and inhuman. Expressing his disappointment over the international community’s attitude, the prime minister said the United Nations Security Council resolutions, which promised the resolution of dispute through a plebiscite for the Kashmiris to exercise their right of self-determination, had been pending for the last 70 years. “I am a bit disappointed by international community,” he said and questioned what would be the reaction of world if eight million Europeans, Jews or even eight Americans were put under siege. He highlighted the deteriorating situation in the IOJ&K and urged the world as well as the United Nations to intervene and help address the issue by saying, “Now it is the time for the UN and the world to act.” The prime minister thanked President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey for raising the issue of Kashmir during his speech at the UN General Assembly. He said the Turkish president would be visiting Pakistan next month. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Imran Khan Tuesday said Pakistan was trying to mediate on the situation in Middle East and he had also contacted the Iranian leadership in that respect. “Yes I spoke to President Hassan Rouhani of Iran yesterday. We are trying to mediate. I cannot say more about it,” Imran Khan told a news conference. When asked as if United States President Donald Trump had asked him for mediation, the prime minister said before his meeting with the US president he was also asked by the Saudi leadership to talk to the Iranian president. He said he did not believe that conflicts could help resolve anything. He in this context also referred to the situation in Afghanistan and said that Pakistan was trying to get the US-Taliban talks resumed. Prime Minister Imran Khan met Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of 74th session of the UN General Assembly and thanked the Iranian leadership for expressing unequivocal support for the Kashmiri people and their legitimate rights. Both sides reviewed their bilateral relations and discussed regional developments, a PM House statement issued here Tuesday said. The prime minister underscored Pakistan’s desire to further strengthen good neighbourly relations with Iran and build mutually beneficial cooperation in diverse areas. He thanked the Iranian leadership, especially Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, for expressing unequivocal support for the Kashmiri people and their legitimate rights. The prime minister also discussed the current situation in Indian Occupied Jammu & Kashmir, created by India’s unilateral and illegal actions that pose a grave risk to regional peace and security. Speaking on the gross human rights violations in IOJ&K, the Prime Minister emphasised the urgent need to lift curfew and other restrictions imposed on Kashmiri population for 50 days. Both sides agreed to fast track implementation of the bilateral agreements, concluded during the visit of Prime Minister Imran Khan to Iran, earlier this year. Prime Minister Imran Khan met Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy on the sidelines of 74th Session of the UN General Assembly in New York and briefed him on the legal, humanitarian and peace and security dimension of the situation in Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The two leaders discussed a wide range of bilateral, regional and multilateral issues of mutual interest, a PM House statement issued here said. The prime minister called for the immediate lifting of all restrictions including the curfew, release of all prisoners, stop in the use of pellet guns, and respect for the human rights of Kashmiri people. He also underlined the importance of the international community acting urgently to ward off threats to peace and security and facilitate peaceful resolution of the dispute in Jammu and Kashmir. In the bilateral context the two sides agreed to enhance mutual cooperation in the political, trade and economic, defence production, cultural and educational domains.

News article:
Around two months after ending the special status of India-Occupied Kashmir (IOK), New Delhi’s next move is to ensure the total absorption of the occupied territory in the Indian Union. This would require implementing steps to allow Indian nationals to buy property, cast their vote and permanently settle in the disputed state, the implications of which will be far-reaching.A major impediment to annex IOK in the Indian Union was removed on August 5 when the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganization Act was passed. After two months, there is no indication that the Indian government intends to undo this action. On the contrary, Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar asserted that India’s next move would be to seek control over Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.During this time, except for statements, speeches, and demonstrations in Pakistan and across the world, nothing substantial has been achieved to compel India to review its unilateral act of ending IOK’s special status. New Delhi has neither released the thousands of Kashmiris, including children, it arrested, nor restored communication networks or lifted the curfew in the Valley. Based on its past acts of annexing Hyderabad Deccan, Junagarh, Goa and occupying Siachen, India is now systematically implementing its age-old plan to transform the demographic complexion of the Muslim-dominated Kashmir Valley. And who can undermine the fact that India took advantage of the 1971 crisis in then East Pakistan and invaded it, which resulted in the creation of Bangladesh? Since then, India has repeatedly reminded the world of its role in the breakup of Pakistan and gotten away with blatant aggression.If the Kashmir Valley is emerging as the West Bank of India, it means India is replicating the Israeli policy of launching Jewish settlements and annexing a major chunk of the occupied land. In June 1967 during the Arab-Israeli war, Israel occupied the Palestinian territory of West Bank, including East Jerusalem which was at that time under Jordan’s control. UNSC Resolutions 242 and 338 calls upon Israel to withdraw its forces from the Arab-occupied areas including the West Bank. After 52 years, Israel has not only annexed East Jerusalem where the Al Aqsa Mosque is located but also shifted its capital from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Israel, while violating the UNSC resolutions, has established hundreds of Jewish settlements causing a serious demographic tilt in favour of the Jewish population. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu recently announced that if re-elected, he will annex a sizeable part of the West Bank. Henceforth, it is the Israeli model of West Bank which India is duplicating in its occupied Valley of Muslim-majority Kashmir.Since India has already declared Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir as union territories, it needs to ensure that at least five million Indians settle in the Valley in the next few years. The remaining almost eight million Muslim Kashmiris will be neutralised either by displacement or by being pushed across the LoC. Till the time the Valley transforms into a non-Muslim territory, Indian military and paramilitary force will stay there and J&K State Assembly elections will not be held.Is it possible for India to replicate the Israelisation of West Bank as Indianisation of the Valley? Why is the Modi regime so confident that it will get away with this? Has any political or diplomatic damage been done to India in the last two months? Pakistan’s attempts of raising the Kashmir issue in the UNSC or in the annual General Assembly session under PM Khan’s “Kashmir mission” may not have a significant impact on the Indian psyche because of two main reasons.First, no resolution in the Security Council has been presented assailing India of unilaterally ending IOK’s special status. Nor has any pressure been exerted by Pakistan across the LoC to deter Indian authorities from committing severe human rights violations including arresting children, dishonouring Muslim Kashmiri women and depriving eight million people of basic necessities.Second, apart from statements and protest marches across the world, Kashmiris have been prevented from launching large-scale popular protests in the Valley. Using deception as a tool, the Modi regime tried to break the tempo of any popular resistance thereby arguing that the case is with the Indian Supreme Court and if the court declares the August 5 reorganisation act null and void, it will accept the verdict. The skilful and shrewd approach of Modi’s regime is to gain time and raise hope in the Valley for justice from the superior judiciary. And, while hearing petitions against the imposition of curfew and other punitive measures of the Indian government in IOK, the Indian Supreme Court refused to pass any order and merely asked the High Court of J&K and the state government to ease things for the people of the Valley. How can one expect the court to do anything if it’s reluctant to pass a judgment which will seriously impede the central government’s credibility?There are strong indications that India may get away with its absorption of the occupied territory and transforming the Valley into something like the Israeli-occupied once Palestinian-majority West Bank. So far, there is no major opposition in India against the BJP’s policy. The Indian security establishment and its political allies led by the BJP think that Pakistan lacks the capability to challenge India militarily or arrange the crossing of LoC by scores of Kashmiris in Azad Kashmir, to confront Indian security forces. That is why, they believe, PM Imran Khan recently warned that no Pakistani should attempt to cross the LoC. Whereas addressing a public meeting in Chakothi, the Azad Kashmir PM warned no one can dare stop Kashmiris from crossing the LoC. The Indian government is aware of Pakistan’s economic situation and political confrontation between the government and the opposition over the arrests of key PPP and PML-N leaders, and the proposed march on Islamabad by JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman to force the PTI government to quit.In the absence of any clear support for Pakistan in passing a resolution against India in the UNSC or calling a special session of the UN General Assembly, New Delhi is quietly working on implementing its plan to change Kashmir’s demography. Pakistan is doing its best to expose villainous India internationally. But rendering sacrifices for the suppressed Muslim population of the occupied Valley would require direct action; and not just holding seminars or conferences in five-star hotels or arranging foreign tours at the taxpayers’ expense.A national liberation movement cannot be launched by mere slogans but requires targeting the enemy to effectively deter it from continuing its brutalities. Most importantly, by missing the September 19 deadline for presenting a resolution in the UNHRC on India’s violations of human rights in IOK, Pakistan missed a valuable opportunity to expose New Delhi at the international level. As time passes, the Modi regime in collaboration with President Trump is gaining confidence to legally shape its occupation of the Valley.Published in The Express Tribune, September 27, 2019.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.

News article:
The lingering Kashmir issue came under renewed international focus with growing calls on Saturday for its peaceful settlement in accordance with the United Nations (UN) resolutions, just a day after Prime Minister Imran Khan's powerful speech at the UN General Assembly (UNGA).Malaysian Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad said on Saturday that Kashmir "has been invaded and occupied" despite the UN resolution on the issue. While Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for a peaceful resolution of the dispute based on the UN Charter and Security Council resolutions.In his maiden address to the 74th session of the General Assembly on Friday, Prime Minister Imran tugged at world conscience over Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir, asking "will the world go for a market of 1.2 billion people, or for justice and humanity".Taking the podium later, Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamad discussed several issues facing the Muslim countries and drew the attention of the 193-member General Assembly towards the plight of the Muslims in conflict zones such as Kashmir, Palestine, Myanmar and others.Calling for settling the Kashmir dispute through "peaceful means", he regretted that despite the UN resolutions Kashmir "has been invaded and occupied"."There might be reasons for this action, but it is still wrong," said Mahathir, warning: "Ignoring the UN would lead to other forms of disregard for the UN and the rule of law."On the question of Palestine, Mahathir said the first action of the UN was the creation of Israel, seizing Arab land and expelling 90% of the Arab population."The result was terrorism when there was none before, or not on the present scale."He said that Malaysia accepts Israel as a fait accompli but cannot accept Jewish settlements or occupation of Jerusalem.Turning to the Rohingya issue, he noted many colonies in the West had expelled natives from their countries, but never as brutally as in Myanmar. "The Rohingya dare not return to Myanmar because they could not trust its military, due to the helplessness of the world in stopping atrocities."The Malaysian premier said that Muslims were accused of terrorism even if they did nothing, while their states were destabilised by regime change. "There were no massive migrations in the past, but now wars and regime change have forced people to flee their countries."Noting that democracy was not the easiest form of government to operate, especially when it is adopted overnight, he called for time for gradual change."Otherwise the result is violence, civil wars or new more harsh regimes."Earlier, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi raised the Kashmir issue in his address to the General Assembly on Friday, calling for a peaceful resolution of the dispute between Pakistan and India based on the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements.In a blunt speech at the annual General Assembly, the Chinese government's top diplomat also said that tariffs and trade disputes could plunge the world into recession and Beijing was committed to resolving them in a "calm, rational and cooperative manner".Yi said Kashmir issue was a dispute left from history and should be properly and peacefully resolved based on the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements. "China opposes any unilateral actions that complicated the situation," he said.Taking a clear swipe at US President Donald Trump, who started a damaging trade war on China nearly 15 months ago, Wang said the lessons of the Great Depression should not be forgotten."Erecting walls will not resolve global challenges, and blaming others for one's own problems does not work," he said.Earlier this week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for a solution through dialogue for the Kashmir dispute in his address at the General Assembly.Erdogan criticised the international community for failing to pay attention to the Kashmir conflict, which he said, awaited solution for 72 years.Prime Minister Imran spoke to the General Assembly on Friday. In his address, he emphasised that the world community had a responsibility to ensure that the Kashmiris get their right to self-determination as enshrined in several Security Council resolutions, warning that if a conventional war started between Pakistan and India, anything could happen.The prime minister's powerful address touched nerves in India. Exercising right to reply to Imran's speech, Indian External Affairs Ministry First Secretary Vidisha Maitra lashed out at Pakistan for highlighting the plight of the Kashmiri people.She reiterated the Indian rhetoric, accusing Pakistan of "terrorism and hate speech" and "trying to play its wild card as the newfound champion of human rights".She said that Imran's warning of potential nuclear war over Kashmir was not appropriate to "statesmanship".Meanwhile, India's external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, on Saturday, termed Chinese Foreign Minister Yi's call for a peaceful resolution to Kashmir dispute an attack on his country's "sovereignty and territorial integrity".He claimed that Kashmir was India's internal matter and "we expect that other countries will ... desist from efforts to change the status quo through the illegal so-called China-Pakistan Economic Corridor."

Talking to the media here on Saturday, she said that Prime Minister Imran Khan jolted the conscience of the world about the prolonged Indian state terrorism in occupied Jammu and Kashmir.

Dr Firdous said that prime minister not only effectively represented the whole Muslim Ummah in his address at the UN General Assembly, but also presented the true face and a real picture of Islam before the world. Dr Firdous said that Pakistan has made it clear before the world that Pakistan would not recognise Israel till the peaceful solution of Palestine and Kashmir disputes.

News article:
The leader of the Pakistani side of divided Kashmir is hopeful that India's clampdown in the Himalayan territory has reached a turning point -- bringing US pressure. Sardar Masood Khan was visiting Washington to meet lawmakers, media and experts after India on August 5 rescinded autonomy on its side and sharply curtailed ordinary people's communications. "There is a palpable shift in the United States," Khan, president of the section that Pakistanis call "Azad," or "Free," Kashmir, told AFP. "The pro-India sentiment here in the United States prior to the August 5 steps was very strong because of the strong economic and strategic ties between the United States and India. But this is changing fast," he said. As evidence, he pointed to how a number of lawmakers have criticized the Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi's policies in what had been India's sole Muslim-majority state. This week, 14 Democrats led by Representative Pramila Jayapal urged Modi to restore internet and cellular service for Kashmiris, saying in a letter that US residents had been unable to reach relatives. President Donald Trump has literally rallied behind Modi, joining him at a mass gathering last month in Houston, but the State Department has asked India to bring back communications and release detained political leaders. Khan said he was also grateful to US and international media, who have faced restrictions in Indian Kashmir. "The media has after decades spoken up for the people of Jammu and Kashmir and not the Indian establishment, so that's a major change," he said. India justifies its measures by saying it wanted to better integrate Kashmir and was trying to avoid trouble stirred up by Pakistan, which it accuses of arming and training guerillas. 'Seething with anger' Kashmir, the trigger for two full-fledged wars between the nuclear-armed powers, has long inflamed passions in both countries. Prime Minister Imran Khan, addressing the United Nations last week, accused India of plotting a "bloodbath" by sending in troops. But he has also publicly discouraged infiltration into the Indian side, which he said would hurt the cause. Sardar Masood Khan said that youths in Pakistani Kashmir were "seething with anger" and wanted to "fight for the rights of their brothers and sisters." "While we respect their sentiments and we share their sentiments, we do not want any unregulated activity across the Line of Control," he said. India also ended restrictions on non-Kashmiris buying land in the Himalayan territory formerly known as Jammu and Kashmir. Khan accused India of following an Israeli model, encouraging Hindus to settle in Kashmir and "reduce the Kashmiri or Muslim majority in the state." But Khan said he recognized the rights of Kashmir's historic Hindu community, known as Pandits. Some 200,000 Pandits fled the Kashmir Valley after an insurgency against India erupted in 1989. "They should be brought back, they should be reintegrated into the mainstream and they should be given all sorts of guarantees for their protection -- physical protection and protection of their rights," Khan said. 'Grateful' to China Khan, a former Pakistani ambassador to Beijing, hailed the role of China which arranged a rare Security Council meeting on Kashmir in August. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also mentioned Kashmir in his address to the United Nations, calling for neither side to "unilaterally change the status quo." "The people of Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan are grateful to China for speaking up for the Kashmiris," Khan said. The United States has questioned why Pakistan is not also raising concerns about China, which according to rights groups has detained around one million Uighurs and other Muslims in re-education camps in western Xinjiang region in a step Washington says is reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Khan -- who accused India of "genocide" in Kashmir -- said that the two situations were "completely different." "Occupied Kashmir is a disputed territory that doesn't belong to India and what they're doing now is colonization," he said. Speaking of his past experiences in Xinjiang, Khan said China was "taking affirmative action to develop the region economically" and to "integrate" ethnic groups. Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar, who was also visiting Washington, said China had no business raising Kashmir as New Delhi had not changed the status quo on the international front. But he also declined to join US criticism of China on Xinjiang, saying: "Human rights comments are a much greater part of the Western political culture than the Asian."

We stand for the basic human dignity of Kashmiris & support democracy, equality, and human rights for all - including the most vulnerable. Reports of violence & torture are extremely concerning, and the blockade from communication and life-saving medical care must end. https://t.co/EHWHIdexwe — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 30, 2019 Joining the chorus of American lawmakers, another US congressperson has voiced solidarity with the people of Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK), saying "blockade from communication and life-saving medical care must end".In a Twitter post, Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said: "We stand for the basic human dignity of Kashmiris & support democracy, equality, and human rights for all - including the most vulnerable."The disputed Himalayan valley has been under lockdown since August 5 when Prime Minister Modi-led government revoked its special status and imposed severe restrictions including curfew and communication blockade along with deploying thousands of additional occupation forces to head off protests against its illegal move.Expressing her serious concerns over the human rights violations by Indian forces in the Muslim-majority state, the lawmaker said "reports of violence and torture are "extremely concerning”.She also shared a video posted by a user, in which she can be seen participating in a "solidarity march" on Kashmir and scribbling a message on a huge coloured chart board."Our entire community's prayers and support are with the families of Kashmir, as we work to establish peace and justice there and throughout the world,” the congresswoman had written on the chart board.Ocasio-Cortez stands out in American politics by her determination to avoid accepting lobbyist money for her campaigns.Earlier in the day, a delegation of US Congressmen called on Foreign Minister Qureshi and discussed with him the bilateral relations, the situation in occupied Kashmir as well as other matters of mutual interest.During the meeting, Qureshi informed the Demoratic party congressmen that Pakistan valued its relationship with the US. “Both the countries have jointly fought terrorism, and faced the regional challenges together,” he said.Both sides agreed to boost their cooperation in trade and other areas. Qureshi said that the Pakistan government had introduced a new visa regime to facilitate the businessmen. He also highlighted greater business opportunities in Pakistan.The foreign minister stressed the need for the world community to play its role for the lifting of restriction imposed by the Indian government on occupied Kashmir, which was continuing for the past 58 days.The foreign minister said Pakistan would continue to play its due role for regional peace. He reminded the delegation that Prime Minister Imran Khan during his recent visit to the US emphasised the need for resumption of talks with the Taliban.With additional input from Anadolu Agency

MULTAN: Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has said that Pakistan’s stance on Kashmir has never been weak and the main problem it faces is the weak economy. Qureshi said former judge of Indian supreme court Justice Markandey Katju has rightly said that India had sown seeds for large-scale guerrilla war in Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) by stripping the territory of its special status. Delivering the keynote address at the annual national conference titled ''Hazrat Bahauddin Zakariya (RA) Teachings and Social Harmony'' here Thursday, the minister said that senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad also portrayed a horrible picture of IOK on his return to India after staying there for six days. He said India has imposed curfew and restrictions in IOK for the last two months, but it failed to shatter the courage of brave Kashmiris. He said that the Kashmir fight was a long fight; it was not a T20, but a Test match which could only be won by a team which had a holistic approach. The minister said that the world is praising Pakistan’s narrative and the international media like New York Times, Washington Post, Telegraph, CNN, BBC and others were supporting Pakistan’s viewpoint. He said human rights organisations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, which set the world’s narrative, are praising Pakistan’s approach. Regarding recent visit of Pakistani delegation led by Prime Minister Imran Khan to the United Nations, he said that they held 120 meetings with P5 global leaders and foreign ministers of different countries in seven-day stay and interacted with the media. On Saudi-Iran tensions, he said that Prime Minister Imran Khan discussed the issue with US President Donald Trump, Saudi crown prince, Iranian president and US secretary of state and tried to normalise the situation. About Islamophobia, he said that it was unjust to link terrorism with Islam. "Does terrorism has a religion," he asked. Shah Mehmood said that he was satisfied with his meeting with the Taliban delegation led by Mulla Abdul Ghani Baradar in Islamabad and discussion about resumption of dialogue with the US. About south Punjab youth job opportunities, he said that he would talk to Punjab chief minister about it. “We have the relationship of religion and faith with our Kashmiri brethren and we all are followers of Sufi saints,” he said, adding that the Sufi saints built mosques but never demolished temples. He said the Sufi approach towards life is aimed at making society inclusive and following bringing the nation together.

News article:
(Adds background context) ISLAMABAD, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan is likely to visit Saudi Arabia and Iran, the foreign office in Islamabad said on Thursday, weeks after Islamabad said Washington had asked it to mediate with Tehran. "The possibility of a visit of the prime minister to Saudi Arabia and Iran is on the cards and I will update you as things unfold," foreign office spokesman, Mohammad Fasisal, told a news briefing. The announcement of the possible visit comes after Khan last month described a request by U.S. President Donald Trump, asking the Pakistani leader to help defuse tensions with Iran. Washington had blamed Tehran for an attack on the world's biggest crude oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia. Faisal declined to comment when asked whether the visit was related to the mediation request. Tensions have elevated between Iran and Saudi Arabia since the attack, which took place on Sept. 14. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group, which has been fighting a Saudi-led military coalition since 2015, has claimed responsibility, but Washington and Riyadh say they believe the attack came from the opposite direction and blame Iran. Iran denies involvement. Khan said after a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York that he was "trying and mediating" and had also spoken with Iran's President Hassan Rouhani. Khan has ramped up his government's engagement on the international stage, offering to negotiate regional tensions. He has separately proposed to Trump that Pakistan could help broker peace in neighbouring Afghanistan. Last week Pakistani government ministers met with both Taliban representatives and the U.S. peace envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, in Islamabad while Pakistan's foreign minister called for a resumption in stalled peace talks between the Taliban and Washington. The Taliban also met with Khalilzad, sources told Reuters, the first known contact since Trump halted talks last month, though officials said the talks did not represent a formal resumption of negotiations.

Foreign policy experts on Thursday noted that the geopolitical environment was favouring Pakistan’s initiative for mediation in the Persian Gulf, but called for cautious optimism about the prospect of success.These views were expressed at a round table conference titled ‘Mediation in the Persian Gulf: Initiatives, Strategies and Obstacles’ hosted by Islamabad Policy Institute (IPI), an Islamabad based think tank, on the eve of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s upcoming mediation trip to Iran and Saudi Arabia.The discussion was attended by a large number of retired diplomats, ex-military officers, members of academia, and representatives of think tanks and members of civil society.Former foreign secretary Aizaz Chaudhry said that despite huge obstacles including the massive mistrust between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and regional power play, Pakistan was the best-suited country for such a role because of its strong credentials with both countries. He emphasised that the geopolitical environment was conducive for the effort, no matter how little space was available for making progress.He proposed that PM Imran Khan should warn leaders of both countries about the consequences of war, not just for the two countries, but for the larger region and the world at large; seek a minimum common agenda on which the effort could be taken forward; offer to host a summit or a senior leadership meeting of both countries in Pakistan; and renew good offices to both countries.Pakistan’s former ambassador to Iran Asif Durrani observed that good sense had prevailed with Saudi Arabia after realizing that the war in Yemen was not going their way even after four years. He emphasised the need for confidence-building measures between Iran and Saudi Arabia for the peace effort to progress. He called on the Iranian government to build trust with Riyadh by addressing its concerns with respect to Houthis in Yemen.Prof Dr Qandeel Abbas said there was a need to change the narrative about Iran – Saudi conflict from a sectarian one to that of power contestation in which both countries were trying to secure their interests. This, he believed, would help in resolving the dispute.Arab Affairs Analyst Ali Mehr was sceptical about the mediation initiative and said that Imran Khan could at the best play the role of a messenger between the two countries. He warned about the US role and influence on Saudi Arabia saying it could prevent any breakthrough in the initiative.Mehr suggested that the prime minister’s efforts should be exclusively focused on finding some solution to the Yemen war. He further proposed that Pakistan should join hands with Iraq and Oman to make more of an effort to encourage reconciliation between Iran and Saudi Arabia.IPI Executive Director Prof Sajjad Bokhari said Pakistan, which has legitimate political, economic and security interests in the region, cannot remain completely removed from the effects of developments in the Middle East. Therefore, it is important that Pakistan’s interests be secured in the face of unpredictable circumstances by working for peace in the region.Published in The Express Tribune, October 11, 2019.

News article:
Prime Minister Imran Khan is set to visit Tehran on Sunday as part of Pakistan’s efforts to defuse worsening tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, officials said on Friday.The groundwork for the prime minister’s mediation tour was laid during an unannounced visit of a top government official to Iran and Saudi Arabia in the last week of September, sources with the knowledge of the discreet diplomacy told The Express Tribune.During his visit to both the capitals, the official held talks with senior Iranian and Saudi authorities to help defuse tensions.

As Islamabad is becoming increasingly wary of an escalating conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has set out on a mission to defuse tension between the Middle Eastern rivals. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan held talks with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in Tehran on Sunday. He was also scheduled to meet with Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and other high-ranking Iranian officials. The purpose of his Iran visit, according to Pakistan's government, is to "promote peace and security in the region." It is Khan's second visit to Iran this year. "I told Prime Minster Imran [Khan] we welcome any gesture by Pakistan for peace in the region and appreciate his visit to our country," said Rouhani at a joint press conference with the Pakistani premier. Rouhani said that among other things, they also discussed the Yemen war and the US sanctions on Iran. "Regional issues have to be resolved through regional means and dialogue. We also emphasized that any goodwill gesture will be reciprocated with a goodwill gesture and good words," said the Iranian president.

During his visit to the US last month, Khan said that President Donald Trump had asked him to "mediate" between its ally Saudi Arabia and Tehran. The US leader, however, refuted Khan's claim. Read more: Convincing Trump on Kashmir — Pakistani PM Khan's toughest diplomatic test Nonetheless, Islamabad is stepping up efforts to defuse tensions between the Gulf neighbors as it fears that a possible US-backed war with Iran would spill over into Pakistan, unleashing sectarian violence between the country's majority Sunni and minority Shiite populations and devastating its already frail economy due to a potential oil crisis.

"Pakistan is willing to play its role towards strengthening peace and stability in the region." Militant activities For years, ties between Iran and Pakistan have remained tense due to a deep mutual mistrust. Pakistan has generally tried to maintain close ties with both Saudi Arabia and Iran — bitter regional foes — but has drifted away from Tehran in the past few years. Both Islamabad and Tehran accuse each other of backing separatist groups, which are active in Pakistan's and Iran's Baluchistan provinces and seek independence from both countries. In March, President Rouhani demanded Pakistan act decisively against anti-Iranian terrorists, following a February attack that killed 27 members of the elite Revolutionary Guard in Sistan-Baluchistan. Iran claimed that a Pakistani suicide bomber was behind the attack, which was claimed by the Sunni jihadi group Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice), which Tehran says operates mostly out of Pakistan. Read more: Why did US declare an anti-Iran militant group terrorist? Shiite-majority Iran is wary of Islamabad's alleged support for various Sunni militant groups, which have been involved in launching attacks in Iran's eastern areas, and massacring Shiite citizens inside Pakistan. The sectarian strife in Pakistan has been ongoing for some time now, with militant Islamist groups unleashing terror on the minority Shiite groups in many parts of the country. Most of these outfits, including the Taliban, take inspiration from the hard-line Saudi-Wahabi Islamic ideology. 'Solidly allied with Riyadh' Iran is also angered by Pakistan's role in the Saudi-led military alliance that is operating against Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen. Read more: Pakistan's Yemen dilemma: Being neutral is not an option "It is obvious that the Pakistani-Iranian ties have not been cordial for quite some time.

Read more: Examining Saudi-Pakistani ties in changing geopolitics Islamabad's over-enthusiasm to please Riyadh could further exacerbate its relations with Tehran. Security analysts say that Pakistan's support for Saudi Arabia has increased the Sunni-Shiite rift in the South Asian country. They also say that Sunni militant groups feel further emboldened by the fact that Raheel Sharif, Pakistan's ex-army chief, now heads the Saudi-led military alliance. Tehran is aware of Islamabad's cooperation with Riyadh. At the same time, it is aware of the concerns and limitations of its ties with Pakistan and wants to maintain "normal" relations with the neighboring country. "Pakistan remains solidly allied with Saudi Arabia, regardless of how intense the outreach may be from Tehran. There are decades of close military cooperation that are not about to be undone," said Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars. It remains to be seen whether Pakistani leader Khan can convince Iranian authorities that his country would not undermine Tehran's interests in the region. But experts say that since Pakistan is already part of the Saudi security alliance and has not done enough to allay Iran's concerns about its alleged role in backing anti-Iran militants on its soil, Khan's diplomatic efforts in Tehran are unlikely to yield results.

News article:
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani walks with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan as they attend a press conference in Tehran. PHOTO: REUTERS TEHRAN: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday reiterated that Pakistan was ready to act as a facilitator between the two brotherly Muslims countries - Iran and Saudi Arabia - to sort out their differences through dialogue. Addressing a joint press stakeout along with Iranian President Hassan Rowhani, the prime minister said, "In the past, Pakistan hosted Saudi Arabia and Iran and is again willing to facilitate the brotherly countries to iron out their differences." Prime Minister Imran along with his delegation had arrived on a day-long visit. The prime minister said, "The issue is a complex one but it is possible to sort out differences through dialogue." The prime minister also explained that his trip to Iran would be followed with a visit to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday which was sole "Pakistan's initiative" as they were not asked by anyone to undertake such a trip. He made it clear that Pakistan's role would be of a facilitator and not a mediator, stressing that it was imperative for everyone not to allow any conflict to take place in the region as he viewed certain vested interests which wanted to flare up tensions in the region. Terming his consultations with the Iranian president as very encouraging, the prime minister said he would go to Saudi Arabia with a positive mind. He said Pakistan had deep-rooted bilateral brotherly ties with Iran and Saudi Arabia was Pakistan's closest friend as it had always helped them when they were in need. For these reasons, he said, nobody wanted a conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The issue was recognised as a complex one, but he felt that it could be resolved through dialogue. The prime minister said a conflict between the two countries would not just affect the whole region but also affect the developing countries as it would increase poverty in the world as the cost of oil would shoot up and the purchase of expensive oil could lead to further spending. He said all the developing countries had the same point of view, only the vested interests wanted this conflict to take place. The prime minister said that during his visit to New York, US President Donald Trump spoke to him and asked him to facilitate dialogue with Iran. Expressing his resolve, the prime minister assured the Iranian leadership that they would do whatever they could to facilitate US-Iran dialogue so that the sanctions could be lifted and agreement over the nuclear deal be signed. Imran said the main reason for his visit to Iran was to avert any conflict in this region. Pakistan had suffered from 70,000 casualties in the war on terror, while Afghanistan and Syria were still reeling from the conflicts. "They do not want another conflict in this region," he said. The prime minister also thanked the government of Iran for supporting people of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. About eight million people in IOJ&K had been put under unrelenting curfew for more than two months. "It is the biggest humanitarian crisis unfolding in the region," he added. The prime minister said it was his third meeting with the Iranian president, first in April, second in New York and third but brief one at Bishkek. About his meeting in Tehran, the prime minister said he discussed bilateral ties, trade, and host of other issues of mutual interests and the ways to help each other. He noted that Pakistan enjoyed strong ties with Iran and they still remembered how Iran stood with Pakistan in 1965 while facing hostilities. President Rowhani said Iran and Pakistan were brotherly and friendly nations enjoying deep strategic relations. The president said they openly welcomed the goodwill gesture by Pakistan and ready to assist it in its efforts for peace and stability in the region. Appreciating the prime minister's initiative, he said his visit would have benefits, adding they discussed a variety of issues significant for the region and the whole globe. He said they had discussed the recent developments in the Gulf and emphasised on the strengthening of peace and stability in the region. "We also emphasised that the goodwill gesture would be responded to with goodwill gesture and words," he added. Rowhani noted that emphasis on termination of the war in Yemen and humanitarian aid to the people of Yemen would bring peace and stability in the region, adding that the issue could be resolved through political dialogue. The Iranian president also decried the pressing sanctions of the US and demanded the US to return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, so that it could be implemented. He also demanded the immediate lifting of the US sanctions. In May last year, President Trump had announced the US' withdrawal from the JCPOA followed by the imposition of sanctions.

The Iranian president also decried the pressing sanctions of the US and demanded the US to return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, so that it could be implemented. He also demanded the immediate lifting of the US sanctions. In May last year, President Trump had announced the US' withdrawal from the JCPOA followed by the imposition of sanctions.

Foreign minister says Pakistan's main purpose of diplomatic initiative was to prevent any escalation in tensions. SCREENGRAB ISLAMABAD: [fbvideo link=" https://www.facebook.com/etribune/videos/445374942997484/"][/fbvideo] The threat of an immediate conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran has been averted thanks to Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi announced on Wednesday. Qureshi told the media that both the Saudi and Iranian leadership had agreed to pursue diplomatic options to resolve their differences. His statement came just hours after Prime Minister Imran Khan concluded a visit to Saudi Arabia as part of Pakistan’s efforts to defuse tensions in the Persian Gulf region. The prime minister had earlier travelled to Tehran, where he said Pakistan wanted to facilitate dialogue between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Qureshi said the Iranian leadership shared Pakistan’s perspective and expressed their willingness to hold direct talks or through any third party with Saudi Arabia. The Iranian leadership also said they never wanted war with Saudi Arabia. Prime Minister Imran, according to Qureshi, took the same message to Saudi Arabia. In Riyadh, Imran, who was also accompanied by ISI DG Lt General Faiz Hameed and other senior officials, met Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. “Pakistan’s main objective was to avert any conflict between the two countries, Qureshi said, adding that he could say with confidence that the “threat of an immediate conflict” between Saudi Arabia and Iran was now fading away. The two countries, he went on to say, agreed to pursue diplomatic options to resolve their differences. The mode of dialogue was being finalised, he added. According to officials familiar with the development, Pakistan suggested direct talks between the Saudi and Iranian authorities. The prime minister even proposed Islamabad as the venue for such talks, the officials added. The ISI DG, who in the last week of September quietly visited Iran and Saudi Arabia, is believed to have played a major role in laying the ground for de-escalation in the Middle East. Officials said he would be the focal person for future contacts between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Qureshi explained that the reason behind prime minister’s diplomatic initiative was the negative fallout of any conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia on Pakistan. He said war in the Middle East would not only jeopardise the regional security but also have devastating consequences for the world’s economy. “We have seen how the oil prices in the international market shot up after missile attacks on the Saudi oil facilities,” Qureshi recalled. “Just imagine the consequences of a war between major oil producing countries,” the foreign minister asked. Tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran have been on the rise since September 14 missile attacks on the Saudi oil facilities. Both Riyadh and Washington blamed Tehran, which strongly denied its involvement. Houthi rebels in Yemen on the other hand took responsibility. Before visiting Riyadh, Prime Minister Imran told CNN in an interview that President Trump had asked him to mediate between Saudi Arabia and Iran. On Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif acknowledged the Prime Minister’s peace efforts.

News article:
Pakistan: Threat of Saudi-Iran War Subsiding Due to Diplomacy by Islamabad By Ayaz Gul October 16, 2019 Pakistan said Wednesday that Saudi Arabia and Iran have both shown a willingness to settle mutual disputes through diplomacy and negotiations, reducing chances of an immediate war in the Gulf. The development stemmed from Islamabad's diplomatic initiative aiming to defuse Tehran's escalating tensions with Riyadh and "facilitate" possible talks between the two rivals, Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told reporters. He was speaking after making trips with Prime Minister Imran Khan this week to the Iranian and Saudi capitals, where they discussed with leaders of the two countries how they both can overcome increased "misunderstandings" following last month's devastating strikes against vital Saudi oil-producing installations. "If I were to present to you the crux of our discussions, I would say the dark clouds of war and conflict now look to be slowly dispersing. And this was Pakistan's objective No. 1: to prevent another conflict from hitting us [the region]," Qureshi asserted. Riyadh and the United States have blamed Iran for orchestrating the attack – charges the Iranians deny. Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen, which are fighting a Riyadh-led military coalition, took responsibility for the Sept. 14 attacks. Khan traveled to Tehran on Sunday for his daylong "wide-ranging consultations" with President Hassan Rouhani. Speaking to reporters alongside Khan after the meeting, the Iranian leader hailed the Pakistani initiative and promised to reciprocate positively to "any goodwill gesture" to promote regional peace. Qureshi said the Pakistani prime minister during his one-day trip to Riyadh on Tuesday conveyed "Iran's sentiments" to the Saudi leadership and it was agreed to in those meetings that a "peaceful diplomatic process" would be given a chance to ease tensions. "I found them responsive to give peace a chance. I found them responsive for engagement," Qureshi added when asked whether Iranian and Saudi leaders were ready for direct talks. The foreign minister noted a "mechanism for a way forward" is also currently under discussion. "It's a good beginning, but it would not be appropriate for me to divulge further details," he said. Qureshi also hinted at a possible cease-fire in Yemen, but he gave no further details. Iran has long demanded that Saudi Arabia halt its military operations against Houthi insurgents in Yemen. Pakistan has traditionally close political, economic and defense ties with Saudi Arabia. Pakistani troops also are stationed on Saudi soil to train local forces. More than 2.5 million Pakistanis are living and working in the kingdom. But with its large Shi'ite minority and a nearly 900-kilometer (560 mile) border with Iran, Islamabad has largely stayed neutral in Middle East tensions. It declined a Saudi call a few years back to join the military alliance fighting the Houthi insurgents in Yemen, winning praise from Iran. US-Iran ties Khan has said U.S. President Donald Trump also asked him to mediate U.S. tensions with Iran, when the two leaders met in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, "I did speak to to President Rouhani, when I was in Iran [on Sunday] about the U.S. offer. And that's an evolving situation, so let's see if it gets anywhere," Khan told CNN at his office on Tuesday just before traveling to Saudi Arabia. The prime minister, however, described the situation between the U.S. and Iran as "more complicated" and declined to discuss further details about his mediatory efforts on that front "until there is some response from both sides." Khan said he was optimistic about his diplomatic initiative and noted he indicated support to Trump for his policy of winding down America's wars. "What I like about him, he does not believe in wars." The Pakistani leader says his country is suffering from years of war in neighboring Afghanistan and can barely afford another regional conflict. Washington also acknowledges Khan's efforts to facilitate now defunct U.S.-Taliban peace talks aimed at ending the Afghan war, America's longest overseas military intervention.

Pakistan: Threat of Saudi-Iran War Subsiding Due to Diplomacy by Islamabad By Ayaz Gul October 16, 2019 Pakistan said Wednesday that Saudi Arabia and Iran have both shown a willingness to settle mutual disputes through diplomacy and negotiations, reducing chances of an immediate war in the Gulf. The development stemmed from Islamabad's diplomatic initiative aiming to defuse Tehran's escalating tensions with Riyadh and "facilitate" possible talks between the two rivals, Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told reporters. He was speaking after making trips with Prime Minister Imran Khan this week to the Iranian and Saudi capitals, where they discussed with leaders of the two countries how they both can overcome increased "misunderstandings" following last month's devastating strikes against vital Saudi oil-producing installations. "If I were to present to you the crux of our discussions, I would say the dark clouds of war and conflict now look to be slowly dispersing. And this was Pakistan's objective No. 1: to prevent another conflict from hitting us [the region]," Qureshi asserted. Riyadh and the United States have blamed Iran for orchestrating the attack – charges the Iranians deny. Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen, which are fighting a Riyadh-led military coalition, took responsibility for the Sept. 14 attacks. Khan traveled to Tehran on Sunday for his daylong "wide-ranging consultations" with President Hassan Rouhani. Speaking to reporters alongside Khan after the meeting, the Iranian leader hailed the Pakistani initiative and promised to reciprocate positively to "any goodwill gesture" to promote regional peace. Qureshi said the Pakistani prime minister during his one-day trip to Riyadh on Tuesday conveyed "Iran's sentiments" to the Saudi leadership and it was agreed to in those meetings that a "peaceful diplomatic process" would be given a chance to ease tensions. "I found them responsive to give peace a chance. I found them responsive for engagement," Qureshi added when asked whether Iranian and Saudi leaders were ready for direct talks. The foreign minister noted a "mechanism for a way forward" is also currently under discussion. "It's a good beginning, but it would not be appropriate for me to divulge further details," he said. Qureshi also hinted at a possible cease-fire in Yemen, but he gave no further details. Iran has long demanded that Saudi Arabia halt its military operations against Houthi insurgents in Yemen. Pakistan has traditionally close political, economic and defense ties with Saudi Arabia. Pakistani troops also are stationed on Saudi soil to train local forces. More than 2.5 million Pakistanis are living and working in the kingdom. But with its large Shi'ite minority and a nearly 900-kilometer (560 mile) border with Iran, Islamabad has largely stayed neutral in Middle East tensions. It declined a Saudi call a few years back to join the military alliance fighting the Houthi insurgents in Yemen, winning praise from Iran. US-Iran ties Khan has said U.S. President Donald Trump also asked him to mediate U.S. tensions with Iran, when the two leaders met in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, "I did speak to to President Rouhani, when I was in Iran [on Sunday] about the U.S. offer. And that's an evolving situation, so let's see if it gets anywhere," Khan told CNN at his office on Tuesday just before traveling to Saudi Arabia. The prime minister, however, described the situation between the U.S. and Iran as "more complicated" and declined to discuss further details about his mediatory efforts on that front "until there is some response from both sides." Khan said he was optimistic about his diplomatic initiative and noted he indicated support to Trump for his policy of winding down America's wars. "What I like about him, he does not believe in wars." The Pakistani leader says his country is suffering from years of war in neighboring Afghanistan and can barely afford another regional conflict. Washington also acknowledges Khan's efforts to facilitate now defunct U.S.-Taliban peace talks aimed at ending the Afghan war, America's longest overseas military intervention.

News article:
Pakistan has become a key player in settling growing tensions in the region after US President Donald Trump made a request to Prime Minister Imran Khan on the sidelines of the recently concluded UN General Assembly to talk to Iran and Saudi Arabia. The two countries have traditionally had a tense relationship but this has grown worse a few months oil installations at Aramco were attacked by Houthi rebels, which Saudi Arabia says are backed by Iran. Iran has not openly acknowledged any support to the Houthis. Indeed, since the war in Yemen began in 2915 relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have been becoming increasingly strained. In the past, Pakistan’s efforts to act as mediator have not been particularly successful with former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif failing to bring about improvement after meeting with the Saudi leadership in 2016. PM Imran Khan has met Saudi Crown Prince Prince Muhammad bin Salman in Riyadh to discuss the situation and suggest all countries work towards peace. Prince Muhammad’s response is not known. Previously, Imran Khan, keeping his promise to President Trump met Iranian President Rouhani in Tehran and also put forward proposals for peace. Iran had agreed it sought peace in the region. One of the issues is the worsening relationship between the US and Iran after President Trump withdrew from an agreement on Iran’s nuclear weapons. There has also been a deployment of US troops in the waters close to Iran. While Islamabad’s ties with Riyadh and Tehran are both good, it may not be so easy to bring an end to hostilities between them given the animosity that exists and which is based on many factors including sectarian politics. For its own sake Pakistan will however be very eager to reduce temperatures in the region since any conflict in the Gulf would also affect it very badly. Pakistan shares a long border with Iran while Saudi Arabia is one of closest allies. For these reasons it is certain that the prime minister and his advisers on foreign relations would wish to achieve some kind of settlement. This would also earn them points with Washington given that President Trump had assigned them with a difficult task of acting as mediator. We hope for everyone’s sake that peace does prevail in the end.

News article:
Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi is crediting Pakistan for averting war in the Middle East, which would be a positive development if either of the two main parties to the conflict had offered any hint that this was the case. Qureshi said Saudi and Iranian leaders indicated a willingness to talk after meeting with Prime Minister Imran Khan this week, but given the massive implications of his statement, Qureshi offered no additional details to back up his claim.PM Imran’s visits can, however, still be seen as an effort at reconciliation that he could not have undertaken without a green light from the leaders of both countries. Incidentally, Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel-Mahdi has also been reportedly relaying messages about de-escalation between Saudi and Iranian leaders. The biggest sign that there has been a rapprochement actually came last week after the attack on an Iranian oil tanker, when Tehran refrained from instantly casting blame on the Saudis, as had been a common past practice. How long that restraint holds may well reflect on the level of commitment to peace on the Iranian side. The Saudis, meanwhile, have likely been forced to re-evaluate their own position after US President Donald Trump upturned the situation in Syria. By leaving America’s Kurdish allies high and dry, Trump may have shown the Saudis that he is not a reliable partner, even if he did send additional troops to the kingdom. Also worrying the Saudis would be his past reluctance to escalate any confrontation with Iran.In a recent interview, Imran may have strengthened this theory by telling CNN that Trump had asked him to “try and be a go-between with Iran and the United States.” In the same interview, Imran said a Saudi-Iran war would be “a disaster”. He also said that a priority in his discussions with the leaders of both countries was to create a ceasefire in Yemen, which is already a disaster because of the war between a Saudi-led coalition and Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. But let us be optimistic. Too many times, peacemaking efforts in the Middle East have been more talk and less action. Maybe Riyadh and Tehran’s silence is a good thing.Published in The Express Tribune, October 18, 2019.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.

News article:
ISLAMABAD: As Prime Minister Imran Khan has formally initiated efforts to broker patch-up between Iran and Saudi Arab, this is fourth attempt by any Pakistani leader to mediate between two Islamic countries. A couple of such efforts were made in past by former prime minister Mian Nawaz Sharif and one by the former military dictator Gen (R) Pervez Musharraf. Although Gen Ziaul Haq also had one mediation plan on his credit, it was during Iran-Iraq war and the efforts were aimed to end it. In September 1980, he went to Tehran on an “Islamic peace mission” to end the war, however, efforts failed to make any headway as neither side was ready to submit. Iran thought Iraq was aggressor and the vice versa. This war continued for eight years ending on August 20, 1988, three days after the death of Zia in a plane crash. Regarding Iran-Saudi Arab patch, the first such effort was made in March 1997 when Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) conference organised in Islamabad. Mian Nawaz Sharif was the prime minister. A meeting between Iranian president Hashmi Rafsanjani and Saudi crown prince Abdullah was arranged on the sidelines of this conference. Comparing with efforts made to-date, the first one taking place in 1997 was the most consequential as Rafsanjani visited Saudi Arab 11 months later. This was the first-ever visit by a top Iranian leader to Saudi Arab since Iranian revolution of 1979. It was 10-day long. Second attempt was made by Gen (R) Pervez Musharraf in February 2007 when he went to Tehran in a bid to bridge differences between the two Islamic countries, however, efforts didn’t yield result. He was engulfed in a serious crisis back at home when filed reference against Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry triggering country-wide protests. Musharraf tried to calm down domestic situation through yet another international engagement. In April that year, he offered to mediate between Israel and Palestine. Israeli politely turned down the offer saying there was “already positive ongoing dialogue between the Israel and Palestine.” Third initiative to resolve Iran-Saudi Arabia differences was taken by Mian Nawaz Sharif in 2016 when he first visited Saudi Arabia and then Iran in the company of Gen Raheel Sharif. Initial response was very good. A press release issued then said that the leadership of both countries had responded positively to this gesture. Nawaz Sharif said he considered this a sacred mission to help ending the differences between the two and that he was proud to play the role of a mediator. Pakistan then decided to appoint a focal person for the purpose and that Iran and Saudi Arabia would also be requested to do the same. From then onward, no development was reported on this front until this recent initiative. Analysts view the latest attempt different from the past in a sense that it has been started on the request of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, though it remains unclear who first said: either US President Donald Trump or Mohammad bin Salman. Speaking to media in New York during United Nations General Assembly session, both of them had asked him for mediation. “Trump asked me if we could de-escalate the situation and may be come up with another deal. I immediately spoke to President Rouhani yesterday after the meeting with President Trump. I can’t say right now more than this but this is what we are trying and mediating,” Imran told media persons. Crown Prince “also asked me to talk to the Iranian president,” he said on September 25. However, two days later, Trump told AFP that it was Imran Khan who had approached him to suggest this, not him. “He actually asked me. He thought it would be a good idea to meet,” Trump reportedly said. On Sunday last, during his visit to Tehran, Imran Khan said: “This visit to Iran and the visit that I’ll undertake to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday is a Pakistan-led initiative.

Source: Xinhua| 2019-10-08 21:39:21|Editor: xuxin Video Player Close by Marwa Yahya CAIRO, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has called for "international mediation" after its talks with Sudan and Ethiopia over Ethiopia's construction of a huge dam on the Nile river reached "a deadlock." The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) project has sparked Egypt's worry over Ethiopia's development needs, as well as concerns over its possible adverse effects on Egypt, including water scarcity and climate change. "Talks have reached a deadlock as a result of the Ethiopian side's inflexibility," Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation said in a statement on Saturday following the two-day ministerial negotiations held in Sudan's capital Khartoum. It said that Ethiopia presented a new proposal during the Khartoum talks, which was a "step back from all the principles previously agreed upon for the filling and operation of the dam." The proposal did not include the minimum annual drainage of the dam, or ways to deal with the cases of drought that might occur in the future, the statement added. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi tweeted later that Egypt would "continue to take necessary measures at the political level and in accordance with international law to protect its rights" in Nile waters. Meanwhile, Ethiopia denied on Sunday that the trilateral negotiations on the GERD ended in a stalemate. "Ethiopia stands ready to resolve any difference and outstanding concerns by consultation among the three countries," Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed tweeted. He added the government of Ethiopia will reinforce its efforts to make the ongoing trilateral dialogue a success and expects a similar commitment from the two downstream countries, Egypt and Sudan. During the negotiations, the three countries stressed the rights of the 11 basin countries of the Nile to utilize Nile waters based on principles of equitable utilization and avoiding significant harm. Tariq Fahmy, professor of the international relations in Cairo University, told Xinhua that Egypt should seek "international mediation" to resolve the dispute. He named two scenarios that could be adopted by the Egyptian side: seeking the African Union's support, and then refer the whole issue to the United Nations. He said that finding a fourth country for mediation between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia will be a second option, noting that international arbitration could not work without the approval of Ethiopia. The military action could be the last option on the table, Fahmy added. Egyptian Presidency's spokesman Bassam Radi said on Saturday that Egypt was looking forward to an "instrumental role" by the United States in the talks. He said that, as no breakthrough was achieved in the negotiations, there was a need for an "international instrumental role to overcome the current deadlock." The GERD, announced in 2011, is designed to promote Ethiopia's bid to become the continent's biggest power exporter, generating more than 6,000 megawatts. According to the World Bank, 66 percent of Ethiopia's population live without electricity, the third highest proportion in the world. But Egypt fears that Ethiopia is moving too fast to complete the dam and will create water and food scarcity to force millions of Egypt's farmers out of work. Egypt relies on the Nile river for 90 percent of its need of fresh water. "When the dam starts operating, it depends on how quickly its main reservoir can be filled from Nile water and this is the heart of the dispute," said Ahmad Abdel Monem, expert in water resources with the Middle East Studies Center. Ethiopia wants the reservoir to be filled in three to five years, with 35 billion cubic meters of water being released to downstream countries each year while the dam is being filled. Egypt called for the reservoir to be filled more slowly, over seven years, citing that its water supplies will be reduced during this period. Under the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement between Egypt and Sudan, Egypt takes 55.5 billion cubic meters of water from the Nile each year. Monem said Egypt will resort to legitimate methods in protecting its rights, especially international mediation, which should be done before Ethiopia proceeds with the filling process to avoid any disputes.

Madbouly accused Ethiopia of adopting radical positions in the latest round of negotiations on the Renaissance Dam, indicating that Egypt is moving to seek arbitration to reach agreement Egypt’s Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly has accused Ethiopia of backtracking on all previous agreements related to the Nile water. In a statement delivered before parliament on Wednesday, Madbouly said that Ethiopia took a unilateral decision in 2011 to build its Grand Ethiopia Renaissance Dam (GERD). "This unilateral decision was in violation of international agreements, and despite this fact we choose dialogue to reach agreement with Ethiopia," said Madbouly. Madbouly said that Ethiopia displayed very radical positions in the latest round of negotiations held in Khartoum and rejected all proposals submitted by Egypt to solve the differences. “Ethiopia’s radical positions represent a violation of the declaration of principles reached by the presidents of Egypt, Sudan and the prime minister of Ethiopia in Khartoum on 23 March 2015,” said Madbouly. The prime minister added that “it is quite clear that Ethiopia wants to impose the status quo on Egypt, and so we find that it has become very difficult to reach agreements with Ethiopia and negotiations have reached a deadlock.” Madbouly indicated that Egypt is moving to implement Article 10 of the declaration of principles, which allows any of the three countries to seek a mediator that can resolve differences in a scientific way. Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said that Egypt is proposing that the World Bank act as a mediator in this respect. Shoukry said that Egypt will never allow Ethiopia to impose the status quo and that Egypt has the power not only to protect its rights to the Nile water but also to resort to international law in this respect. Shoukry said that upon instructions from President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, all state authorities have moved to intensify communications with all concerned international organisations in order to overcome all obstacles. Madbouly said that irrespective of the GERD problem, Egypt has begun setting up a large number of desalination plants and rationalising the use of water. “We want to assure every Egyptian that the government is implementing a number of giant water projects until 2037,” said Madbouly. Parliament speaker Ali Abdel-Aal urged Ethiopia to exercise wisdom and to show respect for Egypt’s rights. “I want to tell MPs not to jump to hasty conclusions, we still have a lot of diplomatic and peaceful channels, but in the end, there is a red line that none should cross, and Egypt will never allow the loss of any drop of Nile water,” said Abdel-Aal.

A massive dam under construction on the Nile River has sparked fresh tensions between Ethiopia and Egypt as both sides accused each other in a growing diplomatic row. Earlier this week, Ethiopia accused Egypt of trying to maintain its grip over the waters of the Nile and rejected Cairo's conditions for filling a reservoir. In return, Egypt accused Ethiopia of violating the Declaration of Principles, saying that it "will have negative consequences for stability in the region." Last week, Egypt said the talks were deadlocked, accusing Ethiopia of "inflexibility" and calling for international mediation. Ethiopia rejected that call. Trilateral talks between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia have been deadlocked for more than a year before restarting in Cairo earlier in the day.Egypt fears the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) will cut into its share of the river, which provides virtually all the fresh water for the arid country of 100 million people. Ethiopia, which has the same sized population, says the dam is essential for its economic development. The dam project, launched by Ethiopia in 2012, is designed to feed a hydroelectric project to produce 6,000 megawatts of power, equal to six nuclear power plants. The construction of GERD, the largest hydroelectric dam project in Africa, has poisoned relations between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan. The dispute centers on the right to control a section of the Nile that stretches 6,695 kilometers from Lake Victoria to the Mediterranean and is the economic lifeblood of all three countries.

News article:
Amid a long-running diplomatic standoff over building and operating the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam that has heightened tensions, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said Sunday he would meet Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in Russia. He did not say, however, when they would meet, but Russia will host the first Russian-African summit in the Black sea resort of Sochi on Oct. 23 and Oct. 24. While Egypt wants to guarantee a steady supply of water for its 100 million citizens, Ethiopia is determined to power the homes of over 100 million citizens. Being a downstream country on the Blue Nile, Sudan shares Egypt's water supply concerns, while, at the same time, it needs the power that will be generated by Ethiopia’s dam. Trilateral talks between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia have been deadlocked for more than a year. In May last year, the three countries reached an agreement to set up a scientific study group to consult on the filling of the dam. But no progress has been reported since. The dam is now more than 60% finished, and Ethiopia hopes to become a key energy hub in Africa upon its completion. The dam will generate about 6,400 megawatts (MW), more than doubling Ethiopia's current production of 4,000 MW. The dam project, launched by Ethiopia in 2012, is designed to feed a hydroelectric project to produce 6,000 MW of power, equal to six nuclear-powered plants. The construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam or the GERD, the largest hydroelectric dam project in Africa, has poisoned relations between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan. The dispute centers on the right to control a section of the Nile that stretches 6,695 kilometers from Lake Victoria to the Mediterranean and is the economic lifeblood of all three countries.

News article:
Cairo will this week push Addis Ababa to agree to an outside mediator to help resolve a deepening dispute over a giant hydropower dam being built on Ethiopia’s Blue Nile, officials said on Sunday. ‮‮ ‬‬ Egypt fears the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam will threaten scarce water supplies and power generation at its own dam in Aswan. It says it has exhausted efforts to reach an agreement on the conditions for operating the dam and filling the reservoir behind it, after years of talks with Ethiopia and Sudan. Ethiopia has denied that the talks are stalled, accusing Egypt of trying to sidestep the process. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi is expected to raise the demand for a mediator when he meets Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed during a summit in Russia this week. “We’re hoping this meeting might produce an agreement on the participation of a fourth party,” an Egyptian Foreign Ministry official said. “We’re hopeful to reach a formula in the next few weeks.” Egyptian officials said they had suggested the World Bank as a fourth party mediator, but were open to a country with technical experience on water-sharing, such as the US. The EU was another option. Proposals by Egypt for a flexible filling of the reservoir and a guaranteed annual flow of 40 billion cubic metres were rejected by Ethiopia. The latest rounds of talks in Cairo and Khartoum over the past two months ended in acrimony. “The gap is getting wider,” the Egyptian official said. Egypt draws almost all of its fresh water from the Nile, and is faced with worsening scarcity for its population of nearly 100 million. It says it is trying to reduce the amount of water used in agriculture. Hydrologists consider a country to be facing water scarcity if supplies drop below 1,000 cubic metres a person each year. Egypt has about 570 cubic metres a person a year, which is expected to drop to 500 by 2025, without taking into account any reduction in supply caused by the dam, officials said. Ethiopia is expected to start filling the reservoir next year.

News article:
The late Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the former Egyptian foreign minister and the first African to become the United Nations secretary general, once said a military confrontation over water was “nearly inevitable”. While we have yet to reach that critical point, water scarcity and the value of a much-needed resource have led to battle lines being drawn between nations. Increasingly, such disputes are becoming flashpoints that could tip into dangerous and volatile situations. Quote The Nile is a shared resource, one belonging to the world, not simply the 11 countries it traverses. It is imperative both sides are willing to reach a compromise The long-running row between Egypt and Ethiopia over who can lay claim to the 6,650-kilometre river Nile is a complex issue that stretches back years. The White Nile and the Blue Nile are the river's two main tributaries, converging in Khartoum before the river flows through Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. The dispute centres on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which Ethiopia began constructing on the Blue Nile in 2012, close to the border with Sudan. Ethiopia says the $4 billion hydroelectric dam will begin generating power by the end of 2020 and will be fully operational by 2022. Once completed, it is set to be the largest dam in Africa, generating about 6,000 megawatts of electricity for both domestic use and export. It is a project Ethiopia sees as essential to its transformation into a power hub and to ensure its food security. Egypt, meanwhile, says it is reliant on the Nile for 90 per cent of its irrigation and drinking water supplies and fears it will be catastrophically affected by the dam project. For years, the two countries have been wrangling for a resolution, with repeated talks – including with Sudan – failing to reach a solution. With construction of the dam continuing apace, negotiations have reached stalemate. In the most recent round of talks in Khartoum held earlier this month, ahead of both sides meeting in Sochi this week, the parties failed to break the deadlock. Since the dispute first erupted, there has been a change in leadership, with Abiy Ahmed becoming Ethiopia’s prime minister last year and winning the Nobel Peace Prize this year. Yet despite settling his differences with his neighbour Eritrea, a peace pact with Egypt still eludes him. For Egypt, the implications of the dam pose problems of water and food scarcity that already plague the country’s population of more than 100 million. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi has cited “historic rights” to the river, guaranteed by decades-old treaties. He does, however, acknowledge the importance of the dam for Ethiopia but rightly, he wants assurances that Egypt’s millions are not going to face water or power shortages. In the face of rising food prices in the country, Egypt’s concerns about its agricultural yield being adversely affected by reduced irrigation supplies are valid. So too is Ethiopia’s need to protect against drought. But the Nile is a shared resource, one belonging to the world, not simply the 11 countries it traverses. It is imperative both sides are willing to reach a compromise that fulfils the most critical needs of their populations. When Mr Sisi meets Mr Abiy in Sochi this week at the first Russian-African summit, there will be the opportunity for international partners and allies to play the role of mediator as the two sides search for a satisfactory solution. Mr Sisi is expected to push for an external negotiator such as the US or EU, which could bring their experiences on water-sharing agreements and arbitrating tricky deals to the table. The White House has responded offering support and urged all sides "to put forth good-faith efforts to reach an agreement". To secure the future of the Nile Basin and prevent food and water scarcity reaching a critical point, Ethiopia and Egypt must prioritise sustainability and a fair deal for both in their allocation of a shared resource. Accidents of geography cannot be used for political gain. With the peace and stability of the region at stake, the outcome of an escalation in the dispute could be potentially catastrophic.

Ethiopia’s prime minister warned on Tuesday that his country is ready mobilise "millions" if it comes to war over the construction of the Grand Rennaisance Ethiopian Dam (GERD) Addis Ababa is building on the Blue Nile, though he stressed that settling the dispute through negotiations is in everyone's best interest. “Some say things about use of force [by Egypt]. It should be underlined that no force could stop Ethiopia from building a dam,” AP quoted Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed as saying. “If there is a need to go to war, we could get millions readied. If some could fire a missile, others could use bombs. But that’s not in the best interest of all of us.” Tensions have been building up between Egypt and Ethiopia in recent weeks after talks on the technical details governing the operation of the $4 billion mega-dam failed to make progress. Aiby, who won the Nobel Peace Prize earlier this month for his peacemaking efforts with Eritrea and major political reforms at home, made the remarks during a parliament enquiry session. He was answering questions from lawmakers about a number of major issues including the GERD, which Addis Ababa hopes will turn Ethiopia into a regional power hub. Egypt fears that the speed of the filling of the dam will diminish its water supply, which is crucially dependent on the Nile. But Ethiopia maintains that the 6,000 megawatts hydroelectric dam, which is nearly 70 percent complete, will not restrict the river’s flow. Some media figures in Egypt had said that resolving the dam issue, which officials describe as a matter of national security, could require military action. Abiy stressed that his country is determined to complete the dam project “because it’s an excellent one.” The Ethiopian leader is expected to meet with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi on Thursday on the sidelines of a Russia-Africa summit in the Russian city of Sochi on October 23 and 24. Earlier this month, the Egyptian presidency said the two leaders agreed in a phone call to overcome any obstacles facing negotiations on the operation of the dam. The call came after El-Sisi had congratulated Abiy on Facebook for winning the Nobel Prize. Egyptian officials had earlier said that talks over the matter had reached a deadlock and called for international mediation. Ethiopia has dismissed the calls for mediation, saying it has faith in the trilateral negotiations, which also involve Sudan. Search Keywords: Short link:

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia will face problems if it delays its general election beyond the scheduled date of May next year, the prime minister said on Tuesday, recalling past political violence. Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed speaks during a session with the Members of the Parliament in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, October 22, 2019. REUTERS/Tiksa Negeri “Democracy needs exercise. If we say we cannot hold elections now, it will bring a lot of problems. We should work wholeheartedly by building public trust,” Abiy Ahmed, this year’s Nobel peace prize winner, told parliament. The electoral board has the financing and capacity to conduct the polls in the country of 105 million. The vote would be the first under Abiy, who took office in April 2018 and began introducing political and economic reforms. These reforms have opened up what was once one of Africa’s most repressive nations but also stoked violence as emboldened regional strongmen build ethnic powerbases and compete over political influence and resources. Ethiopia has regularly held elections since 1995, but with the exception of the 2005 election, no election has been competitive. In the 2005 poll, riots erupted after the opposition cried foul, security forces killed nearly 200 protesters, and the government jailed many opposition politicians. “The people of Ethiopia have taken lessons from the conflict that happened following the 2005 general elections. Ethiopians do not want conflicts arising in connection with elections,” Abiy said. Questioned by MPs about the future of the fractious ruling coalition - some form of which has been in power since 1991 - Abiy said he intends to merge the coalition into a single party. One of the coalition’s four ethnic-based parties, the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), rejected the idea last week. The TPLF was the most powerful force in the coalition until Abiy came to power. Rapidly transforming the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front “may create more instability and that would exacerbate an already difficult environment for conducting a free and fair election”, said William Davison, an Ethiopia analyst at the International Crisis Group think-tank. Asked about a dispute with Egypt over the giant hydropower dam being built on Ethiopia’s Blue Nile, Abiy said: “No force will stop Ethiopia from building the dam.” Abiy, who won the Nobel this month for his peacemaking efforts with longtime enemy Eritrea, raised the prospect of war over the dam: “If we are going to war ... we can deploy many millions. But war is not a solution.” Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is expected to raise the demand for a mediator over the dam when he meets Abiy during a Russia-Africa summit this week.

Rapidly transforming the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front “may create more instability and that would exacerbate an already difficult environment for conducting a free and fair election”, said William Davison, an Ethiopia analyst at the International Crisis Group think-tank. Asked about a dispute with Egypt over the giant hydropower dam being built on Ethiopia’s Blue Nile, Abiy said: “No force will stop Ethiopia from building the dam.” Abiy, who won the Nobel this month for his peacemaking efforts with longtime enemy Eritrea, raised the prospect of war over the dam: “If we are going to war ... we can deploy many millions. But war is not a solution.” Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is expected to raise the demand for a mediator over the dam when he meets Abiy during a Russia-Africa summit this week.

News article:
Egypt President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi is set to meet Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on the sidelines of the Russia-Africa Summit Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed are set to meet on the sidelines of the Russia-Africa Summit in Sochi in an attempt to revive stalled talks regarding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which Egypt is concerned will reduce the flow of Nile water to downstream countries. Egypt's foreign minister Sameh Soukry told Russian Sputnik news agency on Monday that Russia could help solve the Ethiopian Dam problem. "Russia is a big and permanent member of the Security Council. It is a state that always supports and emphasises the principles of international legitimacy and the need to respect international law," Shoukry told Sputnik in an interview in Cairo on the occasion of the Africa-Russia summit, which will be held in the Russian resort city of Sochi on 23-24 October. "The countries of the world can contribute to resolving this issue which affects 105 million Egyptians, 40 million Sudanese and 100 million Ethiopians," Shoukry said. President El-Sisi said on Monday that Egypt has exerted strenuous and balanced efforts to break the stalemate in the GERD talks. The president expressed hope that an agreement would be reached to guarantee the water supply for Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia, saying that the rivers flowing through the continent should be a source of brotherhood and prosperity, not a source of conflicts, presidential spokesman Bassam Rady said. On the other hand, Ethiopia’s prime minister warned on Tuesday that his country is ready mobilise "millions" if it comes to war over the construction of the GERD, though he stressed that settling the dispute through negotiations is in everyone's best interest. "The meeting is the last chance to revive the negotiations," Egypt's former minister of water resources and irrigation Mohamed Nasr El-Din Allam told Ahram Online. Allam said that Ethiopia must understand Egypt's demands and seize this opportunity instead of stalling. He also suggested that Ethiopia is rejecting the involvement of any third party in the negotiations because any external study would reveal that the dam would have a negative impact on downstream countries. Ethiopia has rejected a proposal by Egypt that the dam be filled over a period of seven years and release 40 billion cubic meters of water every year. Earlier this month, Egyptian officials said that talks over the matter had reached a deadlock and called for international mediation. Ethiopia has dismissed the calls for mediation, saying it has faith in the trilateral negotiations. "In my opinion, it is difficult to reach a solution without an international mediator; however, Ethiopia is expected to refuse any mediation," Allam said. Allam added that the setting of the upcoming meeting between El-Sisi and Ahmed presents an opportunity for Russia's involvement as a mediator, and that any mediation would reveal the fairness of Egypt's demands. The upcoming meeting is significant for both its timing and for the fact that it involves the leaders of Egypt and Ethiopia, according to Ayman Abdel-Wahab, deputy head of the Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies and an expert in African affairs. "This meeting represents an opportunity for talks removed from the technical discussions that Ethiopia has been stalling since 2017," Abdel-Wahab said. Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly has said that Egypt is forced to resort to Article 10 of the Declaration of Principles signed in Khartoum in 2015, which allows for an outside party to mediate in the negotiations. Earlier this week, Madbouly said that the dam is being built without regard to any environmental, economic or social studies. Madbouly added that although Egypt fully understands the need of Nile Basin countries for development, this should not come at the cost of harming other nations. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Ethiopia is planning to build a massive dam to supply their population with hydro-electric energy. The only problem is that the dam will block a key water source to the Nile River. And the Nile is Egypt’s main source of fresh water. This has caused pro-government journalists to call for war against Ethiopia similar to that of the 1973 Yom Kippur War against Israel – a war that Egypt lost. Talks between Cairo and Addis Ababa broke down earlier this month over Ethiopia’s nearly finished massive upstream dam. The project entitled the ‘Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam’ is about 70% finished reports TOI and is expected to supply it’s 100 million citizens with electricity. But Egypt, who has almost as big of a population is concerned that the process of filling the resevoir that sits behind the dam will come at the expense of the country’s main source of fresh water – the Nile. That’s because the project could drastically reduce the flow of the Blue Nile, the main tributary to the Nile. The tributary is fed by annual rainfall in Ethiopia’s highlands. “While we acknowledge Ethiopia’s right to development, the water of the Nile is a question of life, a matter of existence to Egypt,” Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sissi said. On the other hand, Ethiopian President Sahle-Work Zewude, said that her country believes “the use of the river should be (decided) according to international law and fair and equitable use of natural resources.” Ethiopia has been making efforts to resolve the issue of the Nile with countries like Ethiopia and Sudan who complain that Cairo enjoys more than their fair share of the world’s longest river. Egypt, to their credit, has south international mediation in an effort to resolve the matter and has reached out to countries such as the United States, Russia, and China. An Ethiopian official said the packages offered by Cairo so far “were deliberately prepared to be unacceptable for Ethiopia.” Meanwhile, Egyptian journalists are going as far as to call for a war against Ethiopia. Anwar el-Hawary, who used to be the editor of the Al-Masry Al-Youm new outlet, compared the dispute to the 1973 Yom Kippur War against Israel, in which Egypt waged a surprise attack into the Sinai Peninsula. “If we fought to liberate Sinai, it is logical to fight to liberate the water,” he posted on his Facebook account. “The danger is the same in the two cases.”

News article:
Egypt and Ethiopia's leaders agreed on Thursday to the immediate resumption of the work by a technical committee trying to agree on the operating terms of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), an Egyptian presidency spokesman said, Reuters reports. The work of the committee had failed to produce agreement over years of meetings, causing a diplomatic dispute between the two nations. The hydropower dam is currently under construction on Ethiopia's Blue Nile, and Ethiopia is expected to start filling the reservoir behind it next year. Egypt fears the dam could restrict already scarce supplies of water from the Nile, on which it is almost entirely dependent. Ethiopia says the dam is crucial to its economic development. In recent weeks, Egypt said three-way talks with Ethiopia and Sudan had been exhausted, issuing calls for an external mediator. Ethiopia PM: If there's a war with Egypt over the dam, millions would join Ethiopia denied that talks between the three countries were stalled, accusing Egypt of trying to sidestep the process. There was no mention of a mediator in the statement issued by a spokesman for Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi after he met Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on the sidelines of a African-Russian summit in Sochi. It said work of the technical committee would resume "in a more open and positive manner, in order to reach a final vision on the rules for filling and operating the dam". Pictures showed the two leaders smiling as they shook hands.

News article:
The leaders of Egypt and Ethiopia agreed on Thursday to immediately resurrect an independent technical committee tasked with formulating a plan to operate an upstream Nile dam, in what amounts to a partial breakthrough that could defuse growing tensions between the two nations. The dispute over the impact of Ethiopia's dam on Egypt’s vital share of the Nile water morphed this week into an ominous war of words after the East African nation’s Nobel Peace Prize-winning prime minister warned he could muster millions of people if conflict broke out with Egypt over the nearly completed structure on the Blue Nile. Addis Ababa’s saber-rattling and Cairo’s measured response came as the United States announced it was inviting the foreign ministers of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan to Washington for talks on the dispute. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday also offered to mediate between Egypt and Ethiopia, but it was not immediately clear if they accepted the offer. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed discussed the dam in a meeting on the sidelines of a Russia-Africa summit in the Black Sea city of Sochi. Egyptian presidential spokesman Bassam Radi said the two leaders wanted the technical committee to work “more openly and positively” toward reaching a “final and comprehensive” scenario for operating the dam and filling its massive reservoir. He said the two leaders also agreed to move past what he described as the “negative fallout” from comments made by Mr Abiy. “Some say things about use of force [by Egypt]. It should be underlined that no force could stop Ethiopia from building a dam,” the Ethiopian leader told parliament on Tuesday. “If there is a need to go to war, we could get millions readied. If some could fire a missile, others could use bombs. But that’s not in the best interest of all of us.” Egypt has refrained from any mention of military action to resolve the dispute, but some pro-government commentators have floated the notion that if Egypt does go into war against Ethiopia, it would be in self defence. The closest Egypt came to making a threat was a comment by Mr El Sisi while in New York last month. He said his country would not accept the imposition of a de-facto situation regarding the operation of the dam. Mr Abiy’s comments drew a sharp but measured response from Egypt, whose leader currently holds the rotating presidency of the African Union. The foreign ministry said Egypt was “shocked” by the “negative references” and “unacceptable suggestions”, saying it was “inappropriate to get into scenarios that include military options”. Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan have been involved in years of fruitless negotiations over operating the dam in a manner satisfactory to all three nations. The Blue Nile, which originates in the Ethiopian highlands, accounts for about 85 per cent of the Nile waters, but only about 65 per cent of the water reaching Egypt. The Blue Nile and the White Nile, which originates in central Africa, meet near Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, to become the Nile that flows through the deserts of northern Sudan and into Egypt all the way to the Mediterranean coast. Egypt depends on the Nile for more than 90 per cent of its water needs. It says it wants the reservoir behind the hydropower dam filled over seven years to minimise the impact on its vital share of the river’s water. It also wants Ethiopia to release 40 billion cubic metres every year and show flexibility during future spells of drought. With a population matching Egypt’s 100 million, Ethiopia views the dam as essential to its development. The structure has also become a symbol of national pride at a time when many Nile basin nations feel Egypt has unjustifiably enjoyed the lion’s share of the river’s water – an annual 55 billion cubic metres – for far too long. Cairo declared negotiations with Addis Ababa over the dam deadlocked and demanded that a foreign mediator be brought in. Ethiopia disagrees with that assessment and refuses to invite a third party, arguing that outstanding problems could still be resolved in talks. Ethiopia’s official media made no mention of the dam dispute in reports on Mr Abiy’s meeting with Mr El Sisi on Thursday, saying only that they discussed issues of mutual interest.

Source: Xinhua| 2019-10-29 06:23:29|Editor: Mu Xuequan Video Player Close CAIRO, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed on Monday the latest developments pertaining to the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). The GERD, which is built by Ethiopia on the Nile River, is causing spat between Cairo and Addis Ababa. In a statement, the Egyptian foreign ministry said the two top diplomats tackled the meeting the U.S. administration has called for in Washington, where the foreign ministers of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan, the three countries affected by the dam, are supposed to discuss the resumption of the technical negotiations on the filling and operation of the dam. "Pompeo expressed the U.S. administration's understanding of the importance of this issue and the need to reach a fair agreement that would achieve the interests of all three countries," the statement said. The last round of talks on the GERD held by Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia in the Sudanese capital Khartoum on Oct. 5 failed to reach a solution, with Egypt blaming Ethiopia for "rejecting all proposals that would help Egypt avoid serious harms caused by the construction of the dam." Egypt, a downstream Nile Basin country that relies on the Nile for its fresh water, is concerned that the construction of the GERD might affect its 55.5-billion-cubic-meter annual share of the river water. Ethiopia started building the dam in 2011, which is expected to produce more than 6,000 megawatts of electricity and become the largest hydropower dam in Africa upon completion. On Thursday, Egyptian presidency announced that Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed have agreed to immediately resume the work of the technical committee of the GERD. Both leaders met on the sidelines of the Russia-Africa Summit held in the Russian Black Sea resort city of Sochi last week. Meanwhile, the Egyptian foreign ministry said that Shoukry and Pompeo also addressed overall regional topics, including Syria and efforts to confront all forms of terrorism.

News article:
The Arab Parliament (AP) voiced on Thursday its full support for the legitimate demands of Egypt and Sudan to maintain their water security, legal and historic rights and shares of the River Nile water. In a resolution issued at the conclusion of the first session of the second legislative term, the parliament stressed that Egypt and Sudan’s water security is part and parcel of the Arab National security. The AP rejected affecting the two countries’ historic rights on the Nile water, reiterating that the agreements signed between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia on the Renaissance Dam should be implemented. The parliament asserted its full support for all measures taken by Egypt to reach a fair agreement on the dam in the manner that ensures the interests of all parties. Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan received an invitation, from the US for a meeting on 6 November to break the stalemate on the GERD. Tensions have been building up between Egypt and Ethiopia in recent weeks after talks on the technical details governing the operation of the mega-dam Addis Ababa is building on the Blue Nile failed to make progress. Egypt fears that the Ethiopian dam will diminish its water supply, which is dependent on the Nile, and is pushing for the dam's reservoir to be filled over seven years, while Addis Ababa insists on a three-year filling time. Ethiopia maintains that the dam, which is nearly 70 percent complete, will not restrict the river’s flow. Last week on the sideline of Russia-Africa Summit held in Russia, Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed decided that the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam's (GERD) independent technical committee should immediately resume its work in a more open and positive way.

Citing the historical ties between Egypt and Ethiopia, the Arab parliament urged Ethiopia to reach a deal on the issue of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). It expressed its solidarity with Egypt in protecting its water security and in maintaining its legal rights and fixed share of the Nile River. A draft on the GERD is under discussion at the Arab Parliament, the report said. Earlier, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told the Arab Parliament that Egypt is looking forward to signing a tripartite legal deal with Ethiopia and Sudan over the GERD issue in a meeting scheduled in Washington on Nov. 6. Shoukry demanded coordination of "the Arab and African efforts to promote the Ethiopian side to reach an agreement that guarantees the rights of all parties." The GERD is a dam on the Blue Nile River in Ethiopia, which has been under construction since 2011. Egypt, a downstream Nile Basin country that relies on the river for its fresh water, is concerned that the construction of the GERD might affect its 55.5-billion-cubic-meter annual share of the river water.

News article:
Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam (GERD) has been a bone of contention between Cairo and Addis Ababa since 2011 when construction began without consultations or environmental and impact studies. Egypt’s fears that the $4.8 billion (Dh17.6 billion) hydropower dam on Ethiopia’s Blue Nile, scheduled to be completed within two years, will negatively impact its country’s share of its lifeblood, upon which 90 per cent of its population rely in terms of drinking water and irrigation, are real and cannot be understated. Yet during eight years of negotiations involving Sudan, the Ethiopian government has shown utter disregard for Egypt’s concerns that GERD will potentially deprive the most populous Arab country of 60 billion cubic meters portended by technical studies. Such a dramatic shortfall coming at a time when Egypt’s per capita water resources have diminished by as much as 60 per cent since over the past 50 years is unacceptable. The current sticking point between the two nations is Ethiopia’s insistence of filling the reservoir within three years whereas Egypt stipulates a minimum of seven years. It is hard to understand why the Ethiopian government has adopted such an adversarial stand. What’s four short years between friends! Ironically just weeks after the Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last month when talks with Egypt had broken down, he boasted to parliamentarians that his country could mobilise many millions in the event of war over the dam - Linda S. Heard Ironically just weeks after the Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last month when talks with Egypt had broken down, he boasted to parliamentarians that his country could mobilise many millions in the event of war over the dam. “If some could fire missiles, others could use bombs,” he warned before adding that conflict was in nobody’s best interest. Egypt issued a statement expressing “deep shock and concern” over the PM’s remarks. Ahmed’s rhetoric was not only belligerent but also reckless when Egypt’s Nile water is an existential necessity and its military prowess has been beefed-up since 2013 now ranking 12th out of 137 countries as opposed to Ethiopia ranking 47th on Global Firepower’s index. Tensions flared to their highest ever until President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi and Prime Minister Ahmed met on the sidelines of the Russia-Africa Forum in Sochi for talks characterised as “positive”. Unconfirmed reports suggest Ahmed apologised for his unwarranted sabre-rattling.

Unless the authorities succeed in quelling ethno-religious fury, the PM’s reelection hopes for May 2020 are dim and no heroic theatricals against Egypt will preserve his vaulted chair. He bills himself as a reformer. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decorated him as a peacemaker. Never has the time been more propitious for Abiy Ahmed to live up to his stated ideals and those conferred upon him. In the meantime, Egypt prepares for all contingencies with the construction of 35 costly desalination plants around the country including the world’s largest in the town of Ain Sokhna on the shore of the Red Sea’s Gulf of Suez. But make no mistake, no amount of processed seawater can replace the fertile gift of silt delivered by the Nile that has nourished agricultural lands for millennia turning rain-starved deserts green.

News article:
Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam (GERD) has been a bone of contention between Cairo and Addis Ababa since 2011 when construction began without consultations or environmental and impact studies. Egypt’s fears that the $4.8 billion (Dh17.6 billion) hydropower dam on Ethiopia’s Blue Nile, scheduled to be completed within two years, will negatively impact its country’s share of its lifeblood, upon which 90 per cent of its population rely in terms of drinking water and irrigation, are real and cannot be understated. Yet during eight years of negotiations involving Sudan, the Ethiopian government has shown utter disregard for Egypt’s concerns that GERD will potentially deprive the most populous Arab country of 60 billion cubic meters portended by technical studies. Such a dramatic shortfall coming at a time when Egypt’s per capita water resources have diminished by as much as 60 per cent since over the past 50 years is unacceptable. The current sticking point between the two nations is Ethiopia’s insistence of filling the reservoir within three years whereas Egypt stipulates a minimum of seven years. It is hard to understand why the Ethiopian government has adopted such an adversarial stand. What’s four short years between friends! Ironically just weeks after the Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last month when talks with Egypt had broken down, he boasted to parliamentarians that his country could mobilise many millions in the event of war over the dam - Linda S. Heard Ironically just weeks after the Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last month when talks with Egypt had broken down, he boasted to parliamentarians that his country could mobilise many millions in the event of war over the dam. “If some could fire missiles, others could use bombs,” he warned before adding that conflict was in nobody’s best interest. Egypt issued a statement expressing “deep shock and concern” over the PM’s remarks. Ahmed’s rhetoric was not only belligerent but also reckless when Egypt’s Nile water is an existential necessity and its military prowess has been beefed-up since 2013 now ranking 12th out of 137 countries as opposed to Ethiopia ranking 47th on Global Firepower’s index. Tensions flared to their highest ever until President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi and Prime Minister Ahmed met on the sidelines of the Russia-Africa Forum in Sochi for talks characterised as “positive”. Unconfirmed reports suggest Ahmed apologised for his unwarranted sabre-rattling.

Egypt and Ethiopia will begin mediation talks in the US on Wednesday over the impact a Nile dam will have on Cairo’s share of Nile waters. The foreign ministers of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan are due to meet in Washington DC at the invitation of US President Donald Trump. The talks follow a deadlock in drawn-out negotiations, with Ethiopia rejecting Egyptian proposals to resolve the dispute and Sudan, which stands to benefit from the hydropower dam, quietly siding with Addis Ababa. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi spoke on the phone with President Trump late on Monday before he tweeted lavish praise of the US leader, describing him as a “a unique man who possesses the strength to face and deal with crises". He thanked Mr Trump for “efforts to sponsor the tripartite negotiations” and said he would like to emphasise his “full confidence in this generous sponsorship, which will find an agreement that safeguards the rights of all parties in the framework of international law and human justice”. White House spokesperson Judd Deere said the objective of the Washington talks was to reach a “collaborative agreement” on the dam dispute. The dam, formally known as the Grand Renaissance Dam, has been built on the Blue Nile, which accounts for about 85 per cent of the Nile waters. The Blue Nile and the White Nile, which originates in central Africa, merge near Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, to become the Nile that flows downstream through the deserts of northern Sudan and into Egypt all the way to the Mediterranean coast. The most populous Arab state with 100 million people, Egypt is alarmed that the dam could significantly reduce its share of the Nile waters when a massive reservoir behind it is filled. The country is mostly desert and depends on the river for about 90 per cent of its water needs, yet it has publicly acknowledged the dam’s importance to the development of Ethiopia. Egypt, however, argues that bilateral co-operation could reduce the expected damage to levels that are easier to manage. Otherwise, it claims, millions of farmers will be out of work and the country’s food supply will be threatened. On the other hand, Ethiopia has a population matching Egypt’s and it views the hydropower dam as essential. The dam has become a symbol of national pride after millions of Ethiopians bought bonds to finance its construction. Historically, Ethiopia has resented Egypt’s domination over the Nile. Ethiopia’s proposal is to fill the reservoir over four to seven years, but Cairo insists that it must annually release 40 billion cubic meters of water, a proposal rejected by Addis Ababa on the grounds that it could not spare so much during drought spells. In an exhaustive report on the dispute released in March, the International Crisis Group quoted experts as saying the reservoir’s capacity, which is about 74 billion cubic meters, is bigger than what is needed for a dam intended to generate hydropower rather than store water for irrigation. Egypt’s high expectations for a successful mediation has given some analysts both hope and concern. Attiya Issawi, who has written on African affairs for Cairo's state Al Ahram daily for decades, said the good relations between the United States and both Egypt and Ethiopia were likely to facilitate the talks. "It will be difficult for Egypt or Ethiopia to reject any reasonable proposals made by the Americans," he told The National. "This round of talks will be better than previous ones and is very likely to produce a breakthrough." However, Abbas Sharaky, a geology and water resources professor who lectures at Cairo University’s college of High African Studies, believes the US invitation may have come too late, but pointed that the “important question now is what is the price for America’s mediation to resolve the issue?”

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Monday and voiced support for negotiations between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan over a giant hydroelectric dam on Ethiopia’s Blue Nile, the White House said. Egypt’s foreign minister said last week the Trump administration had invited the three countries to a meeting in Washington on Nov. 6 to try to break the deadlock in the talks. Egypt fears the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) could restrict already scarce supplies of water from the Nile, on which it is almost entirely dependent. Ethiopia says the dam is crucial to its economic development. “President Trump expressed support for Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan’s ongoing negotiations to reach a collaborative agreement on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. The statement did not mention any meeting in Washington. In recent weeks, Egypt has called for an external mediator on the issue, saying three-way talks have been exhausted. Ethiopia has previously rejected the idea, and is expected to start filling the reservoir behind the dam next year.

News article:
Nov 6 (Reuters) - Ethiopia is building a giant dam on the Blue Nile, close to its border with Sudan. Ethiopia says the hydropower project is crucial to its economic development. Egypt is worried the dam will affect flow of the Nile, its main source of fresh water. THE DAM The $4 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) was announced in early 2011, as Egypt was in political upheaval following a popular uprising that toppled former President Hosni Mubarak. The dam is the centrepiece of Ethiopia's bid to become Africa's biggest power exporter, with a projected capacity of more than 6,000 megawatts. Ethiopia has said it will start filling the reservoir behind the dam in 2020, though construction has been hit by delays. The first stage of the filling process is expected to take two years and bring the water level in the reservoir to 595 metres out of an eventual 632 metres. NILE WATERS The Nile Basin river system flows through 11 countries. The Blue Nile and White Nile merge in Sudan before flowing into Egypt and towards the Mediterranean. Egypt currently bases its share of the river's waters on a 1959 deal that gave it 55.5 billion cubic metres water annually, and Sudan 18.5 bcm. Other countries were not given allocations at that time. Ethiopia was not party to the agreement and does not recognise it. EGYPT'S POSITION Egypt, which has a rapidly growing population nearing 100 million, relies on the Nile for around 90% of its fresh water. Even without taking the dam into account, the largely desert country is short of water. It imports about half its food products and recycles about 25 bcm of water annually. Egypt accuses Ethiopia of not factoring in the risk of drought conditions such as those that affected the Nile Basin in the late 1970s and early 1980s. While acknowledging such a scenario is unlikely, Egypt says it could lose more than one million jobs and $1.8 billion in economic production annually. It therefore wants the first, two-year stage of the filling process to be extendable, and for Ethiopia to guarantee it 40 bcm per year after the first stage is completed. ETHIOPIA'S POSITION Ethiopia, with a population of more than 100 million people, accuses Egypt of trying to maintain a colonial-era grip over the Nile's waters. Addis Ababa says Cairo is trying to hold the project hostage by imposing rules over the filling and operation of the dam. It says it is taking the interests of Egypt and Sudan - the other downstream nation - into account, and that Egypt's requirement of a guaranteed 40 bcm is unrealistic. It also says that while it could fill the reservoir in two to three years, it made a concession by proposing a four to seven year process. Ethiopia has repeatedly rejected Egypt's suggestion of a fourth party mediator, saying Cairo is trying to sidestep three-way discussions. TALKS Both sides have accused each other of delaying negotiations, which resumed in Cairo and Khartoum in September and October, before stalling again. After Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi met Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on the sidelines of a summit in Russia in October, the two sides agreed to restart technical talks. Egypt has enthusiastically accepted an invitation from the U.S. to separate talks in Washington. (Writing by Aidan Lewis; Editing by Andrew Heavens)

News article:
The three African nations have said they will continue trying to resolve a conflict over plans for a massive Ethiopian-run dam along the Nile river. The project has raised concerns about shortages of drinking water. Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan made a commitment to resolving a dispute over a large Ethiopian-led dam project after US-led talks on Wednesday. The three nations issued a statement saying they would continue negotiations in talks to be held in Washington on December 9 and January 13 with the aim of finding a resolution by January 15 of next year. Read more: Water shortages pose growing risk to global stability "The ministers reaffirmed their joint commitment to reach a comprehensive, cooperative, adaptive, sustainable, and mutually beneficial agreement on the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and to establish a clear process for fulfilling that commitment in accordance with the 2015 Declaration of Principles," the statement read. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and World Bank President David Malpass also signed it. Big gains, big losses The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, in the works since 2011, is a massive Ethiopian hydroelectric dam project along the Nile river. Ethiopia plans to start filling and operating the reservoir in 2020, with the aim of eventually completing one of the world's biggest dams and becoming Africa's biggest power exporter. Once complete, the dam will generate about 6,450 megawatts of electricity, double Ethiopia's current output. The Nile provides both water and electricity to the 10 countries it passes through. Sudan and Egypt fear that the project could threaten their water supply. Egypt, which has suffered from a water crisis in recent years, relies on the river for 90% of its drinking water. After talks between the countries broke down earlier this year, Egypt asked the US to step in as a mediator. Peer mediation Water ministers from all three countries will attend the upcoming talks, as will the US Treasury and the World Bank. In the event a resolution is not reached by the January 15 deadline, the ministers agreed to then involve an international mediator. kp,se (AFP, Reuters) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.

The three nations issued a statement saying they would continue negotiations in talks to be held in Washington on December 9 and January 13 with the aim of finding a resolution by January 15 of next year.

US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and World Bank President David Malpass also signed it. Big gains, big losses The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, in the works since 2011, is a massive Ethiopian hydroelectric dam project along the Nile river. Ethiopia plans to start filling and operating the reservoir in 2020, with the aim of eventually completing one of the world's biggest dams and becoming Africa's biggest power exporter. Once complete, the dam will generate about 6,450 megawatts of electricity, double Ethiopia's current output. The Nile provides both water and electricity to the 10 countries it passes through. Sudan and Egypt fear that the project could threaten their water supply. Egypt, which has suffered from a water crisis in recent years, relies on the river for 90% of its drinking water. After talks between the countries broke down earlier this year, Egypt asked the US to step in as a mediator. Peer mediation Water ministers from all three countries will attend the upcoming talks, as will the US Treasury and the World Bank. In the event a resolution is not reached by the January 15 deadline, the ministers agreed to then involve an international mediator. kp,se (AFP, Reuters) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.

News article:
The Declaration of Principles on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is a win-win agreement for all concerned as it recognises the rights of all the signatory parties to the water of the Nile, writes Mostafa Ahmady Dedicated to preserving Egypt’s historical water quota from the River Nile, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi signed the Declaration of Principles on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) on 23 March 2015, along with the then leaders of Sudan and Ethiopia. In 10 Principles, the agreement stated, though not explicitly, Egypt’s historical rights to the river’s water. “Where significant harm nevertheless is caused to one of the countries, the state whose use causes such harm shall, in the absence of agreement to such use, take all appropriate measures in consultations with the affected state to eliminate or mitigate such harm and, where appropriate, to discuss the question of compensation,” reads Principle III of the agreement. Unfortunately, this agreement has nevertheless been branded by some for the sake of argument as the cause of the deadlock in the GERD talks. Yet, the simple facts show that the Egyptian negotiators, here citing the English text of the agreement itself, have done their best to ensure that no harm whatsoever would be inflicted on Egypt during the filling or operations of the dam. Here one must cite some studies done by Ethiopian researchers on the agreement. Endalcachew Bayeh from the Department of Civics and Ethical Studies at Ambo University in Ethiopia has produced a study entitled “Agreement on the Declaration of Principles on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam Project: A Reaffirmation of the 1929 and 1959 Agreements?” The title of this may give a clear-cut response to those vehemently criticising the agreement on the Egyptian side. In this study, dated 13 April 2016 which has received over 250,000 readings since it was first published, the researcher argues that the incorporation of Principle I of the agreement, sub-article 2, which reads “to cooperate in understanding upstream and downstream water needs in its various aspects” “will bind Ethiopia to consider such water demands of Egypt in its utilisation of Nile waters, thereby putting Ethiopia in a disadvantageous position.” More importantly, he goes on to say that “the treaty seems to be an instrument for securing and maintaining the water needs of Egypt. All the foregoing elements of the principle affirmatively work for Egypt. This, in turn, keeps Ethiopia loyal to the water interests of Egypt, thereby compromising its domestic interests.” His remarks in that department tell everybody concerned with the agreement that the Declaration of Principles was not a go-ahead for Ethiopia to proceed with the dam’s construction and that it was not the means by which Egypt legitimised this huge project, as some who have talked to hear the sound of their own voices have claimed. Instead, it, as best as it could be at the time of signature, was by far in favour of Egypt. Moreover, on the operation and filling of the GERD, the researcher says that the above article “shows the deterioration of an ownership right of the Ethiopians. This is due to the reason that the agreement subjects the dam to the joint management of the three countries.” The flawed and ineffective rhetoric that the agreement on the Declaration of Principles was in breach of the very principles of preserving Egypt’s water rights is thus ridiculous, to say the least. Even though they talked until they were blue in the face, those who opposed the agreement seemingly had not read its articles, or in the best-case scenario, never showed a proper understanding of it. Another study by three Ethiopian academics led by Minga Negash, the holder of a PhD in economics from the Metropolitan State University of Denver in the US, has suggested that the Declaration of Principles bypasses the Cooperative Framework Agreement reached in Entebbe, Uganda, in May 2010 for a new distribution of the waters of the Nile. According to a lengthy study entitled “Ethiopia: Perspectives on the Declaration of Principles regarding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam,” the phrase “principles of international law” in Principle I of the Agreement “neither implicitly nor explicitly recognises the existence of the Nile Basin Cooperative Framework Agreement.” The three researchers also argue that the above-mentioned principle was in complete harmony with the “spirit of the framework for cooperation that was signed between Egypt and Ethiopia in 1993,” referring to the agreement signed under former leaders of Egypt and Ethiopia, Hosni Mubarak and Meles Zenawi, respectively. The study also asserts that the intention behind the invocation of Principle I was to cite “the UN Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses” adopted on 21 May 1997. In other words, this means that the aforementioned phrase is another assertion of Egypt’s water-rights based on international criteria, given that the 1997 UN Convention stresses the infliction of no significant harm by upstream countries on downstream ones. The most important principle enshrined in the Tripartite Agreement between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan remains that “the purpose of the GERD is for power generation,” as stated in Principle III. Here, the study points out that the text of the agreement left no room for Ethiopia to utilise the Nile waters for any purpose whatsoever other than generating power. In reality, this article has prevented now and in the future any use of the waters around the dam for “fishing, recreation, education and small-scale industrial and irrigation projects,” as the study reveals. On the equitable utilisation of the Nile, Principle IV of the Agreement details the means of equitable distribution of the Nile waters, leaving no room for any speculation in that department either. The principle states that the equitable and reasonable utilisation of water has to consider, among other factors, the “existing and potential uses of the water resources” for the three nations. Moreover, the sub-articles attached to Principle IV “legitimise the increased demand for water by downstream countries,” as the study by the Minga Negash-led team elaborated. In other words, Egypt’s historical 55.5 billion cubic metres of Nile water and even any future demands are reaffirmed in the agreement. Thanks to Principle X of the Tripartite Agreement, Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan did find a way out of the current stalemate. The principle on the peaceful settlement of disputes stipulates, in case the three nations are incapable of resolving their disputes, that they may request “mediation”. Though it was not clearly announced that the meeting held this month in Washington DC was based on invoking Principle X, it remains effective towards that end. Upon an invitation from US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the foreign ministers of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan met in Washington in a bid to break the deadlock. In reality, the Trump administration sent a letter dated 21 October 2019 to the three nations to settle the standoff. The meetings, in which the World Bank participated, did outline a precise timeframe-based roadmap to end the dispute, something which Cairo has repeatedly requested and has now at last become a reality. The three nations agreed on the completion of a binding agreement by 15 January 2020, adding that should no agreement be reached by the deadline, Principle X of the Declaration of Principles on international mediation should be invoked. In effect, the agreement on the Declaration of Principles has been a win-win one, as it recognises the rights of all the signatory parties. Ethiopia will utilise the Nile for power-generation, without the use of waters around the dam for any other purpose. Egypt has reasserted its position on its historical quota of the Nile water and showed a good spirit in order not to stonewall development in the upstream nations. After seven years of building up tensions over the GERD, a binding and viable agreement looks attainable for the betterment of all the peoples living along the Nile. *The writer is a former press and information officer in Ethiopia and an expert on African affairs. *A version of this article appears in print in the 14 November, 2019 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly.

News article:
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg is expected to rule on November 12 on whether to mark exports of goods, produced in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Golan Heights, to European Union countries. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook STRONG> and Twitter This decision will be made following a petition filed by Psagot Winery to the Administrative Court of France against the 2015 EU directive to mark products manufactured in the West Bank, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem with a special label. Sign in French grocery store saying products are from Israeli settlements The Israeli foreign ministry fears that an ECJ precedent, which would require labeling products from the settlements, would be forced upon all 28 EU countries and embolden the BDS movement (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) and other de-legitimization organizations against Israel to fight Israeli exports. In addition, Israel is worried that the BDS movement will take advantage of the precedent and will call on countries outside Europe to mark the produce of the settlements. This decision is a follow-up to the European Union's guidelines approved in November 2015 for labeling products from the settlements, a move that has been criticized by Israel as "discriminatory" and damaging to peace efforts with the Palestinians. Thanks to efforts made by the Foreign Ministry and Israeli representatives around Europe, the implementation of the new guidelines was successfully blocked in most European countries. France became one of the first countries to adopt these guidelines, and in 2016 the French Ministry of Economy even issued its own guidelines requiring the marking of products from the settlements. Psagot Winery in the West Bank (Photo: Ofer Meir) The Administrative Court of France later annulled the decision until further notice after Psagot Winery, among others, filed a petition against marking its products, claiming that the directive contravenes the French constitution. Since it is a European regulation, the French court then forwarded the issue to the European Court of Justice in Luxemburg - a supreme court whose decisions cannot be appealed. The ruling might effectively provide practical tools to attack Israel and Israeli exports to Europe. Its public impact will be great, as stated, not only because of the implications for export but also in the delegitimization efforts against the State of Israel. The ruling will allow BDS activists to appeal to their local courts across the EU, which will be obliged to implement it without holding hearings on the matter. The Israeli Foreign Ministry is preparing for the decision. In the event of an unfavorable ruling for Israel, most of the activities of the Israeli embassies will be directed at the local ministries of economy and agriculture in order to to convince them not to apply the ruling or interpret it in a lightly.

News article:
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) will likely decide next week whether European law requires the discriminatory labeling of Jewish goods from disputed Israeli territories. Meanwhile, a series of articles have been spreading misinformation or “fake news” about the case quoting anonymous Israeli officials, and therefore the record has to be corrected. The case originated when the European Commission issued a non-binding notice claiming that European Union guidance requires labels on food products from eastern Jerusalem, the West Bank and Golan Heights that originate in Jewish “settlements” to include the derogatory indication “Israeli colony” or equivalent terms. Psagot Winery, supported by The Lawfare Project and represented by esteemed French Supreme Court Lawyer François-Henri Briard, sued the French government for its discriminatory application of the notice. France’s highest court, the Conseil d’État, referred the matter to the ECJ, asking the European court to assess whether E.U. law requires such labeling, and if not, whether E.U. states were free to implement such requirements. In June, the Advocate General (AG) of the European court declared in a non-binding opinion that he believes E.U. law requires such labeling. He further stated that while Israeli products from the “disputed territories” may not be labeled as “Products of Israel,” but rather must be labeled as products of “Israeli colonies,” Palestinian products from the exact same region may be designated as originating in “Palestine” rather than, for example, “Palestinian colonies.” This undeniably discriminatory approach seems to ignore the Oslo Accords, which expressly did not create a Palestinian state, but provided for both Israelis and Palestinians the same legal rights to live in the disputed territories until the Israeli government and Palestinian Liberation Organization reached a final agreement through negotiations. According to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s working definition of anti-Semitism, a contemporary example of anti-Semitism is “[a]pplying double standards by requiring of [Israel] a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.” In the product-labeling context, Israel is being held to a different standard than other nations deemed to be acting in violation of international law. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories For instance, the United Nations has declared that the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, Morocco and France are illegally occupying and colonizing certain territories, yet products from these nations have not been subjected to the labeling requirements enforced against Israel for allegedly engaging in the same type of conduct. On Nov. 12, the ECJ is expected to announce a decision on the limited questions before it only, and then the case will be remanded back to the French court to rule on according to French anti-discrimination law. There is no reason to believe the French court will agree with the AG’s reasoning, which in effect declares that Palestinian businesses should receive preferential treatment not afforded to Israeli businesses. Nor has there yet been a decision by a French court on this matter. Anonymous Israeli officials have been claiming that many E.U. countries have simply not been implemented the labeling guidelines, so it would have been better policy to just ignore them and pretend they didn’t exist. This is a misleading and dangerous position. Countries like Germany, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands and others have indeed been ramping up their enforcement of the European Commission guidelines on labeling and sending letters to E.U. importers. What these anonymous Israeli officials seem to be asking is for private companies to simply ignore the fact that their goods are being targeted for discriminatory treatment designed to cripple the Israeli export market. Despite the fake news disseminated by certain media outlets, this case has not and will not make things worse for Israeli exporters. If Psagot Winery had not brought suit, the door would have been left open for anyone to bring European importers to court in an attempt to force them to abide by the labeling regulations. Psagot’s legal case does not change this—it challenges those regulations themselves with the aim of preventing any future legal cases against Israeli products. Even in the event of an unfavorable decision from the ECJ, Psagot’s case will be remanded back to France, where it will be challenged on anti-discrimination grounds. Discriminatory labeling requirements that single out Israeli goods will likely be challenged in every European jurisdiction that attempts to implement them, on the basis of local anti-discrimination laws. Moreover, if there is an adverse ruling by the ECJ this month, the E.U. Parliament and Council could amend the food regulation at issue and annul its application with respect to West Bank and Golan Heights products, as was done in the Western Sahara Polisario case. The case before the ECJ was brought by an Israeli company exercising its legitimate rights to avail itself of the judicial process to protect its commercial interests, and by extension, the commercial interests of all Israeli companies that do business in Europe. Any concerns that this case could harm Israeli exporters further are completely unfounded, as even an unfavorable decision would not change the status quo. Before the case was brought, E.U. countries were enforcing the notice and the European Commission was touting the regulations as binding. It is deeply troubling that Israeli government officials would signal to the ECJ prior to its ruling that the Israeli government not only expects a negative decision, but is prepared to blame its own citizens for the outcome. Israel’s Foreign Ministry would be well-served to instruct its bureaucrats to spend more time defending Israeli interests abroad and less time demonizing Israeli companies behind the shameful cloak of anonymity.

News article:
Leading U.S. lawmakers warned the European Union that if they issue a mandate requiring Jewish products made in contested areas of Israel to carry consumer warning labels, this could trigger American anti-boycott laws and effectively jeopardize our trade with Europe, where anti-Semitism is becoming increasingly prevalent. The European Court of Justice (CJEU) is expected to issue an opinion this week on a long-running case brought forth by an Israeli winery challenging a requirement that Israeli-made products be labeled as coming from “settlements” and “Israeli colonies.” The decision, according to the Washington Free Beacon, is expected to be issued early Tuesday and follows a recent opinion by the EU court’s advocate general stating that European law requires these Jewish-made products to be labeled. Critics compared the law to Nazi-era boycotts of Jewish products and view such requirements as a win for the anti-Semitic Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, [aka BDS.] Question: If the EU wants to boycott Israeli products, why aren’t they also boycotting Turkish, Venezuelan, Iranian and Jordanian products, just for starters? Answer: Because the BDS movement is an anti-Semitic, Palestinian-led movement co-founded by Omar Baghouti, a man who calls for a one state solution and the dismantling of Israel, the only Jewish state on the planet. Barghouti attended Tel Aviv University but was overtly anti-Semitic. The school wanted him expelled but it never came to pass and he remained at the school where he received a masters degree in philosophy. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) petitioned EU ambassador to the United States Stavros Lambrinidis to raise concerns about a possible ruling in favor of the warning labels, stating that it could create policy tension with the United States and involve us in a boycott war with the EU. Sens. Benjamin Cardin (D-MD) and Rob Portman (R-OH) sent a similar letter to U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer expressing concerns that the ruling holds Israel to a standard no other country is subjected to, as mentioned above. Rep. Juan Vargas (D-CA) also sent a letter to U.S. ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland. It warned that the ruling would lead to discrimination against Israel, but of course, that’s exactly the intention. Advertisement The lawmakers stated that such a ruling could trigger multiple U.S. anti-boycott laws and damage the nearly $1.3 trillion in trade between America and the EU. “The regulation in question is problematic for a number of reasons, including because it targets specific businesses based on the ethnicity and national origin of their owners,” Menendez wrote in the Lambrinidis letter. “I am deeply concerned that if the CJEU decision empowers the EU to require or allow its Member States to label Israeli and Palestinian products in the manner proposed, it will allow and encourage the politicization of EU rules of origin labeling with potential adverse unintended consequences, including by opening the door to near-unlimited use of ‘ethical considerations’ in food labeling which would enable Member State protectionism and nationalism, and be unhelpful for the EU single market,” Menendez wrote. “Additionally, it could facilitate Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) tactics and de facto boycotts and discrimination against Israel, and its products, and potentially lead to discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, religion and nationality, contrary to existing EU policies and laws against BDS campaigns, Israel boycotts and discrimination,” the letter states. Advertisement A decision mandating the labeling of Jewish goods also would be seen as an effort by the EU to interfere in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, giving Hamas justification to continue their attacks on Israel. “The U.S. Federal Government and many U.S. states have enacted strong anti-boycott provisions that impose severe penalties and restrictions on companies that participate in boycotts or other economic pressure campaigns against Israel,” Menendez wrote. “If the CJEU decision empowers the EU to mandate or allow Member States to implement such labels which target Israeli businesses and exports there will be serious and far-reaching implications and unintended consequences.” So we will find out soon enough about the decision the EU is expected to make, but with the endemic problem of hatred for the Jews, don’t bet on a good outcome.

News article:
The European Court of Justice’s ruling earlier this week determining that the labeling of settlement goods is legally binding could seriously hurt ties between Israel and the European Union, Knesset speaker Yuli Edelstein warned on Thursday. In a letter to the president of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, Edelstein conveyed a “good measure of dismay and disappointment” over the EU court’s verdict. “I am gravely concerned that the court’s decision could undermine the political and economic ties between Israel and the European Union and have far-reaching, negative ramifications for the prospects of peace between Israel and its neighbors in the Middle East,” the Knesset speaker wrote to his counterpart. The verdict, handed down Tuesday by the EU’s top court in Luxembourg, “applies a double standard to Israel and the disputed territories under its control,” Edelstein went on. “Indeed, out of dozens of such areas around the world, I believe only Judea, Samaria and the Golan Heights are subject to such labeling regulations.” The judges also “chose to overlook the deep, historic connection between the Jewish people and the entire land of Israel,” he wrote. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Using the Biblical terms for the West Bank, Edelstein argued that Judea and Samaria should not be considered “occupied” by Israel “as they were never part of another country.” Israel’s control of these territories was legitimated by the Balfour Declaration, the 1920 San Remo Resolution and Article 80 Section 12 of the UN Charter, wrote Edelstein, a vociferous opponent of Palestinian statehood and strong supporter of Israel’s settlement project. Furthermore, the EU court ignored the “implausibility” of returning the Golan Heights to Syria, he added. Advertisement “At the same time, the court prescribed differential treatment for Arabs and Jews based on ethnicity by mandating that food labels not indicate merely ‘West Bank’ or ‘Golan Heights’ but specifically that the foods come from a Jewish settlement — lest consumers mistake these goods for Arab ones,” the Knesset speaker lamented in his letter. “By imposing this requirement, the court prejudges the outcome of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, in contradiction to the longstanding position of the European Union — and the international community as a whole — that bilateral steps and talks are the only way to resolve this conflict.” Edelstein added that the court’s verdict accused only Israel of violating international law but disregarded “the conduct of its enemies,” noting that this week Palestinian terrorists in Gaza fired hundreds of rockets at Israeli civilians. The “selective information” on which the court based its ruling “will inevitably result in a boycott of goods” from the settlements but also from Israel proper, he posited. “In doing so, the court has knowingly adopted the arguments long propounded by the BDS movement, whose extremist agenda aims to destroy the economy of Israel as a whole in order to force it to capitulate to the Palestinians.” If implemented, the court’s “disgraceful” verdict would undermine the EU’s ability to play a fair and objective role in the Middle East peace process, according to Edelstein. Advertisement Furthermore, it is “likely to result directly in many problems for Israel’s economic cooperation” with EU member states. Edelstein concluded his letter by urging Sassoli to get the European Parliament and member states’ parliaments to announce “their unqualified opposition to this unfortunate ruling.” A yet-unpublished study by a pro-Palestinian nonprofit in Brussels found that only 10 percent of settlement wines in European stores are labelled in accordance to EU’s labeling policy. The EU, meanwhile, took great pains this week to stress that it was not banning settlement goods and opposes boycotts and sanctions against Israel. “Products originating from the settlements outside the internationally recognized borders, i.e., before 1967, have not been blocked and will not be blocked from entry into the EU,” a spokesperson for the union’s Ramat Gan embassy told The Times of Israel on Wednesday. The Knesset speaker’s criticism of the EU court’s ruling joins that of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Israel Katz, as well as of the US State Department and various US congressmen. “Europe the other day decided to act against Israel, and to put labels on products that are made here,” Netanyahu said Wednesday. “They don’t join the sanctions against Iran, they join sanctions against Israel. Unbelievable!” Palestinian officials welcomed the court’s ruling, and urged European countries to implement “what is a legal and political obligation,” senior Palestine Liberation Organization official Saeb Erekat said in a statement. Advertisement “Our demand is not only for the correct labeling reflecting the certificate of origin of products coming from illegal colonial-settlements, but for the banning of those products from international markets,” he added. The court took on the case after Psagot Winery — which is located in a settlement by the same name just north of Jerusalem — challenged a 2016 ruling by a French court that said goods produced in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights must be labeled as originating in an “Israeli settlement.” In their decision Tuesday, the 15 judges wrote that it was necessary to label Israeli settlement goods as such “to prevent consumers from being misled as to the fact that the State of Israel is present in the territories concerned as an occupying power and not as a sovereign entity.” The court further stated that Israeli settlements “are characterized by the fact that they give concrete expression to a policy of population transfer conducted by that state outside its territory, in violation of the rules of general international humanitarian law.” A label that merely stated “Made in the West Bank” was insufficient, the court said, because customers would not have a way of knowing that the product they are considering purchasing originated in a locality established “in breach of the rules of international humanitarian law.”

News article:
Thirteen Israeli notables on Friday issued an open letter saying they welcomed the European Court of Justice’s ruling earlier this week that settlement products need to be labeled as such, but said the move is insufficient and the European Union must ban the import of settlement goods altogether. “Israeli settlements are the leading cause of human rights violations against Palestinians, and settlement expansion is destroying the possibility of a two-state solution. By banning goods that originate in Israeli settlements, Europe would help support the differentiation between Israel per se and settlements in the occupied territories,” reads the letter published in the Guardian. “We believe that the occupation is morally corrosive, strategically shortsighted, and thoroughly detrimental to peace. The international community has taken insufficient action in addressing this reality. Europe continues to support the occupation financially by allowing trade with Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law.” The letter was signed by former speaker of Knesset and head of the Jewish Agency Avraham Burg; former lawmaker Mossi Raz; former ambassador to France Prof. Eli Barnavi; former Israeli ambassador to South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe Ilan Baruch; former attorney general Prof. Michael Ben-Yair; former ambassador to South Africa and Turkey Alon Liel; former Israeli ambassador to the Czech Republic Erella Hadar; Israel Prize winners Prof David Harel, Prof Yehoshua Kolodny, Alex Levac, Prof David Shulman and Prof Zeev Sternhell; EMET Prize Laureate Miki Kratsman. The European Court of Justice took on the case after Psagot Winery — which is located in a settlement by the same name just north of Jerusalem — challenged a 2016 ruling by a French court that said goods produced in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights must be labeled as originating in an “Israeli settlement.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms In their decision Tuesday, the 15 judges wrote that it was necessary to label Israeli settlement goods as such “to prevent consumers from being misled as to the fact that the State of Israel is present in the territories concerned as an occupying power and not as a sovereign entity.” The court further stated that Israeli settlements “are characterized by the fact that they give concrete expression to a policy of population transfer conducted by that state outside its territory, in violation of the rules of general international humanitarian law.” A label that merely stated “Made in the West Bank” was insufficient, the court said, because customers would not have a way of knowing that the product they are considering purchasing originated in a locality established “in breach of the rules of international humanitarian law.” Advertisement According to the Luxembourg-based court, “Foodstuffs originating in the territories occupied by the State of Israel must bear the indication of their territory of origin, accompanied, where those foodstuffs come from an Israeli settlement within that territory, by the indication of that provenance,” the court — the EU’s highest legal instance — said in a press release. The Israeli government lambasted the ruling. “Europe the other day decided to act against Israel, and to put labels on products that are made here,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. “They don’t join exactly the sanctions against Iran, they join sanctions against Israel. Unbelievable!” The US State Department on Wednesday condemned the ruling in a statement later welcomed by Netanyahu, who said it demonstrated “moral clarity.” A spokesperson for the EU embassy in Ramat Gan told The Times of Israel on Wednesday that the union’s labeling requirement “is not discriminatory and it is not against Israel.” The union has a privileged trading relationship with Israel, and products originating in Israel proper benefit from preferential tariff treatment, she said. “The EU is the first trading partner for Israel with total trade in 2018 amounting to 34.4 billion euros,” she said. Products originating from the settlements outside Israel’s internationally recognized borders “have not been blocked and will not be blocked from entry into the EU,” she stressed. Advertisement “The EU does not support any form of boycott or sanctions against Israel,” the spokesperson added, stressing that the union rejects any attempt to isolate Israel, including BDS.

"The federal government reaffirms its stance on the Israeli settlement policy in the occupied areas. The construction of settlements is in the federal government’s opinion illegal, undermines the peace process and complicates talks on a two-state solution," the press release read. This comes a day after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the establishment of Israeli villages in the Palestinian land "is not, per se, inconsistent with international law," reversing the decades-old US policy on the issue. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said hours later that the bloc urged Israel to stop settlement construction in the West Bank. The Foreign Office said Berlin together with its EU partners supported "a mutually acceptable negotiated solution" that would satisfy legitimate demands of both Israel and Palestine. Israel has built over 120 settlements in the contested area over the past decades. Unlike Israel and the United States, the international community sees their presence and expansion as illegal and considers them to be a major obstacle on the way to lasting peace.

This week, headlines worldwide reported upon a new European Union requirement that goods produced in Israeli settlements must not carry the generic “Made in Israel” tag and must be specially labeled. In reaction to this decision, across America, Israel and civilized people worldwide, there was outrage. For example, The United States State Department said that the ruling encourages the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. The State Department said the U.S. “unequivocally opposes” any efforts to “economically pressure, isolate, or otherwise delegitimize Israel.” Israel’s Foreign Ministry said this decision sets a “double standard” that unfairly singles out Israel when there are dozens of territorial disputes around the world. Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, said the decision was “another example of Europe continuing its surrender to Israel’s enemies. The EU’s discrimination against the Zionist enterprise will provide legal cover for anti-Semitism.”NGO Monitor said product labelling is “a stepping stone for full-fledged BDS against Israel, particularly in Europe.” In Israel across the political spectrum this labeling has been attacked. There is no difference between products produced across the Green Line and those produced in Israel proper, Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid said and noted that this ruling was “effectively a call for the de facto boycott of Israel,” an “irresponsible move”, “a direct continuation of the boycott movement against Israel, which is anti-Semitic and misguided,” and a “stain on the EU. Avigdor Lieberman sarcastically suggested stamping settlement goods with yellow stars (a reference to the Holocaust). The head of the Jewish Agency, and former Labor Party leader, Isaac Herzog, conjured a parallel between the E.U.’s decision and the U.N.’s 1974 “Zionism is Racism” resolution, which his father, Chaim Herzog, Israel’s U.N. ambassador at the time, famously denounced. Herzog continued to note that to mark products made in factories over the Green Line is “a prize for terror.” Former justice minister head Ayelet Shaked said the ruling had a “stench of antisemitism,” explaining that there is no similar mandate with regard to any other territorial conflict, such as Tibet, Cyprus and Western Sahara. Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, an American Jewish leader bought ads this week in the New York Times, featuring a large bottle of wine labeled with a Jewish star reminiscent of the stars worn in Nazi Germany. “For centuries, and most famously in the 1930s, Jews and their businesses were labeled by Europeans,” the ad reads. “Now, just decades after the Holocaust, they’re at it again.”“True to form and history, Europe’s actions are only against Israel and Jews,” the ad reads. “The EU does not label olive oil from Turkish-occupied Northern Cyprus, nor fish from Moroccan-occupied Western-Sahara, nor Goji berries and, most significantly, gold and other resources being plundered from Chinese-occupied Tibet. “Singling out Jewish businesses means Europe’s latest measures has nothing to do with justice,” it continues. “It’s a centuries-old, uniquely European prejudice: naming and shaming Jews.” Eugene Kontorovich, a professor at George Mason University’s school of law said, “Now Jewish products are the only ones to have to bear special labels based on their origin. This is a new kind of yellow star put exclusively on Jewish goods,” referring to the badge Jews throughout Nazi-occupied Europe were forced to wear as a means of identification. Yet, you know who celebrated? The radical extremist American Jewish non-profit, The New Israel Fund, who continue to openly advocate and financially support a boycott of Israel. This policy of the European Union is perfectly in line with the policies of The New Israel Fund. As their website states, the NIF will “not deny funding to organizations that call for a boycott of settlement products…” In plain English, $30 Million Dollars a year is raised from American Jews to boycott post-1967 Israel – including the Western Wall, Ma’aleh Adumim, Shiloh and other Israeli cities. The NIF supports a boycott of Israel. Donors to the New Israel Fund include Oz Benamram, the Bertha Foundation, Moriah Fund, Sparkplug Foundation, Firedoll Foundation and Telos Group. Shame on them and all donors to NIF.

News article:
The European Court of Justice has ruled that Jewish products from Israeli-controlled territories must be singled out for punitive labeling if they are to be sold in European Union countries. This attack on Israel’s economy is a blow to America’s most important ally in the Middle East. What largely has been absent from the debate about the EU decision — which penalizes Israel alone among over 100 countries involved in territorial conflicts across the world — is the apparent Nazi and neo-Nazi origins of the measure. The EU’s top court seeks to punish the Jewish state because of its presence in the disputed territories of the West Bank, Golan Heights and East Jerusalem. Instead of encouraging direct negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel over these contested territories as part of an eventual peace deal, the EU appears to have chosen to wage economic warfare against Israel. The ideological basis for the anti-Israel labeling penalty is clear: In 2012, Germany’s National Democratic Party (NPD) submitted a bill in the parliament of the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to single out Israeli products. The NPD initiative called for “Palestinian and Israeli products” to be labeled and for a “clear designation of origin” to be implemented. The following year, Germany’s powerful Green Party introduced an initiative in the Bundestag that mirrored this legislation. Henryk M. Broder, a well-known German-Jewish journalist who has testified about modern anti-Semitism in the German parliament, wrote a column in a Swiss weekly, titled “Two Souls, One Thought,” that the NPD and Green parliamentary initiatives to demarcate Israeli products are “at their core identical.” The EU measure targeting Israel, Broder continued, is grounded in pre-World War II Nazi ideology. The NPD and Green initiatives follow the model of the Third Reich’s boycott of Jewish businesses that began on April 1, 1933, and invoked the slogan: “Germans, defend yourselves. Do not buy from Jews!” Economic warfare designed to destroy German Jews’ ability to support their families in the 1930s was part and parcel of the buildup to the Holocaust during WWII. The difference today, of course, is that European Jews can emigrate to Israel to escape the resurgent tide of anti-Semitism endemic in many EU member nations. Unfortunately, there appears to be support among some German diplomats and political parties for punishing Israeli producers. To the credit of the Trump administration, the U.S. vehemently opposes the mandatory labeling of Jewish products. A U.S. official told The Washington Free Beacon: “I think we’ve been clear that we think this is consistent with the BDS movement and we think the BDS movement is antisemitic.” Clearly, the EU labeling system could provide a huge shot to the extreme anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. In May, the Bundestag voted to classify BDS as an anti-Semitic movement. However, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government apparently has not stopped funding NGOs that support BDS activities in the Federal Republic and across the Middle East. Germany, the most influential country within the EU, could help put an end to the draconian labeling measure. Merkel, whom the World Zionist Organization honored last month with the prestigious Theodor Herzl Award for “exceptional efforts on behalf of Israel and the Zionist cause,” can prove she deserves such accolades by telling those who oppose Israel that Germany will reject any resurrection of anti-Jewish measures that echo the genocidal Nazis, old or new.

News article:
Last month's decision by the European Court of Justice which insisted on the labelling of Israeli goods produced on the illegal settlements in occupied Palestine, has been denounced as an attack on the Jewish people, by a member of the Israeli government. The astonishing rebuke, which implied that the legal decision was anti-Semitic, was directed at the European Union's top court, by former Israeli minister and senior Likud figure, Gideon Sa'ar, during the Israel Allies Foundation conference in Jerusalem this morning. In the meeting attended by several legislators from various parts of the world, Sa'ar denounced the court for not "acting legally" and accused them of conveying a "lack of moral clarity." His accusations, however, are at odds with international law, as the EU's top court affirmed through last month's judgement. Under international law, settlements are illegal, as is the transfer of civilian population to an illegally occupied territory. Israel contests this international consensus, however. Amongst its justification for denying Palestinians the rights and provisions granted to Jews in the occupied territory, is its claim that the land it calls Judea and Samaria, was given to the Jewish people by God, almost three millenniums ago. READ: Israel settlers led by Yehuda Glick storm Al-Aqsa compound Sa'ar announced to the participants, consisting mainly of religious figures, that the court's decision "is an attempt to delegitimise the right of the Jewish people to live and build our future in the land of our forefathers." Insisting that the Jewish people cannot be "occupiers" in their own land, " Sa'ar concluded by calling on the EU, and on governments around the world, not to be "blind to the truth" and to "show moral clarity, when it comes to the conflict, and all the issues in the Middle East." Sa'ar's remarks follow a series of controversial moves that critics deem are intended to normalise Israel's colonisation. The latest in this sequence of provocative steps saw the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, upending international norms, by recognising Israel's annexation of Palestinian territory. "Arguments about who is right and who is wrong as a matter of international law will not bring peace" Pompeo proclaimed while disposing of the legal framework for determining right from wrong, in such matters. The remarks were widely denounced for relegating Palestine to an extra-legal matter, as though it were a lawless frontier beyond the purview of universally accepted norms of behaviour. This trend has raised concerns that it will accelerate the retreat of a multi-national system, founded on the ideals of a rules-based international order, with respect for human rights and minorities.

News article:
The UK Labour Party's leader Jeremy Corbyn has demanded an urgent meeting of the Privy Council over the US killing of Iran's Major General Qasem Soleimani and following the Pentagon's announcement that it will send 3,000 more troops to the Middle East. Mr Corbyn wrote a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, outlining a series of questions that he thinks should be discussed, including measures the UK should take to ensure the safety of its nationals. "Given the serious nature of the issues now faced by our country and indeed the world as a consequence of the US attack, I would welcome a prompt response to this request and stand ready to attend any briefing meeting as soon as arranged," Corbyn wrote. The Labour leader described the attack as an "assassination", calling on the UK government to resist the "belligerent actions" from the US.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said in a phone call that Iran must comply with the terms of the nuclear deal agreed with major powers and cannot be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon. Iran said on Sunday it was taking a further step back from its commitments to abandon limits on enriching uranium after Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander Qassem Soleimani was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Iraq. "The leaders discussed the situation in Iraq following the death of Qassem Soleimani. They agreed on the importance of reducing tensions and finding a diplomatic way through the current crisis," a statement from Johnson's office said.

News article:
President Trump late Tuesday tweeted his support for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's idea to scrap the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal and replaced it with a new proposal designed and negotiated by the Trump administration. BORIS JOHNSON SAYS TRUMP SHOULD DESIGN HIS OWN NUKE DEAL Trump was likely referring to an interview that the United Kingdom leader had with the BBC on Monday where he called his U.S. counterpart "a great deal maker, by his own account and others," and expressed a willingness to let Trump take the lead on the matter. "If we're going to get rid of it, let's replace it and let's replace it with the Trump deal," Johnson said. Trump tweeted late Tuesday the quote from the interview and the line, “I agree!” The U.S. pulled out from the Obama-era agreement in 2018. Trump devoted much of his time while running for office mocking the international agreement for being too soft on the Iranian regime. Trump took a major gamble earlier this month when he approved the drone killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Iran’s immediate response to fire missiles at bases holding U.S. troops in the region was considered by many to be contained. There were no reports of casualties. But some Middle East experts warn that Tehran and some of its proxies may still be planning a more meaningful retaliation. The Trump administration has said it is not focused on regime change in the country, but—at least for the time—appears to be in a powerful negotiating position with Tehran. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was at Stanford University on Monday and said the administration’s goal is to one day see Iran “behave like a normal nation. Just be like Norway,” he said, according to the New York Times. Fox News' Danielle Wallace contributed to this report

News article:
President Trump late Tuesday tweeted his support for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's idea to scrap the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal and replaced it with a new proposal designed and negotiated by the Trump administration. BORIS JOHNSON SAYS TRUMP SHOULD DESIGN HIS OWN NUKE DEAL Trump was likely referring to an interview that the United Kingdom leader had with the BBC on Monday where he called his U.S. counterpart "a great deal maker, by his own account and others," and expressed a willingness to let Trump take the lead on the matter. "If we're going to get rid of it, let's replace it and let's replace it with the Trump deal," Johnson said. Trump tweeted late Tuesday the quote from the interview and the line, “I agree!” The U.S. pulled out from the Obama-era agreement in 2018. Trump devoted much of his time while running for office mocking the international agreement for being too soft on the Iranian regime. Trump took a major gamble earlier this month when he approved the drone killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Iran’s immediate response to fire missiles at bases holding U.S. troops in the region was considered by many to be contained. There were no reports of casualties. But some Middle East experts warn that Tehran and some of its proxies may still be planning a more meaningful retaliation. The Trump administration has said it is not focused on regime change in the country, but—at least for the time—appears to be in a powerful negotiating position with Tehran. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was at Stanford University on Monday and said the administration’s goal is to one day see Iran “behave like a normal nation. Just be like Norway,” he said, according to the New York Times. Fox News' Danielle Wallace contributed to this report

News article:
"They will do their damnedest to sabotage it. They've moved from ‘remain’ to ‘rejoin’. So they want to be called re-joiners. You'd think after the December election they'd be begging for forgiveness. But instead, they want to re-join the EU", Freddy Vachha, a UKIP national campaign manager, said. The bill overcame resistance from pro-EU elements in both chambers of the British parliament to gain the royal assent last week. This was made possible by the ruling Conservative party's landslide victory in December's election. The UK is set to formally exit the EU on Friday, triggering an 11-month transition period in which the two will try to negotiate an amicable trade deal. EU officials have cast doubt on whether such a pact is possible within months, despite otherwise optimistic sounds from Prime Minister Boris Johnson. But Vachha argued that no transitional period would suffice if enough people in the civil service, including many in both chambers of parliament, were determined to "make Brexit fail".

News article:
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in London on Wednesday seeking reassurances over China that could let the two old allies continue sharing intelligence and strike a post-Brexit trade deal. The first leg of a five-nation tour that also takes in Ukraine comes with Britain facing a historic crossroads as it parts ways with the European Union after nearly 50 years on Friday night. US President Donald Trump has long backed Brexit and trusted the ability of Prime Minister Boris Johnson -- a headline-grabbing leader he once compared to himself -- to set Britain on a more independent and pro-American course. Yet Johnson has confounded expectations and sided with Europe on everything from the need to save the Iran nuclear deal that Trump abandoned to the importance of China's Huawei tech giant to speedy 5G mobile. Pompeo said Britain's decision to ignore months of US warnings and give Huawei a limited but still leading role Tuesday was "something we'll have a conversation about". "We will make sure that when American information passes across a network we are confident that that network is a trusted one," Pompeo told reporters on his way to London. "It's a little unclear precisely what they're going to permit and not permit so we need to take a little bit of time to evaluate that." Johnson told parliament his government will "do absolutely nothing to imperil our relationship with the US". But a senior UK official conceded that Pompeo's private dinner Wednesday with Foreign Secretary Domic Raab and meeting with Johnson on Thursday in Downing Street might be tense. "In any mature relationship there are issues on which we don't agree," the British official said. "We will have a candid conversation." Some security analysts said Britain's exclusion of Huawei from "core" parts of the network may give Washington sufficient grounds to continue sharing intelligence and scale down the dispute. "Essentially what they've done is limit Huawei from large parts of the network," said the Royal United Services Institute think-tank's cyber research chief James Sullivan. Pompeo noted the UK concession but said it was unclear how it was going to work. "We have to see what that means from an execution and implementation perspective," Pompeo said. Johnson also took sounded a positive note about a Middle East peace plan that the Palestinians rejected even before Trump unveiled it alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday. "No peace plan is perfect but this (one) has the merit of a two-state solution," Johnson said. Both Johnson and Trump have incentives to preserve their "special relationship" in the post-Brexit age. Johnson's government has touted Britain's ability to strike a lucrative trade deal with the United States as one of the big advantages of leaving the EU. Britain will lose its privileged access to the single European market -- the world's largest and most important for UK trade -- once the post-Brexit transition window shuts at the end of the year. And Trump could benefit politically from a trade deal with a major partner in the run-up to November's presidential election. Trump pledged last month to push for a "massive" post-Brexit trade deal with Johnson. The chances of one getting the Congress in the heat of the US election campaign appear remote. But the two leaders could sign off on a bare-bones agreement that helps ease future talks. Pompeo said London and Washington had "enormous trade issues" to discuss. A deal is being complicated by Trump's unpopularity in Britain and domestic pressure on Johnson to stand up to the United States. UK media took huge offence at Washington's refusal to extradite the wife of a US diplomat who is using the cover of diplomatic immunity to avoid prosecution over the death of a teenager in a road accident in England. A US prosecutor's complaint Monday that Britain's Prince Andrew was stonewalling an FBI investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein only added to the layers of tensions.

News article:
LONDON (Reuters) - The United Kingdom leaves the European Union at 2300 GMT on Friday but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has a bulging to do list for what he has cast as a “new dawn” for the country. Below are the biggest issues he has to deal with. TRADE As soon as the United Kingdom formally leaves the EU on Jan. 31 it can start negotiating trade deals with other countries. The European Union - which accounts for about half of the United Kingdom’s trade - along with the United States are the government’s top priority for securing new trade deals. A sticking point in U.S. talks will be a British proposal for a unilateral digital services tax, despite a U.S. threat to levy retaliatory tariffs on British-made autos. ‘DIS-UNITED KINGDOM’ Brexit strained the bonds which tie the United Kingdom together: England and Wales voted to leave the EU but Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay. Scottish nationalists are pushing for an independence referendum which Johnson says he will not allow. Irish nationalists also want a referendum on uniting Ireland. Slideshow ( 9 images ) TRUMP AND CHINA Johnson granted Huawei a limited role in Britain’s 5G mobile network on Tuesday, frustrating a global attempt by the United States to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant from the West’s next-generation communications. It is unclear what impact the decision will have on relations with the Untied States - the United Kingdom’s closest ally. China has also cautioned the United Kingdom for what it says is meddling in Hong Kong - its former colony. ‘ECONOMY, STUPID’ Ahead of the December election, Johnson said he would spend more on the National Health Service, infrastructure and ensure prosperity across the United Kingdom. In translation, that means more borrowing: more UK government bonds sold. Some businesses are reporting a post-election “Boris bounce” recovery, and finance minister Sajid Javid says he is hopeful that Britain’s economic growth can eventually bounce back to its pre-financial crisis levels of nearly 3% a year. LONDON FINANCIAL CLOUT Britain’s vast financial services sector’s future access to the European Union’s will be one of the first issues to be discussed and must be finalised by the end of June. Slideshow ( 9 images ) The finance industry want to maintain a close relationship with the EU but it will not enjoy the same level of access as under the bloc’s single market, which includes a so-called passporting regime. Instead, the government will be looking for the EU to make ruling based on equivalence where each side decides if the other’s rules for financial stability and investor protection are sufficiently aligned with its own to grant access. The EU has indicated it will use the threat of restricting access for Britain’s biggest export industry as leverage for wider demands such as fishing access to UK waters. IRAN While London has repeatedly said it wants the nuclear deal with Iran to succeed despite Trump’s abandonment of the pact, Johnson has called for a new Trump deal to replace it. As the United Kingdom forges a post-Brexit foreign policy, Iran could give the best indication of its future orientation: will Johnson ultimately side with the United States or keep the United Kingdom aligned with the EU’s Germany and France? NEW TEAM? After Brexit, Johnson is planning a reshuffle of his cabinet team of top ministers. (This story has been refiled to add dropped word in first paragraph)

News article:
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo predicted Thursday that Brexit would bring "enormous benefits" to the United States and the UK, as he wound down a visit to Britain on the eve of its historic departure from the European Union. The chief US diplomat also played down a dispute about Britain's decision to plug in Chinese technology into its next-generation mobile network, suggesting that Washington would continue sharing intelligence with London. "There were things that the United Kingdom was required to do as part of being a member of the EU, and they'll be able to do them differently now," Washington's top diplomat told a think-tank audience in London. "Some of this will be worked out through the free trade agreement, some of it will be worked out by entrepreneurs just kicking it," he said, alongside British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. "You will see the enormous benefits that accrued to both of our nations as a result of this." Britain will enter a new chapter when it becomes the first country to quit the EU's institutions at midnight Brussels time (2300 GMT) on Friday. "It is a great moment for our country... a moment of hope and opportunity," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Wednesday, as he prepared to address the nation at 2200 GMT Friday -- an hour before Brexit. Pompeo paid a courtesy visit to Johnson before flying to Kiev, the second leg of his five-nation tour that includes four former Soviet republics. Although Britain will remain under most EU rules during an 11-month transition period, it is then likely to lose privileged access to the single European market -- the world's largest and most important for UK trade. Johnson has argued he can negotiate ambitious free trade agreements with both his 27 former partners and the US, but has seen recent strains in the so-called "special relationship" with Washington. Britain has been angered by American refusal to extradite the wife of a US diplomat who is using the cover of diplomatic immunity to avoid prosecution over the death of a teenager in a road accident in England. Johnson's hopes for a US trade deal are also complicated by US President Donald Trump's unpopularity in Britain and domestic pressure to stand up to Washington. The British premier has defied expectations since taking power last July by failing to side with the United States on everything from the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump has abandoned, to working with Chinese tech giant Huawei. Trump -- a long-time fan of Brexit and Johnson's ability to deliver it successfully -- has publicly urged Britain to rethink, yet has so far been restrained in his criticism. But others, including Republican senators who will have to sign off on a future US-UK trade deal, have cautioned that sharing intelligence and striking an agreement could be imperilled by the Huawei decision in particular. Pompeo sounded a more positive note on Thursday. He said the US-UK intelligence sharing relationship would remain "deep" and "strong" and that he was "confident" the next generation of technology would be secure. However, he warned strongly about Beijing's growing global influence, calling China's ruling Communist Party "the central threat of our times" that challenges Western principles. Britons narrowly backed departing the EU in a 2016 referendum that left the country locked in political crisis and acrimonious division. Johnson, who headed the pro-Leave campaign, won a thumping election victory in December on the mantra "get Brexit done". That is now finally happening, with Britain's departure set in European law Wednesday, amid emotional scenes, as the bloc's parliament voted to ratify the divorce papers. "We will always love you and we will never be far," said EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, adding: "Long live Europe." Britain's eurosceptic lawmakers were in triumphant mood after two decades as a thorn in Brussels' side, brandishing British flags in contravention of the chamber's rules.

Britons narrowly backed departing the EU in a 2016 referendum that left the country locked in political crisis and acrimonious division. Johnson, who headed the pro-Leave campaign, won a thumping election victory in December on the mantra "get Brexit done". That is now finally happening, with Britain's departure set in European law Wednesday, amid emotional scenes, as the bloc's parliament voted to ratify the divorce papers. "We will always love you and we will never be far," said EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, adding: "Long live Europe." Britain's eurosceptic lawmakers were in triumphant mood after two decades as a thorn in Brussels' side, brandishing British flags in contravention of the chamber's rules.

News article:
This week sees the biggest shift in British foreign policy in almost 50 years, as the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. As an EU member, the UK shaped Europe’s foreign policy, from EU sanctions on Russia to the Iran nuclear deal. The UK wants to stay an influential European foreign policy power. But how can it outside the EU? When European foreign ministers discussed Iran this month the Brits were there; in future they won’t be. The UK can still play a leading role in shaping Europe’s foreign policy after Brexit — but it will need to engage with Europe differently. Up to 2016, British foreign policy was based on three pillars. First, Atlanticism. London routinely aligned with Washington on international issues and acted as a transatlantic bridge, explaining European views to the United States and vice versa. Second is leadership in the EU — specifically, the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Third, multilateralism. As a medium-sized power with global interests, an effective rules-based international order was central to advancing British interests. Each of these pillars is now challenged. First, Brexit takes the UK out of the CFSP. Second, the rules-based international order is being undermined by Russia, China and, to an extent, the U.S. Third, Washington’s transatlantic outlook under the Trump administration has become more nationalistic, transactional and mercantile, with skepticism — sometimes even hostility — toward the EU and NATO. The English Channel and the Atlantic have both widened since 2016. The UK’s traditional diplomatic handling of foreign policy crises — align with Washington and shape the EU response — no longer applies. So how can the UK lead European foreign policy after Brexit? Through four new steps. First, by doing more bilaterally with European counties — especially France and Germany. New summits, dialogues and agreements could be launched. Second, by using meetings of other international groupings to coordinate European foreign policy positions and actions. The so-called “E3” (Germany, France and the UK) works well on Iran — Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Boris Johnson issued a joint statement on Soleimani — and could be expanded to other issues. The Group of Seven (G7) could play a bigger foreign policy role too. Third, as part of this year’s negotiations on the UK’s future trade and security relationship with the EU, London and Brussels could agree to close co-operation on foreign policy. Various new mechanisms are possible. French President Macron has suggested creating a European Security Council including the UK. Alternatively, the UK could occasionally be invited to attend meetings of EU foreign ministers, as John Kerry did as U.S. secretary of State. Joint UK-EU statements could even be considered if the UK and EU wanted to show a united stance – including to Moscow and Beijing – such as after a use of chemical weapons. Fourth, by working closely with the EU in other international organizations, particularly the United Nations. This would also help bolster multilateralism, and show the UK remains globally orientated. Europe should support these steps. In or out of the EU, the UK is a major European political and military power, and one of only two European nuclear states and permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. European views will pack more punch globally if the Brits are also on board. Growing transatlantic tensions also mean Brussels, Paris and Berlin should keep London within the European foreign policy orbit instead of seeing it adopt a more Trumpian outlook. Against a geo-political backdrop of transatlantic divisions, Britain’s ability to lead European foreign policy after Brexit will ultimately depend on the strategic posture it chooses to adopt between Europe and the US. In short, will the UK align more with Washington on foreign policy after Brexit? Does the UK see its interests and values remaining European? Or will it adopt a policy of strategic equidistance? Despite Brexit, since the 2016 referendum the UK has supported the EU, not the US, on major transatlantic disagreements — including Iran, trade, climate change and China. Brussels and Washington will look closely at whether this continues or changes. The UK wants trade deals with both.

As Britain contemplates one of the most important shifts in its foreign policy, it should maintain its security links with Europe, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) said. In a report on the importance of the UK’s national interest in policy, the British think tank also said the country should increase its capability for action without the US. “The first priority should be to respond to security threats to the UK homeland, both from competitor states and from non-state actors,” wrote the report’s author, the institute deputy director general Prof Malcolm Chalmers. “Maintaining strong security partnerships with European allies is vital to tackling threats to the UK and its immediate neighbourhood.” Speaking at RUSI's Britain in the World event on Monday, Professor Lawrence Freedman said Britain needed to begin reappraising its place in the world using realism as its starting point. "The government still insists we are outward looking and internationalists in spirit. Rather than what might have been Britain First we have Global Britain," he said, explaining if Britain was to retain its position of international prestige it needed to make a case for its continued importance. British MP Tom Tugendhat, Chair of the House of Common's Foreign Affairs Committee, said changes in EU member states, such as the electoral gains made by Sinn Fein in Ireland, would continue to have profound effects on the UK, despite Brexit. "This change in Europe is going to be a really defining moment for us," he said. The RUSI report goes on to say the UK was unlikely to move into a closer or more subservient position to the US after its exit from Europe. Instead, it said Britain should expect more autonomy from both traditional partners. “A more likely scenario is that the UK is moving towards a situation of regulatory autonomy in relation to both its major partners, rather than a wholesale shift from one to the other,” the report said. It said that, where possible, Britain should “increase its capability for action without the US”. In the run-up to its exit from the EU on January 31, Britain stuck closely to its European partners in its response to the Iran nuclear crisis. Britain, France and Germany have urged Tehran to resume compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal despite Washington’s abandonment of the agreement. But British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has welcomed US President Donald Trump’s plan for peace in the Middle East more emphatically than have other European leaders. At the same time, Britain and the US have clashed bitterly over the UK’s decision to allow Chinese company Huawei limited access to run its new 5G network, against Mr Trump’s wishes.

News article:
TEHRAN: Iran’s constitutional watchdog has barred thousands of people from running in next month’s parliamentary elections, including 90 current lawmakers, most of whom are accused of corruption. The Guardian Council, a body of senior clerics and legal experts, vets candidates for office as well as legislation, and rules out individuals if it believes their views or behavior are incompatible with the theocratic system. Half its members are appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. A spokesman for the Guardian Council was quoted by the hard-line Kayhan paper as saying most of the lawmakers were rejected for “financial problems,” a reference to fraud and embezzlement. The spokesman, Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei, said more than 14,000 people registered to run in December. Of those, just 5,000 qualified, he said. Of the 290 current members of Parliament, 247 registered to run for re-election. Those rejected can appeal the decision in the coming days. The reformist newspaper Etemad said on Tuesday that most of those rejected were reformist and moderate candidates. It said that as a result the elections will essentially be an “internal vote” among hard-liners. Hard-liners were also disqualified, but it’s not clear how many. The elections will test the popularity of the pro-reform bloc led by President Hassan Rouhani. They have championed improved ties with the West and expanded social freedoms, but have suffered major setbacks since President Donald Trump assumed office. Iran regularly holds presidential and parliamentary elections, but they are closely supervised by the clerical establishment, and the supreme leader has the final say on all major policies.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print Maryam Rajavi: Boycotting mullahs’ illegitimate election is a patriotic duty and the nation’s pledge to martyrs of the uprising Written by Secretariat of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) on 05 February 2020. MARYAM RAJAVI: REGIME’S INTENSIFYING FACTIONAL FEUDING, DEEPENS INTERNAL SCHISM BOYCOTT OF ILLEGITIMATE ELECTION IS A PATRIOTIC DUTY The Iranian regime’s supreme leader Ali Khamenei, grappling with the nightmare of his overthrow subsequent to the recent November and January uprisings, and reeling from irreparable blow he suffered with the elimination of Qassem Soleimani, is poised to institute a unipolar regime. Khamenei wants to consolidate his authority with the formation of a one-faction Parliament to forestall his regime’s inevitable overthrow. After completing an unprecedented purge of parliamentary candidates, Khamenei warned those “who were elected through elections, but undercut elections,” and scolded his rival faction, “How is it that when an election is in your favor, it is correct and definitive, but when not in your favor, it is defective?” Addressing his president, Hassan Rouhani, who on January 27 had described the election as appointments because of the purge of his faction’s candidates, Khamenei said, “When you falsely claim this election has been engineered or is not an election, you discourage the people.” https://twitter.com/iran_policy/status/1222973474794242048 Khamenei added, “The Guardian Council has a standing in the Constitution and is a trustworthy institution. How can one so easily accuse this institution as being biased toward some people?” Khamenei revealed his dread of public apathy and rejection of the election farce and said, “Someone may not like me, but if that person likes Iran, he/she must cast a vote. Thus, anyone who likes Iran and the country’s security, wants to see the problems resolved and wants to see the correct turnover of the elite, should participate in the election.” According to state-run media, the Guardian Council has disqualified 90 of the sitting members of the parliament, some of whom have served three terms. Candidates in 170 districts are from Khamenei’s faction and the main candidates of the rival faction in other districts have been eliminated, such that ultimately 260 seats will go to the faction most aligned with Khamenei and 30 to the so-called moderate factions. The rival faction is warning about widespread boycott of the election and the regime’s “implosion,” describing the Guardian Council’s purges as “a looming danger to the foundation of the Islamic Republic.” It has appealed to Khamenei to allow it to compete in the election in order to increase voter participation. On January 15, Rouhani said, “Do not disturb the people, don’t tell the people that for every parliamentary seat there are 17, 170 or 1,700 candidates. From how many factions? One? This cannot be an election. One cannot run the country with one faction.” Rouhani’s spokesman, Ali Rabiei said on February 3rd, “An indication of resistance to conduct that will implode Iran (regime) is the presence of us all at the ballot box. All of us must be present, whether critics or those who are worried.” The regime is planning wholesale fraud and rigging. Mostafa Mirsalim, affiliated with Khamenei’s faction, has already foretold the participation of “at least 70 percent” of eligible voters. Contradicting the rival faction, on January 27, Rouhani referred to systematic rigging in the election. “In any case, we could not make the election electronic… What is this, someone writes on a ballot, then drops it in a box, someone reads it, another person marks a ledger, it is not known what is read and what is marked. Then after we have recorded all [the ballots], at the very end, when they want to compile all the votes, what kind of funny business will take place… Many elections run into problems during compilation of the ballots.” Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, the President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), described the aggravating crisis and schism at the top of the regime over the election charade a manifest reflection of another deadly impasse the regime is facing. She said, the complete purge of the rival faction’s candidates is a clear sign of the ruling religious fascism’s inevitable retrenchment in the face of the surging uprisings and the crisis of overthrow. Mrs. Rajavi emphasized that the Iranian people have cast their true vote in the November 2019 and January 2020 uprisings with chants of “death to the principle of the velayat-e faqih, and death to Khamenei.” They will boycott the mullahs’ illegitimate election more than before. Boycotting this farce is a patriotic duty and the Iranian nation’s pledge to the martyrs of the Iranian people, especially the 1,500 martyrs of the November uprising. It also reflects the demands of the January 2020 uprising of the people and students for the overthrow of the illegitimate ruling theocracy in its entirety. The people and students chanted “death to Khamenei, death to the dictator, death to the principle of the velayat-e faqih, death to the oppressor, be it the shah or the leader,” demonstrating that they want a future devoid of shah and the mullahs, and one based on democracy and people’s sovereignty. https://twitter.com/Maryam_Rajavi/status/1225160037502521346 Secretariat of the National Council of Resistance of Iran February 5, 2020

Iranians would choose the Islamic Republic as they did in 1979 if given a choice today, claimed President Hassan Rouhani in a speech on the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. February 11 marks the 41st anniversary of the 1979 revolution which led the current regime to power. Advertisement “If Iranians were to be given a choice today, they would choose the Islamic Republic again just like they did 41 years ago,” Rouhani said on Tuesday in Tehran. “The Islamic revolution was based on a choice, the people chose a religious and democratic regime over a US-dependent and corrupt one,” he said. “Iranians have a choice every year on the anniversary of the revolution to either stay at home or come to the street and pledge allegiance to the regime, and every year, they choose the latter,” Rouhani said. State TV reported that tens of thousands of Iranians had poured into the streets of Tehran and other cities on Tuesday morning to commemorate the 41st anniversary of the Islamic revolution, against a backdrop of escalating tensions with the United States. However, dissidents rejected the claims as overstated and posted videos of empty streets online. Feb 11 - Tehran, #Iran Jomhouri (Republic) Avenue While regime officials are claiming a "million man march" marking the 1979 revolution, video shows merely a few dozen people in the street.#41YearsOfFailure pic.twitter.com/NQlzwFgWEd — Heshmat Alavi (@HeshmatAlavi) February 11, 2020 Regional impact The Islamic Revolution has not only impacted Iran but the region and the whole world, he said, adding that the US and Israel have been Iran’s “biggest enemies” since the 1979 revolution. “America’s mistake is that it thinks it is up against a regime or some politicians, when in reality it is up against 83 million Iranians,” said the Iranian President. Iran almost got into a full-blown conflict with the United States last month after a US drone strike killed top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on January 3, prompting Iran to retaliate with a missile barrage against a US base in Iraq days later. Rouhani thanked the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) for targeting US bases in Iraq last month, claiming that the attacks were demanded by the Iranian people. “I thank the IRGC, the armed forces, and the Basij for listening to the people’s demands and avenging martyr Soleimani by attacking the Ain al-Assad base,” he said. Rouhani described the slain military commander as “a senior and powerful diplomat as well as a military commander,” saying: “Both resistance and diplomacy are required.” “America lies when it says Soleimani was looking for war and instability,” he said, claiming that the former head of the Quds Force brought about stability in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and the whole region. Rouhani also urged Iranians not to boycott the parliamentary elections scheduled for February 21, calling elections the country’s “saviour.” Read also: Timeline: The Iranian revolution and the rise of the Islamic Republic Opinion: Technical setback used to herald 41st anniversary of Islamic Revolution in Iran Fate of jailed Iran protesters remains unknown, families fear death: Report Iran will continue to fund terror abroad despite laundering regulations: Experts

News article:
Rising anti-government fervor, a biting economic crisis, and the absence of free and fair elections are likely to dampen voter turnout in Iran’s upcoming parliamentary elections. Fearing a low turnout in the February 21 vote would harm the legitimacy of the country’s theocratic system, Iranian officials are pulling out all the stops to get the vote out. 'I Beg You' President Hassan Rohani called on voters to get out and vote in the elections despite "possible complaints and criticism.” “I beg you not to be passive,” Rohani, a relative moderate, exhorted the public on February 11. His remarks came after the Guardians Council, which vets all candidates, disqualified some 9,000 of the 14,000 who people who registered to run, including 90 current lawmakers. Iran’s reformists said that 90 percent of its candidates throughout the country have been barred from running. In the 2016 vote, a bloc of reformists and moderate conservatives won 41 percent of the 290 parliamentary seats. Hard-liners won 29 percent and independents took 28 percent. Experts predict hard-liners to dominate the legislature. Ali Rabiei, Rohani's spokesman, offered an even starker message to voters. "The upcoming elections are the most important elections in the history of the Islamic Republic," Rabiei said on February 3. "The only way to prevent the collapse of Iran is by going to the polls." 'Go To Hell' Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called for a high turnout and said voting was an act of patriotism. “Any person who has an affinity for Iran and its security must take part in the elections,” Khamenei said in a speech on February 5. “Someone may not like me personally, but if they love Iran, they must go to the ballot box." “The enemies that threaten the country and the people are more frightened of the public’s support than our military capabilities,” Khamenei added. “Yes, they are scared of our missiles, but they are more frightened of the public’s support. Taking part in the elections is a stamp of support for the system from the people, and it will lead to security.” Public anger has mounted amid a crunching economic crisis that has been fueled by biting U.S. sanctions that were reinstated after President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from the landmark international agreement that curbed Iran’s controversial nuclear program. When officials announced gasoline rationing and price hikes in November 2019, anti-government protests erupted in more than 100 Iranian cities and turned violent before security forces violently put them down amid an Internet blackout. Amnesty International said more than 300 people were killed and thousands detained in the crackdown. In January, Iran shot down a Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) flight after it took off from a Tehran airport, killing all 176 people aboard. Iranian authorities initially denied any responsibility for the accident. But three days after the tragedy the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) admitted the plane had been shot down "unintentionally," leading to days of protests in Iranian cities, with demonstrators chanting slogans against Iran’s clerical leadership. Referring to Khamenei, mourners shouted "death to the dictator." Ali Vaez, the director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group (ICG), said Khamenei’s call for people to come out and vote in elections that were even less free than previous votes shows the “disconnect between the state and the society in Iran.” Ayatollah Ahmad Alamolhoda, a hard-line ally of Khamenei, went further by suggesting that those who stay away from the polls will receive divine punishment. "Those who do not take part in the elections will go to hell," said Alamolhoda. Public Apathy Gauging public opinion is difficult in Iran, where people can be jailed for their opinions. But there are signs of public apathy towards the vote. A poll conducted by the state-run News Network on the Telegram app on February 5 showed over 78 percent of viewers said they would not take part in the elections. Although the posts were deleted, the poll was repeated with similar results. Days later, the posts were deleted again, and a News Network presenter announced that the channel was fake. Analysts said Iranians who would have voted for pro-reform and moderate candidates could decide not to vote, given the mass purge of reformist candidates by officials. With the election results effectively preordained, analysts said it was unclear even if the conservatives and hard-liners could mobilize their supporters. “What this means is that turnout is more important than who takes the majority of seats in parliament,” said Scott Lucas, an Iran expert at Birmingham University in Britain. “Khamenei tipped off that priority last week when he appealed for a high turnout as a message to Iran's enemies,” he added. “The question is to what extent the regime will massage the turnout figures to get the magic number that it wants to declare victory over those enemies -- both at home and abroad.”

News article:
Iran's week-long parliamentary election campaign started on Thursday, state TV reported, a vote seen as a popularity test for the clerical establishment at a time when relations with Washington are at their worst since the 1979 Islamic revolution.The Guardian Council, which must approve candidates, has rejected around 6,850 moderate or conservative hopefuls in favour of hardliners from among the 14,000 applicants seeking to contest the February 21 vote. About a third of lawmakers have also been barred from standing again."The 7,150 candidates who are running for parliamentary elections have started campaigning on Thursday," state TV reported. Pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani has criticised the disqualifications, but like supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei he has called for a high turnout as the country faces challenges over its disputed nuclear programme.Khamenei, the final authority in Iran's complex system of clerical rule and limited democracy, backed the Guardian Council, saying the next parliament was no place for those scared of speaking out against foreign enemies.Tensions with the United States have spiked since 2018, when President Donald Trump withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers and reimposed crippling sanctions.The crisis worsened when Iran's most prominent military commander, Qassem Soleimani, was killed by a US drone in Baghdad in January 3, which led to Iran retaliating against US targets in Iraq on January 8. The vote will have no major influence on foreign affairs or Iran's nuclear policy, which is determined by Khamenei.With the disqualification of moderate and leading conservative figures, hardline loyalists of Khamenei are likely to dominate the parliament.Pro-reform politicians said in January that they had no candidates to stand for 230 of the 290 seats in parliament, saying Iranians' demands for a "free and fair" election were not met because of the large numbers disqualified. The Council has cited various grounds for the rejections, such as "corruption and being unfaithful to Islam".Some 58 million Iranians out of 83 million are eligible to vote. While supporters of the establishment will vote for hardline candidates, moderates are struggling to mobilise their supporters, who are disappointed with Rouhani's failure to ease social and political restrictions.Leading pro-reform parties have been either dismantled or banned since a presidential vote in 2009, in which hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was re-elected. His rivals alleged the vote was rigged.In Tehran, which accounts for 30 seats in the assembly, hardline candidates are headed by Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, a former mayor of the capital who once commanded the elite Revolutionary Guards.

News article:
TEHRAN, Iran (AFP) — Iran’s electoral watchdog on Wednesday defended its decision to disqualify thousands of candidates for a crucial parliamentary election in two days, as a lackluster campaign neared its end. Conservatives are expected to make an overwhelming resurgence in Friday’s vote, which comes after months of steeply escalating tensions between Iran and its decades-old arch foe the United States. Their gains would be made at the expense of those who back President Hassan Rouhani, a relatively moderate conservative who was re-elected in 2017 promising people more freedoms and the benefits of engagement with the West. But many people in Iran feel their lives have been crippled by an economic slump exacerbated by harsh US sanctions since President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a landmark nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic in 2018.

News article:
Iranians are heading to the polls on Friday in a parliamentary election seen as a referendum on the establishment as the country faces growing isolation and threats of conflict over its nuclear standoff with the U.S. amid rising discontent at home. While establishment supporters will vote for hardline candidates, many pro-reform Iranians are furious over the handling of November protests against fuel price hikes that soon turned political, with demonstrators demanding "regime change." Many people on the streets of Tehran have expressed dissatisfaction with politicians ahead of the election, saying they failed to keep their word or to raise living standards. The public is also livid over the accidental downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane in January that killed all 176 people aboard, mainly Iranians. After days of denials, Tehran admitted the Guards were to blame. After the Iranian government raised the fuel prices by 50%, thousands of protesters took to the streets to protest the government. Blocking roads and attempting to prevent the security forces from entering certain neighborhoods, the protesters clashed with the police. Reportedly, the police did not refrain from using live bullets, killing more than 100 people. U.S. sanctions have already deteriorated the economic situation. But Iran's trans-border activities also increase the burden on the country's economy. The vote to pick 290 lawmakers is Iran's first since U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers in 2018, to reimpose sanctions that have hit the economy hard. Turnout was 62% in the 2016 parliamentary vote and 66% of people voted in 2012. About 58 million Iranians are eligible to vote. Conservatives are expected to make an overwhelming resurgence in Friday's vote. Their gains would be made at the expense of those who back President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate conservative who was re-elected in 2017 promising people more freedoms and the benefits of engagement with the West.

On Tuesday, Khamenei said voting was "a religious duty" but some prominent pro-reform politicians in Iran and activists abroad have called for a boycott of the elections. Iranian activists and opposition groups are distributing the Twitter hashtags #BoycottIranShamElections and #VOTENoVote widely on social media.

News article:
An adviser to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is among the regime officials warning that a low turnout in Friday's parliamentary elections will undermine the country's leaders and encourage its enemies to put more pressure on the government. Observers have predicted low turnout among Iranian voters, whether as a protest against the theocratic government or out of indifference. The regime has endured a turbulent year, buffeted by American sanctions following the collapse of the nuclear deal and subsequent economic strain, mass civil unrest subdued by brutal force, and a military stand-off with Washington that resulted in the assassination of Major General Qassem Soleimani and the accidental downing of a passenger plane in which 176 people were killed. But Hesameddin Ashena, a senior adviser to Rouhani, said Wednesday that voters must put aside their anger and vote for the good of the nation. Low turnout, he predicted on Twitter, "will only please Iran's enemies and lead to increased sanctions, an increased probability of military invasion, larger budgets for hired anti-Iranian media, a decline in national resilience and reduced political bargaining power." Iran's reformists currently hold sway in parliament but this week's vote is an opportunity for hardliners to reassert control over the body, which is ultimately falls inline behind the ultra-conservative Guardian Council and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Whichever faction wins Friday's contest will be poised to select the next president when Rouhani's term ends in 2021. Candidates for the parliamentary elections must be vetted and approved by the 12-member Guardian Council, which is composed of six Islamic law experts and six jurists. Of the roughly 16,000 people who applied to be candidates, the council has barred 9,000 from standing. The U.S. on Thursday sanctioned five members of the body for electoral manipulation. Council spokesperson Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei—who was among those sanctioned—said the move was "worthy of the American regime, a regime still plagued by election uncertainties and the crime of assassinating pioneers in the fight against terrorism." He added, "The United States has no right to talk about Iran's senior figures." Khamenei said earlier this week, "Friends and foe are watching out for the election results," seeking to gauge the impact of President Donald Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign against Tehran. He warned it was a national, revolutionary, and religious duty for Iranians to go to the polls. The supreme leader has also dismissed "top-notch fools" abroad who are commenting on the election, suggesting international speculation constitutes attempted interference.

News article:
Iranians went to the polls on Friday to vote for a new parliament. For many of them, it is a chance to hold their lawmakers accountable. The parliament has proven to be powerless in the past few years. Many Iranians chose to abstain from voting in the parliamentary election on Friday. Ahead of the polls, there was a lot of chatter on social media and other platforms about boycotting the election. A survey by the Institute for Social Studies at Tehran University in early February said that not even one out of four Iranians in the capital Tehran would cast their ballot. This is in sharp contrast to the 2016 vote, which recorded a 62% turnout countrywide, and around 50% in Tehran. Mohammad Sadeq Javadi Hesar, who is a member of the reformist Etemad Melli (National Trust Party), anticipated a low turnout this year. "The driving force behind elections in Iran has always been the youth, as well as academics. But now they are disappointed by the government's hollow promises. They are frustrated, especially because they haven't seen a reasonable response to the crises in the past two years," Hesar told DW. Women activists in Iran are also disgruntled. "Whoever goes to the polls will endorse the regime's crimes," 12 women political prisoners at a prison in Tehran wrote in an open letter. These activists called for an election boycott to protest against the regime's brutal handling of demonstrators. Iranian voters skeptical To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Disillusionment with reformists Iranians have experienced a difficult time in the past two years. Last year, US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the international nuclear deal with Iran. New US sanctions and Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran followed, which resulted in an economic crisis in the Middle Eastern country. However, the measures failed to force Tehran to agree to a new, comprehensive nuclear agreement. Read more: Iran seeks compromise from Europe on nuclear deal Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to adopt a policy of "maximum resistance" against the US. Experts say that Iran's strategy to counter American pressure requires total obedience and support from Iranians, but it does not give them any economic respite. The economic crisis has snowballed into a national crisis. When people started protesting against the crisis, Iranian security forces unleashed a brutal crackdown on them. Protesters were targeted by paramilitary forces – under Khamenei's supervision – as the authorities shut down the internet. The aim was to stop news and photos of the government's brutal clampdown from spreading. The internet shutdown was administered by a young minister of communications. The parliamentarians remained silent spectators during this painful time. This made clear to many Iranians that when it comes to suppressing critical voices, there is hardly any difference between hardliners, moderates and reformers.

Protests in Iran after downing of Ukrainian plane To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The regime needs legitimacy After the US killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in early 2020, Iran carried out a retaliatory strike on US bases in Iraq. Two Iranian missiles accidentally hit an Ukrainian passenger plane near Tehran, killing all 176 people onboard, including 146 Iranians. To date, Iranian lawmakers have not dared to question the Revolutionary Guards, whose units were in charge of the missile attack. "The Iranian people feel that the elected institutions have no power," Sadegh Zibakalam, a Tehran-based political scientist, told DW. "All important decisions are made somewhere else." The conflict with the US has strengthened Khamenei, who is not answerable to any institution and has the final say in the country. "Many voters are now wondering why they should vote at all. These disappointed voters are the ones who were once mobilized by reformist parties," underlined Zibakalam. "But there are people in Iran who are loyal to the political system and always go to the polls. They vote for the conservative candidates," he added.

Analysts say a high turnout is crucial for Khamenei as the regime wants to interpret it as a sign of trust in the political system. Nonetheless, Iran's parliamentary elections are far from democratic. The Guardian Council - which comprises the regime's loyalists, religious and legal scholars - already barred almost 9,000 candidates from participating in the polls. Among these are 92 incumbent members of parliament, most of them well-known reformist politicians. Over 7,000 candidates were allowed to take part in the elections by the regime. Many of these are young and inexperienced candidates with one trait in common: their absolute loyalty to Khamenei.

News article:
DUBAI (Reuters) — Iranians began voting on Friday in a parliamentary election likely to help religious rulers tighten their grip on power as the country faces mounting U.S. pressure over its nuclear program and growing discontent at home. With thousands of potential candidates disqualified in favor of hardliners loyal to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the vote is not expected to influence the country’s fraught relationship with the United States. Even though the parliament does not wield significant power, gains by security hawks could weaken pragmatists and conservatives who back the ruling theocracy but support more engagement with the outside world. More hardline seats in the Assembly may also help them in the 2021 contest for president, a job with wide day-to-day control of government. Washington’s withdrawal in 2018 from Iran‘s nuclear deal with world powers, and its reimposition of crippling sanctions, have hurt pragmatists who supported the pact. Tensions between Iran and the United States have increased dramatically since a U.S. drone strike killed the country’s most prominent military commander, Qassem Soleimani, at the Baghdad airport on Jan. 3. Iran retaliated on Jan. 8 by attacking U.S. targets in Iraq with domestically built ballistic missiles, killing no one but causing brain injuries in more than 100 soldiers. State media said voting is set to run for 10 hours, with about 58 million Iranians eligible to vote for the representatives in the 290-member parliament. The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on the members of the Guardian Council and its Elections Supervision Committee over the candidate bans. On Friday Iran‘s election vetting body spokesman said he was honored to be blacklisted by the United States, according to state news agency IRIB. Khamenei was the first to cast his vote. “Voting is a religious duty … which will also guarantee the national interests of Iran,” Khamenei said after he voted, broadcast live on state media. “I am urging Iranians to vote early.” With Iran facing growing isolation on the global stage and discontent at home over economic hardships, analysts have said the election was a referendum on the leaders’ handling of political and economic crises. For Khamenei, a big turnout would signal to arch-foe Washington that Iran is unbowed by sanctions and the killing of Soleimani. The Guardian Council has ensured that hardliners dominate the field, removing 6,850 moderates and leading conservatives and permitting voters a choice mostly between hardline and low-key conservative candidates loyal to Khamenei. The authorities have been under pressure since last year when protests over a fuel price hike were met with the bloodiest crackdown since the 1979 Islamic revolution, killing hundreds. But reformers have failed to capitalize on the unrest. State media showed people waiting to vote in polling stations across the country. “Each vote put into the ballot box, is a missile into the heart of America,” said Amirali Hajizadeh, head of the aerospace unit of Iran‘s elite Revolutionary Guards.

The vote followed the barring of 9,000 mostly reformist and moderate candidates. Authorities said there was large fall in turnout compared to 2016. Hardliners loyal to Iran's supreme leader looked set to sweep to a parliamentary election victory on Friday, likely cementing their grip on power. Iranians voted in parliamentary elections that were seen as unlikely to change approaches to domestic or foreign policy. Thousands of mostly moderate and reformist candidates were barred from the contest. The disqualification of those potential candidates, along with weariness over social restrictions and economic woes, were cited as a reasons for the low voter turnout. Iranian authorities suggested a turnout of about 50%, compared to 62% and 66% respectively in the 2016 and 2012 elections. 'Hardly any voters' Earlier in the day, DW's Theresa Tropper was at a polling station in northern Tehran Friday morning and reported "hardly any voters."

News article:
Iranians lined up at polling stations across the country on Friday to cast their ballot in parliamentary elections. Much hinges on voter turnout, which will be a key gauge of support for Iran’s leadership in a climate of rising tension as the country buckles under a deepening economic crisis and escalating tensions with the United States. Hardliners are expected to tighten their grip in an election following the disqualification of thousands candidates in favour of those loyal to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Prior to the vote, his allies in The Guardian Council, a hardline vetting body, weeded out moderates and leading conservatives, leaving a pool of candidates loyal to the supreme leader. In response, the Trump administration sanctioned five Iranian officials who it accused of preventing free and fair elections on Thursday evening. “Literally, it is not a race anymore. Hardliners want the presidency. This is the end of moderation for at least a decade if not more,” an official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. While the Iranian Parliament does not wield major power, significant gains by regime supporters could weaken the country’s pragmatist politicians, who back wider engagement with the outside world. The outcome is likely to weaken the position of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who has disappointed supporters by failing to follow through on promises to ease social and political restrictions. The reformist president, who won the last two elections on promises to open Iran up to the outside world, has already lost credibility over the outcome of the nuclear deal, which he orchestrated with the US. Conservatives, who support the ruling theocracy, will likely dominate, but a win could be undermined by mass abstention if voters boycott the polls. In the days leading up to the vote, Iran's leaders pumped out messages of encouragement at rallies and on social media, urging supporters to cast their ballot. "Voting is a religious duty ... which will also guarantee the national interests of Iran," Mr Khamenei said after he voted on state television. "I am urging Iranians to vote early." ss Some 58 million Iranians out of 83 million are eligible to vote in Iran, where leaders have drawn legitimacy from high voter turnouts in the past. For Mr Khameini, a big turnout would send a strong signal to Washington that that Iran can survive US sanctions. Tensions between the US and Iran have been rising since President Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal in 2018 and peaked in recent weeks after a US drone strike killed the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force commander Qassem Suleimani on January 3. Critics of the regime said a low turnout would express the public's anger over economic hardship and the violent repression of human rights. Crowds surged onto the streets last November after a steep increase in fuel prices prompted mass protests that quickly morphed into demonstrations calling for regime change. During a week-long internet blackout, a brutal government crackdown killed hundreds and led to thousands of arrests. Many Iranians are also furious over the accidental shooting down of a Ukrainian passenger plane in January that killed all 176 on board. Protests in the wake of the incident, which Tehran spent several days denying before admitting responsibility, reiterated demands for an end to the regime. Anti-establishment Iranians have tweeted support for a boycott of the elections on social media with posts showing fingerprints dipped in red ink to represent those killed in the fuel protests under the hashtags #RedInkBoycott and #ElectionBoycott2020. Previous elections in 2012 and 2016 saw 66-per cent and 62-per cent turnouts respectively with some commentators predicting that disillusionment over the state of the economy and the failure of President Rouhani to follow through on promises to improve civil liberties will lead to a lower turnout in this election. But with no independent, reliable opinion polls in Iran, it’s difficult to predict which way the ballot will go.

News article:
TEHRAN: Conservatives took an early lead on Saturday as the first results of Iran’s parliamentary election came in, boosted by a predicted low turnout following the disqualification of nearly half the candidates. Friday’s election followed months of steeply escalating tensions between Iran and the US. Voters had been widely expected to shun the polls, disillusioned by unfulfilled promises and struggling to cope in a country whose economy has buckled under harsh US sanctions. About half of the 16,000-odd candidates were disqualified. Among them were many reformist and moderate candidates — including dozens of sitting MPs — leaving conservatives with virtually no competition. By midday on Saturday, votes had been counted in 71 constituencies out of 208, according to National Elections Committee figures reported by semi-official news agency ISNA. Tehran is the biggest catch in the election with 30 seats. The conservative and ultra-conservative alliance appeared to have a comfortable edge in the capital in early results, the committee’s spokesman Esmail Mousavi said on state television. Most votes went to the first three names on the alliance’s list, he said. Opinion This section contains relevant reference points, placed in (Opinion field) Leading the race was Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, a three-time presidential candidate, former police chief and member of the Revolutionary Guards who was Tehran mayor from 2005 to 2017. Reformists and moderates hardly figured in the 37 other names of “leading Tehran candidates,” Mousavi said. Final results for both the capital and other provinces would be announced by early Sunday at the latest, he added. If the results are confirmed, it will mean President Hassan Rouhani’s slender majority of reformists and moderates elected with fanfare four years ago is nearly purged. “A lot of people voted in the previous parliamentary election, but the enthusiasm faded away every day after that,” Ali, a Tehran taxi driver, told AFP. “And now there’s nothing to be hopeful about to go and vote,” added the 53-year-old, who abstained. HIGH LIGHTS • About half of the 16,000-odd candidates were disqualified. • Tehran is the biggest catch in the election with 30 seats. • Final results for both the capital and other provinces will be announced by early Sunday. • The 11th parliamentary election since the 1979 revolution comes after a surge in tensions between Tehran and Washington. • Leading the race was Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, a three-time presidential candidate, former police chief and member of the Revolutionary Guards who was Tehran mayor from 2005 to 2017. With official figures still coming in, news agencies close to conservatives and ultra-conservatives have predicted a landslide win for their candidates across Iran. An unofficial tally published by Fars news agency said 183 of Parliament’s 290 seats had already been decided, with conservative candidates winning 135 of them. Reformists were a distant second at 20, it said, adding independents had won 28 seats. Fars tweeted that turnout in Tehran was 1.9 million out of more than 9 million eligible voters. Many in the capital seem to have sat out the election, including Arghavan Aram, who manages an NGO for transsexuals. “An election with only one faction is not an election, it’s a selection,” she said. But Aram appeared optimistic for a future where “Trump leaves, Democrats come to power alongside a moderate supreme leader” in Iran and things would change. The state television website said that among 56 winners announced on Saturday, most were fresh faces and only 10 were former MPs. The 11th parliamentary election since the 1979 revolution comes after a surge in tensions between Tehran and Washington, and Iran’s accidental downing of a Ukrainian airliner that sparked anti-government protests. Turnout was estimated at around 40 percent nationwide and 30 percent in Tehran at the scheduled close of polls on Friday, according to Fars. But authorities extended polling for another six hours to allow as many people as possible to vote. Fars said the official turnout figure would be released on Saturday, while official results are not expected to be announced until Sunday. Schools were closed in dozens of urban centers on Saturday while the count went ahead. Iran fell into a deep recession after US President Donald Trump reimposed sanctions following Washington’s unilateral withdrawal from a landmark nuclear deal in 2018.

News article:
Hardliners in Iran have secured all 30 parliamentary seats in Tehran, the country's capital, state TV reported on Sunday. These were the initial results of its first round of parliamentary elections, which were held on Friday and were expected to produce victory for the country's conservatives. Early indications from Tehran and other provinces show the principlist and conservative factions were set for a landslide win in the 290-seat Parliament. The result would be a blow to moderate conservative President Hassan Rouhani. Conservatives won 191 of the Parliament's 290 seats, Fars news agency reported. Reformists were a distant second at 16, it said, adding independents had won 34 seats. Iran's Interior Minister, Abdolreza Fazli, said on Sunday that turnout in the parliamentary election was about 42 per cent, state TV reported. That was the lowest since Iran's 1979 revolution. Mr Fazli said more than 24 million of 58 million eligible voters took part in the election on Friday. He said the lowest turnout from the vote was the capital, Tehran, with just 25.4 per cent. Mr Fazli said the country voted under less than ideal circumstances but: "We believe that the number of votes and the turnout is absolutely acceptable." The turnout is widely regarded as a measure of how Iranians view the country's government and signals possible widespread dissatisfaction with Iran's rulers and the system over which they preside. Turnout was nearly 62 per cent in the 2016 elections and has consistently been above 50 per cent since the revolution. The strong victory for principlists and conservatives may be due to the Guardian Council, a vetting body of six clerics appointed by Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and six jurists, which disqualified more than half of the 14,000 people who applied to be candidates. Most of those rejected by the council came were reformists and the moderates. This led the factions to boycott the elections in Tehran. Mr Rouhani criticised the Guardian Council, saying "this is not an election” in a televised speech on January 15. He still urged Iranians to vote. In the 2016 election, the reformists bloc and their centrist and moderate allies won 41 per cent of parliamentary seats. The principlists won 29 per cent and independents took 28 per cent of seats. The result was a setback for the conservative bloc. This parliamentary election was also supposed to enable a review of Iran's Constitution to pave the way for a smooth succession for Mr Khamenei, while he is still in good health to supervise the transition. The elections took place under the threat of the coronavirus, which has killed eight people in Iran and infected 43 people across five cities, including Tehran. Iran reported its first case of the virus two days before the national polls. Mr Khamenei on Sunday accused enemy "propaganda" of trying to dissuade people from voting by exaggerating the threat of the coronavirus. "Their media did not ignore the tiniest opportunity for discouraging people and resorting to the pretext of diseases and the virus," he said. A range of crises has beset Iran in the past year, including widespread anti-government protests in November sparked by a rise in prices. They hurt the establishment's legitimacy after they were met with a violent crackdown that deepened resentment over economic hardship and corruption. There were also protests after the accidental downing of a passenger jet by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps amid heightened tensions with the US in January. Authorities initially tried to cover up the cause of the crash. The withdrawal by the US in 2018 from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, and its reimposition of sanctions, have hit Iran's economy hard. On the eve of the vote in Iran, the Trump administration sanctioned five election officials and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticised the election as a "sham".

Iran's hardliners took victory today in a general election marred by the lowest turnout since the 1979 Islamic Revolution amid anger at the government. Tehran, which reported its first case of coronavirus two days before Friday's ballot, accused 'enemies' of fuelling fears of the deadly contagion to stifle voting. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said: 'Their media did not ignore the tiniest opportunity for discouraging people and resorting to the pretext of diseases and the virus.' However, experts had anticipated low turnout amid growing anger at the government over biting economic conditions, made worse by conflict with the US, and the conservative authorities' barring more than half the 16,000 candidates. Iranians queue to vote in the parliamentary elections in a polling station on Friday in the capital Tehran Iranian President Hassan Rouhani casts his ballot for the 11th Parliamentary elections at a polling station in Tehran, Iran on polling day It signals a shift from four years ago when moderates and reformists won a slender majority in parliament and heaps further pressure on President Hassan Rouhani. The interior ministry announced results of 95 percent of the 208 constituencies in Friday's election, declaring the names of the winning candidates but without specifying their political affiliation. 'Victory for the anti-American candidates, a new slap for Trump,' crowed the ultra-conservative Kayhan newspaper. 'The people have disqualified the reformists,' it added, alluding to Rouhani's backers, who have been weakened by President Donald Trump pulling the US out of a landmark nuclear deal and by a slew of economic and political crises. Seventeen women were elected, the website of the government newspaper Iran said - the same number as in the outgoing 290-seat parliament. Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli announced the participation rate was 42.6 percent - the lowest in four decades. The election came two days after Iran announced its first cases of the deadly new coronavirus that emerged in China. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei speaks on the coronavirus cases and last week's elections in Tehran on Sunday. 'Their media did not ignore the tiniest opportunity for discouraging people and resorting to the pretext of diseases and the virus.' He said Poll workers empty full ballot boxes after the parliamentary election voting time ended in Tehran in the early hours of Saturday 'We held these elections when there were various incidents in the country: we had bad weather, there was this coronavirus disease, there was the plane crash,' Rahmani Fazli said, referring to the January 3 downing of a Ukrainian airliner which killed 176 people. He said that in such a scenario 'the turnout rate seems perfectly acceptable for us.' A low participation had been widely forecast, as a conservative-dominated electoral watchdog disqualified about half of the 16,000-odd candidates, mostly moderates and reformists. The Fars news agency said a second round would be held in at least 11 constituencies. One woman candidate has qualified for the second round, Iran newspaper added. Voter apathy marked the polls, but Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei lauded the people's 'huge participation' despite what he termed 'negative propaganda' by foreign media. It 'began a few months ago and grew larger approaching the election and in the past two days, under the pretext of this illness,' he said. 'Their media did not miss the slightest opportunity to discourage people from voting. (Our enemies) are even opposed to any election by the Iranian people,' the leader added. Iran on Sunday reported three new coronavirus deaths, taking its toll to eight - the highest in any country outside China. It said there were 43 COVID-19 virus infections nationwide.

Art events, concerts and film shows have been banned for a week across the country. In the past 24 hours, four new infections surfaced in Tehran, seven in the holy city of Qom - where the country's first infections emerged - two in Gilan and one each in Markazi and Tonekabon, health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said. 'We are on the frontlines, we need help,' said the head of Qom's medical sciences university, Mohammadreza Ghadir. 'If I can say one thing, it is help Qom.' Iran's health minister, Saeed Namaki, said the treatment of COVID-19 cases would be free. 'In every city, one hospital will be dedicated to treating coronavirus cases,' he said, adding that this number would be greater in bigger cities like the capital. Tehran's city hall has ordered the closure of snack shops and water fountains in metro stations, officials said. Iranians queue up to vote during parliamentary elections at the Shah Abdul Azim shrine in southern Tehran Tehran municipality spokesman Gholamreza Mohammadi said buses and underground trains were being disinfected. Mohsen Hashemi, head of Tehran's municipal council, said, 'If the number of infections increases in Tehran, the whole city will be quarantined.' Posters were also put up across the sprawling city of eight million on Sunday, asking people not to shake hands as part of a coronavirus prevention campaign. Iran's cyberpolice meanwhile warned that anyone putting 'fake clips' online related to the virus would be punished. The World Health Organization has expressed concern over the speed at which COVID-19 has spread in Iran, as well as it being exported from the Islamic republic to other countries, including Lebanon.

News article:
Iran last week held parliamentary elections amid growing anti-regime protests, U.S. threats and an increasing death toll from the coronavirus. Voter turnout slumped to its lowest since 1979, when the current regime, under the leadership of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, seized power after the ousting of the country's last Shah, Reza Pahlavi. Turnout dwindled to 42.5%, indicating that the brutally suppressed protests had manifested themselves into an unofficial boycott of the elections after various reformist figures had been banned from running in the elections. Iran’s conservatives declared victory on Sunday evening after winning all 30 of the government. Conservative newspapers hailed the results as a victory against the U.S., with which tensions are at an all-time high after the killing of Qassem Soleimani last month in Iraq. In fact, Iranian people are wary of the ongoing tensions with the U.S., Israel and the involvement of their country in the wars and conflicts in the Middle East, from Yemen to Syria. During the protests in the last few months, demonstrators chanted slogans against the regime’s foreign policy and called for change, only to be brutally suppressed. Although it is impossible to authenticate the numbers, it is estimated that thousands of people were killed by security forces. The brutal crackdown was followed by the barring of more than 7,000, mostly moderate and reformist potential candidates. At least 90 of the disqualified potential candidates were already lawmakers. The low turnout seems to mark a silent protest against the regime, although Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli said: “We held these elections when there were various incidents in the country. We had bad weather, there was the coronavirus and there was the plane crash,” referring to the downing of the Ukrainian jet by an Iranian missile that killed 176 people. While Fazli found the turnout “acceptable under these circumstances,” the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, accused the foreign media of carrying out negative propaganda. He said it “began a few months ago and grew larger with the approaching election and in the past two days, under the pretext of this illness. Their media did not miss the slightest opportunity to discourage people from voting. (Our enemies) are even opposed to an election by the Iranian people.” President Hassan Rouhani, who is under mounting pressure due to the conservatives outbreak, criticized the disqualification of potential candidates by the Guardian Council, which acts under the supreme leader’s command. “The disqualification was akin to customers being told they have options but being offered just one brand at a store.” In fact, in previous elections in 2016, turnout came to nearly 62% and led to reformists securing a considerable number of seats in Parliament. Amid increased tensions with the U.S., the victory of the conservatives is likely to lead Iran to adopt a harshened rhetoric, to be unwilling to compromise with the U.S. and to enact stricter measures against regime dissidents. The conservatives in Tehran were led by Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, former head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ air force wing. He is expected to become speaker of the incoming Parliament. His victory will strengthen the Revolutionary Guards’ position in the country. The Iranian regime may also impose more rigid measures against its people, who refused to cast a ballot in light of repressive measures. The regime will likely harshen its tone against the U.S. and Israel which will only cause further destabilization in the Middle East.

News article:
After Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to annex the Jordan Valley along with all of the Israeli settlements in the West Bank if he wins the upcoming elections, Defense Minister Naftali Bennett on Wednesday pushed for a cabinet vote to move ahead with the plan already next week. In a Twitter exchange the previous day between Netanyahu and his chief rival, Blue and White leader MK Benny Gantz, the two men appeared to dare each other to swiftly apply sovereignty over the Jordan Valley. The annexation talk is “welcome,” Bennett wrote on Twitter “but it is, for the time being, just talk. The only real test is action.” He called on Netanyahu to bring the annexation measure for approval by the cabinet at its coming weekly meeting on Sunday, followed by a vote in the Knesset on Tuesday. “Only actions will determine,” wrote Bennett, who leads the Yamina alliance of nationalist parties to the right of Likud. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Yisrael Beytenu leader MK Avigdor Liberman, a fierce rival of Netanyahu, criticized the prime minister’s announcement the night before, accusing him of simply trying to divert attention from his efforts to seek parliamentary immunity from an indictment in three corruption cases. “You don’t care one whit about the Jordan Valley,” Liberman wrote Wednesday on Facebook. “The only thing you care about is immunity.” Like Bennett, he called on Netanyahu to show his sincerity by immediately working to pass annexation legislation. Advertisement Shas leader Aryeh Deri on Wednesday said in a statement that his party would support such a bill and urged others to also support it, as “a historic opportunity has been created.” He said Shas was calling on “all the parties to join the process, in order to ensure broad national agreement that will send a message to the world that the Israeli people are united on this important matter.” Netanyahu’s annexation promise in a speech Tuesday launching his Likud party’s election campaign came hours after Gantz promised to apply Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley. In what appeared to be the top centrist lawmaker’s latest effort to cater to right-leaning voters, Gantz said the area making up roughly 20 percent of the West Bank would remain part of the Jewish state in any future peace agreement. Currently, the only way for Israel to annex to Jordan Valley with the agreement of the international community would be under a negotiated peace deal with the Palestinians, who claim the entire West Bank for a future state. Right-wing officials and settler leaders largely scoffed at Gantz’s pledge. Netanyahu called the Blue and White leader’s bluff by urging him not to wait until after the election, but rather to support the measure if it is brought before the Knesset for a vote in the coming weeks. Advertisement Gantz subsequently issued a similar challenge to Netanyahu, tweeting: “You can apply Israeli law in the Jordan Valley in a cabinet decision within two hours, without any Knesset discussion. Let’s see you.” Netanyahu continued the exchange of jabs, tweeting: “I expect full support by you and Blue and White for this historic move. Very soon I will put you to that test.” After that exchange, Transportation Minister Bezalel Smotrich urged Netanyahu to call a Knesset vote as early as next week to immediately annex the Jordan Valley, a call echoed by Bennett on Wednesday. Hebrew media widely reported Netanyahu’s possible move as a potential trap for Blue and White, since if it supports the measure the party will be seen as being steered by the premier on major policy issues, and if it opposes it that would put the lie to Gantz’s Tuesday annexation announcement. However, a decision to extend Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley during a transitional government is likely to be opposed by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who reportedly voiced reservations when the issue was raised ahead of the September elections. Elections in April and September failed to break a political deadlock and produce a permanent government, sending Israel to an unprecedented third vote on March 2. A key campaign issue is Netanyahu’s immunity bid, the process for which has been hampered by the political stalemate. Netanyahu — who faces an indictment on corruption charges, including bribery, in three cases — denies any wrongdoing. Opposition lawmakers are striving to see the immunity request debated before the coming election because there is currently a majority in parliament opposed to granting it. Jacob Magid and Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Tuesday to annex all settlements in the occupied West Bank as he officially launched his election campaign, reported The Times of Israel. The Likud leader made the remarks on the same day that his main rival Benny Gantz had promised to annex the Jordan Valley region of the occupied West Bank. Speaking to supporters in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said his government would "immediately" extend Israeli sovereignty over all West Bank settlements "without exception". Netanyahu also attacked the Blue and White leader, suggesting that the former military chief's commitment to annexing the Jordan Valley was an election campaign bluff. READ: 'I won't let settlements be uprooted in any diplomatic plan', says Netanyahu Urging Gantz to back a potential vote coming before the Knesset in the coming weeks, spearheaded by transportation minister Bezalel Smotrich, to approve the annexation of the Jordan Valley, Netanyahu declared: "Benny Gantz, I expect an answer by the end of the day". The party leaders than exchanged tweets, with Gantz telling Netanyahu: "Try for once not to lie and here's a tip — you can apply Israeli law in the Jordan Valley in a cabinet decision within two hours, without any Knesset discussion. Let's see you". Netanyahu replied: "Benny Gantz, I am happy you have finally decided to support my initiative to apply Israeli law in the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea. I expect full support from you and Blue and White for this historic move. Very soon I will put you to that test". OPINION: More war crimes are Israel's plan for the immediate future According to The Times of Israel, "Netanyahu is reportedly considering the move [to hold a vote] as a trap for Blue and White, since if it supports the measure the party will be seen as being dragged by the premier on major policy issues, and if it opposes it that would negate the effect of Tuesday's annexation announcement". The report also noted, however, that a decision to annex the region "during a transitional government is likely to be opposed by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who reportedly voiced reservations when the issue was raised ahead of the September elections".

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday vowed to annex not only the Jordan Valley if he wins the upcoming elections, but also all the Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The comments in a speech launching his Likud party’s election campaign, came hours after Netanyahu’s main rival, centrist leader Benny Gantz, promised to apply Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley. Addressing a mostly young crowd of enthusiastic supporters at Jerusalem’s International Convention Center, Netanyahu said his government would “immediately” extend Israeli sovereignty over all West Bank settlements “without exception.” He repeatedly denounced Gantz’s Blue and White party as “left-wing,” seeking to counter Gantz’s vow earlier Tuesday to annex the Jordan Valley “in coordination with the international community” if he wins the upcoming election. In what appeared to be the top centrist lawmaker’s latest effort to cater to right-leaning voters, Gantz, during a visit to what he referred to as “Israel’s eastern protective wall,” said the area making up roughly 20 percent of the West Bank would remain part of the Jewish state in any future peace agreement and that previous governments which had been willing to negotiate over the strategic region had been mistaken. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Gantz’s statement was criticized by some within Blue and White. On Tuesday evening Gantz sought to slightly walk back his statement, telling his party’s lawmakers in a WhatsApp group: “Go back and listen carefully to my words, they have nothing to do with unilateral annexation.” The only way for Israel to annex to Jordan Valley with the agreement of the international community would be under a negotiated peace deal with the Palestinians, who claim the entire West Bank for a future state. Right-wing officials and settler leaders largely scoffed at Gantz’s pledge.

However, a decision to extend Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley during a transitional government is likely to be opposed by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who reportedly voiced reservations when the issue was raised ahead of the September elections. The premier also acknowledged at the time that for a transitional government to carry out such a move would be legally problematic. Ahead of the previous election, he vowed to immediately annex the Jordan Valley if he were to win. However, the results led to an extension of the deadlock that has now paralyzed Israeli politics for over a year and neither he nor Gantz were able to form a government that would have been able to carry out the controversial move. Advertisement The Blue and White leader has long asserted that he opposes any unilateral solutions to the conflict, and given that annexation would be a nonstarter for the Palestinian leadership (and could also risk ending Israel’s diplomatic ties with Egypt and Jordan), such a move would almost certainly fail to receive bilateral support.

News article:
Defense Minister Naftali Bennet said Sunday that Israel will in "under no condition allow for the establishment of a Palestinian state," ahead of the Trump administration's release of the long-awaited Middle East peace plan, slated to be unveiled on Tuesday. Speaking in the West Bank settlement of Ariel, Bennett said: "In no case, under no condition, will we allow for the establishment of a Palestinian state or recognition of such a state and we will not relinquish a single centimeter of the land of Israel to Arabs." Haaretz Weekly Ep. 58 Credit: Haaretz >> Read more: Annexation for dummies: Making sense of Netanyahu and Gantz's declarations "Before us, before the government, is a once in a lifetime chance, once in 50 years, to extend Israeli law over half a million citizens and over the Jordan Valley and Gush Etzion," Bennett said. Both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main rival, Kahol Lavan leader Benny Gantz, set out to Washington on Sunday to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan. "This has been our dream for so many years. They're asking what position we will take," Bennett said. "Our answer: Annexation – we support the plan. No annexation – we won't support the plan." The defense minister called to extend Israeli law over all of the West Bank and added: "The right-wing government won't allow debate with the left over any option other than the full extension of Israeli sovereignty over half a million Israelis at this Sunday's security cabinet meeting. Open gallery view "In another week here, the city of Ariel will able to finally be an official part of the state, just like Tel Aviv. If that happens, the cabinet will fully support the 'deal of the century.'" According to Israeli sources, the American plan will assure full Israeli sovereignty in all the existing settlements and annexation of the Jordan Valley, which will become Israel's eastern border. Responsibility for security in all the territory in the West Bank and most of Jerusalem – including the Old City – is expected to remain in Israeli hands. In addition, Israel won't be able to expand the settlements and will be forced to clear illegal outposts. According to the sources, the Palestinian state will be established over most of the land in the West Bank and in outlying Palestinian neighborhoods of Jerusalem. In addition, a future Palestinian state would retain access to and take part in the management of the holy sites, in coordination with Jordan. Earlier Sunday, Netanyahu departed for the U.S. and is expected to land in Washington in the early morning hours on Monday. Before departing, Netanyahu said: "Five years ago I appeared before Congress in Washington because I had to stand up to a plan developed by an American president," referencing the Iran nuclear deal signed between former President Barack Obama and Tehran. "I've believed that plan jeopardized Israel's mere existence. Today I'm headed to bring back a plan, which I believe will advance Israel's interests. On Tuesday we'll make History," the premier continued. Netanyahu was originally scheduled to meet with Trump on Tuesday. However, after it was announced that Gantz would hold a private meeting with the U.S. president on Monday, a senior Israeli official said the premier would also sit down with Trump on Monday in addition to their audience the day after. Meanwhile, Yossi Dagan, the head of the Samaria Regional Council in the West Bank, will also take off Sunday to take part in a series of meetings with evangelical Christians and Republicans in a bid to gain their support against giving away territory meant for a future Palestinian state. On Saturday night, the Samaria Regional Council launched a campaign featuring its stance on Trump's peace plan. According to the campaign, the council "rules out the establishment of a Palestinian state, will not agree to abandon isolated Jewish communities as enclaves in a territory controlled by a terrorist country, and rejects renouncing Area C and B and further concessions." The Oslo Accords divided the West Bank into three parts: Area A, which makes up 18 percent of the West Bank and includes all large Palestinian cities, is under full control of the Palestinian Authority; Area B, which makes up 22 percent, is under civilian control of the PA and Israeli security control; and Area C, which makes up 60 percent, is controlled by Israel and is home to Palestinian communities alongside Israeli settlements.

Defense Minister Naftali Bennet said Sunday that Israel will in "under no condition allow for the establishment of a Palestinian state," ahead of the Trump administration's release of the long-awaited Middle East peace plan, slated to be unveiled on Tuesday. Speaking in the West Bank settlement of Ariel, Bennett said: "In no case, under no condition, will we allow for the establishment of a Palestinian state or recognition of such a state and we will not relinquish a single centimeter of the land of Israel to Arabs." Haaretz Weekly Ep. 58 Credit: Haaretz >> Read more: Annexation for dummies: Making sense of Netanyahu and Gantz's declarations "Before us, before the government, is a once in a lifetime chance, once in 50 years, to extend Israeli law over half a million citizens and over the Jordan Valley and Gush Etzion," Bennett said. Both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main rival, Kahol Lavan leader Benny Gantz, set out to Washington on Sunday to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan. "This has been our dream for so many years. They're asking what position we will take," Bennett said. "Our answer: Annexation – we support the plan. No annexation – we won't support the plan." The defense minister called to extend Israeli law over all of the West Bank and added: "The right-wing government won't allow debate with the left over any option other than the full extension of Israeli sovereignty over half a million Israelis at this Sunday's security cabinet meeting. Open gallery view "In another week here, the city of Ariel will able to finally be an official part of the state, just like Tel Aviv. If that happens, the cabinet will fully support the 'deal of the century.'" According to Israeli sources, the American plan will assure full Israeli sovereignty in all the existing settlements and annexation of the Jordan Valley, which will become Israel's eastern border. Responsibility for security in all the territory in the West Bank and most of Jerusalem – including the Old City – is expected to remain in Israeli hands. In addition, Israel won't be able to expand the settlements and will be forced to clear illegal outposts. According to the sources, the Palestinian state will be established over most of the land in the West Bank and in outlying Palestinian neighborhoods of Jerusalem. In addition, a future Palestinian state would retain access to and take part in the management of the holy sites, in coordination with Jordan. Earlier Sunday, Netanyahu departed for the U.S. and is expected to land in Washington in the early morning hours on Monday. Before departing, Netanyahu said: "Five years ago I appeared before Congress in Washington because I had to stand up to a plan developed by an American president," referencing the Iran nuclear deal signed between former President Barack Obama and Tehran. "I've believed that plan jeopardized Israel's mere existence. Today I'm headed to bring back a plan, which I believe will advance Israel's interests. On Tuesday we'll make History," the premier continued. Netanyahu was originally scheduled to meet with Trump on Tuesday. However, after it was announced that Gantz would hold a private meeting with the U.S. president on Monday, a senior Israeli official said the premier would also sit down with Trump on Monday in addition to their audience the day after. Meanwhile, Yossi Dagan, the head of the Samaria Regional Council in the West Bank, will also take off Sunday to take part in a series of meetings with evangelical Christians and Republicans in a bid to gain their support against giving away territory meant for a future Palestinian state. On Saturday night, the Samaria Regional Council launched a campaign featuring its stance on Trump's peace plan. According to the campaign, the council "rules out the establishment of a Palestinian state, will not agree to abandon isolated Jewish communities as enclaves in a territory controlled by a terrorist country, and rejects renouncing Area C and B and further concessions."

News article:
By Dov Benovadia YERUSHALAYIM — The Interior Ministry is working on solutions for issues that will arise in the event that Israel annexes areas of Yehudah and Shomron, Interior Minister Rabbi Aryeh Deri said Monday. On a tour of the Jordan Valley – the first time since 1994 that a member of Shas has officially toured the region, Channel 13 reported – Deri said that declaring sovereignty over areas like the Jordan Valley “is a mitzvah that has come to our hands, and we are not allowed to miss the opportunity to miss doing a mitzvah.” On the tour, Rabbi Deri met with local officials and visited farms and some of the small communities that dot the area, as well as conferring with IDF officials. “Our forefathers were here, this marks the spot where the Jews entered Eretz Yisrael, and this is where the great return by our people to their land began,” Rabbi Deri said. “This is our land and the land of our forefathers. We have already begun working on installing Israeli law here. The mayors here will be mayors not by order of the military government, but by the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry. Israeli diplomats who have been involved in discussions regarding the plan say that Israel is not going to be required to make many more concessions than it has already made. Channel 12 said that the plan includes recognition of Yerushalayim as Israel’s capital, and gives the option for Israeli sovereignty on all the settlement blocs, at the very least. The plan does not call for the establishment of a Palestinian state at this time, but reserves the option for one to be established in the future – if the Palestinians accept the conditions of the plan, which almost undoubtedly will include recognizing Israel as a Jewish state, something the Palestinian Authority has refused to do until now. Details on President Donald Trump’s “deal of the century” peace plan are expected to be released Monday. Both Binyamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz will meet with Trump Monday afternoon Israel time, with the prime minister conferring with the president before the Blue and White head. Afterwards, details of the plan will be released. Netanyahu will again meet with Trump Tuesday at noon, Washington time.

Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennet sounded a defiant note yesterday ahead of the expected publication this week of the Trump administration's peace plan for the region, reported Haaretz. In no case, under no condition, will we allow for the establishment of a Palestinian state or recognition of such a state and we will not relinquish a single centimetre of the land of Israel to Arabs said Bennett, speaking in Ariel, a major settlement in the occupied West Bank. The minister additionally clarified that "under no condition" will Israel "allow for the establishment of a Palestinian state". Reports suggest that the White House will unveil the political contours of its plan tomorrow, with both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition leader Benny Gantz both in Washington to hold talks with President Donald Trump. "Before us, before the government, is a once in a lifetime chance, once in 50 years, to extend Israeli law over half a million citizens and over the Jordan Valley and Gush Etzion," declared Bennett. READ: No opposition from the international community as Israel alters the two-state paradigm "This has been our dream for so many years. They're asking what position we will take," he added. "Our answer: Annexation – we support the plan. No annexation – we won't support the plan." Bennett, a long-term proponent of unilateral annexation of portions of the occupied West Bank, called for the Israeli authorities to take action. "In another week here, the city of Ariel will able to finally be an official part of the state, just like Tel Aviv," he said. "If that happens, the cabinet will fully support the 'deal of the century'." The minister's remarks came as Netanyahu departed for the US, telling reporters as he left: "Five years ago I appeared before Congress in Washington because I had to stand up to a plan developed by an American president," referring to Barack Obama's nuclear deal with Iran.

News article:
Israeli hardliners called on the government to immediately annex all Israeli settlements after the US published its long-awaited peace plan, while several left-wing politicians warned that the plan could lead to a form of “apartheid” control over the Palestinians. Trump’s plan calls for the creation of a Palestinian state with its capital in portions of East Jerusalem, but also allows for Israel to hold on to large chunks of the West Bank, including the Jordan Valley and where settlements are located. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would begin working to annex areas okayed as Israeli under the plan as early as next week, despite only controlling a caretaker government that is generally restricted from making wide-ranging moves. Responding to the plan, the centrist Blue and White party said that the proposal “is entirely consistent with the principles of state and security espoused by Blue and White.” Trump said Tuesday that party leader Benny Gantz, whom he met with a day earlier, had endorsed the plan as a basis for talks with the Palestinians. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “President Trump’s peace plan provides a strong, viable basis for advancing a peace accord with the Palestinians, while preserving the existing arrangements between Israel and Jordan and Egypt, and enabling their expansion to additional countries in the region,” the party said in a statement. However, a party official told The Times of Israel that it would not support any implementation of the plan before March’s election. In its statement, the party noted that Netanyahu had been officially indicted in three separate corruption cases only hours earlier, saying he thus could not implement the plan. Advertisement Defense Minister and Yamina chairman Naftali Bennett called to immediately carry out annexation without hesitation. “History is knocking at the door. Now, the battle moves from the White House in Washington to the cabinet room in Jerusalem — not postponing after the elections, and not settling for partial sovereignty — take everything, and now,” Bennett said in a video released shortly after Trump and Netanyahu’s statements in the White House. According to Bennett, “The president told us tonight: ‘The decision is in your hands — apply Israeli law to all of Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] immediately, now, in the next few days, and we the US will recognize sovereignty immediately.'” But Bennett also warned: “To be clear, we will not allow the Israeli government to recognize a Palestinian state under any circumstances. We will not allow Israel to deliver an inch of land to the Arabs. That’s what we’re here for, guarding the Land of Israel.” Netanyahu had touted the plan as “good for Israel and good for peace,” though it includes the creation of a Palestinian state opposed by much of his right-wing base. He promised to abide by the Trump plan, including its stipulation that Israel not build in areas designated for a future Palestinian state under the scheme. Transportation Minister Bezalel Smotrich, chair of the National Union faction within Yamina, also called for immediate annexation, saying, “Dare to win. We will continue to dare and with God’s help win more and more.” Advertisement But, like Bennett, Smotrich also said he would oppose any Palestinian state. “We continue to oppose any kind of Arab sovereignty in the Land of Israel. We do not accept the American program but take the good parts of it,” he said. Shas leader Aryeh Deri released a statement praising the plan and saying that his ultra-Orthodox party would support “the immediate application of sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and the territories of Judea and Samaria at the upcoming government meeting, as approved by the US government this evening.” Saying that, “The right of the people of Israel to it’s land was given historic recognition tonight,” the Shas leader added that “the historic opportunity [to annex parts of the Biblical land of Israel] must not be missed and must not be rejected.” Amir Peretz, leader of the center-left Labor-Gesher-Meretz union, said Israel’s future must be decided in direct negotiations with the Palestinian Authority, and not via unilateral steps. “We will determine our fate ourselves by direct negotiations with the Palestinian Authority, which will conclude with an agreement that will secure a Jewish and democratic state within safe borders for future generations,” he said. Peretz added that the timing weeks before a national election means “there is no legitimacy for the government to carry out diplomatic moves, despite American backing, and must be dealt with after the election.” MKs from the predominately Israeli Arab Joint List trashed the peace plan as a step towards potential apartheid rule. Advertisement “Like the separation policy in the southern US, apartheid, the Vietnam War and countless other stains on human history, the occupation will also end and the Palestinian people will live in an independent state alongside the State of Israel,” said Joint List chair Ayman Odeh in a tweet. “In the end, the just demand for equality and peace will overcome the surrender to supremacy and war.” He also released a statement decrying a section of the plan that opens the possibility of transferring areas of northern Israel where Arab citizens live to Palestinian control. “This is the inevitable end point of Trump and Bibi’s racist agenda: a green light to revoke the citizenship of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arab citizens who live in northern Israel,” he said, using a nickname for Netanyahu. But Yisrael Beytenu leader Avigdor Liberman, who has described Israeli Arabs as a fifth column and has called in the past for giving some Arab towns to a future Palestinian state, said he was happy to see that his idea was adopted in the plan. Joint List MK Yousef Jabareen said in a statement that, “The American deal cannot be a ‘peace plan’ because it perpetuates the occupation of Palestinian lands and ignores the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people for self-determination. Thus, the plan will continue to perpetuate the conflict.” “We in the Joint List call upon international community to reject this plan and to continue to support the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state according to the 1967 borders with its capital in East Jerusalem and removal of the all settlements – which continue to be defined as war crimes according to international law,” Jabareen said. “Importantly, by accepting a state according to the 1967 border, Palestinians will be left with only 22% of the land of historical Palestine. This is an extremely painful compromise; Palestinians should not be required to accept additional compromises.”

* Hawk bids for right-wing vote ahead of Israeli election * Palestinians say Trump gave green light for annexation * Trump plan proposes two-state solution, with conditionsKushner says won't chase Palestinian leadership (adds Palestinian, Kushner quotes) By Stephen Farrell and Ari Rabinovitch JERUSALEM, Jan 29 (Reuters) - A leading government hawk called on Wednesday for Israel to establish sovereignty over nearly a third of the occupied West Bank, hours after U.S. Donald Trump announced a Middle East peace plan that Palestinians said amounted to apartheid. The remarks by Naftali Bennett, a coalition partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government, led Palestinians to say Trump's plan had given the "green light" for Israel to formally annex its settlements in the West Bank that it has occupied since the 1967 Middle East War. Trump's plan envisages a two-state solution with Israel and a future Palestinian state living alongside each other, but with strict conditions that Palestinians have baulked at. He proposed a four-year schedule for the creation of a Palestinian state, with Palestinians first having to agree to halt attacks by the Islamist militant group Hamas which controls the enclave of Gaza. But the plan also gave U.S. recognition of Israel's West Bank settlements - deemed illegal under international law - Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley, and a redrawn, demilitarised Palestinian state that would meet Israel's security requirements. Jerusalem would be the undivided capital of Israel, it said. ELECTION JOSTLING With Netanyahu still outside Israel after attending the plan's presentation in Washington, Bennett outlined his hardline interpretation of what the White House had offered Israel. "Last night history knocked on the door of our home and gave us a one-time opportunity to apply Israeli law on all settlements in Samaria, Judea, the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea," Bennett said, using the Hebrew names for areas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He had ordered a team to be set up to apply Israeli law and sovereignty on all Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Bennett is vying with Netanyahu for support from right-wing voters in an election set for March 2. It is unclear whether the present caretaker administration has a legal mandate to carry out such a move after two inconclusive elections in 2019. Netanyahu on Wednesday reiterated his support for Trump's plan, telling Fox television: "We will not contradict in any way the outline that the president put forward." But Amir Peretz, head of Israel's left-wing Labor Party, said no unilateral plan could work. "Now more than ever it's clear that we need a diplomatic compass," he said. SLAP OF THE CENTURY Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called Trump's plan the "slap of the century" after it was announced. Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said on Wednesday Trump's team had simply "copied and pasted" the blueprint that Netanyahu and Israeli settler leaders wanted to see implemented. "It's about annexation, it's about apartheid," he said in Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. "Moving to the de jure annexation of settlements is something that was given the green light yesterday." Palestinians also dismissed the proposal for a capital in Abu Dis, in the West Bank just outside the Israeli municipal borders of Jerusalems. It lies a mile east of the historic walled Old City, home to sites sacred to Judaism, Christianity and Islam but cut off by an Israeli wall and checkpoints. Palestinian leaders believe the Trump administration is biased towards Israel. Before announcing the much-touted plan, it had broken from international consensus by recognising disputed Jerusalem as Israel's capital, halted aid to the Palestinians, and said it no longer considered the settlements a breach of international law. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and the plan's principal architect, shrugged off the Palestinian rejection. "We're not going to chase the Palestinians...the Palestinian leadership, you can't really treat them like they're a serious government, or capable or competent dealmakers," he told reporters. "They'll do what they've always done, which is screw everything up." The Palestinians could push for a U.N. condemnation of the plan. Israel's U.N. mission signaled on Tuesday it would work to thwart this in a diplomatic campaign with the United States. PALESTINIAN STATE Gaza political analyst Talal Okal said the deal gave Israel the right to take what it wanted "immediately, while the Palestinians have to wait four years to see whether they have rights or not". Amos Yadlin, a former Israeli head of military intelligence said: "This is the most favorable plan for Israel ever presented by an international player." However he said that because it included mention of a two-state solution, it could still cause problems for Netanyahu among his right-wing allies. Bennett seemed to confirm this. "The Israeli government will not recognise a Palestinian state," he said (Additional reporting by Ali Sawafta in Ramallah, Nidal al-Mughrabi in Gaza and Ari Rabinovitch and Rami Ayyub in Jerusalem and Michelle Nichols in New York, Editing by Angus MacSwan) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

News article:
With the release of US President Donald Trump’s long-awaited plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and senior members of the Israeli government called for the immediate annexation of the Jordan Valley and Jewish settlements in the West Bank. In the following hours, however, lawmakers began walking back those calls somewhat as Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said he had to review the move as it may contradict the widely accepted view that caretaker governments are not meant to take such dramatic policy steps. The United States has also appeared to call for Israel to not begin the annexation process immediately, but to coordinate such a move through an as-yet-to-be-created joint committee. There is no concrete legal proscription that explicitly forbids the government’s annexation plans, but there are historical precedents against such a move. In cases concerning the powers of transitional governments, the High Court of Justice has maintained that these caretaker administrations are meant to strike a balance “between restraint and action.” This is seen as especially true for the current government, which did not win majority support in the last election and thus does not truly represent the democratic will of the people. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The Court has ruled that while there are no formal limits on an interim government’s powers, it should only take actions beyond the public need “in cases in which an ‘essential public need’ demands immediate action and cannot be delayed until after the elections,” according to legal scholars Amichai Cohen and Amir Fuchs of the Israel Democracy Institute. An example of this would be the Israeli airstrike on the Iraqi nuclear reactor in 1981, three weeks before parliamentary elections, which represented a significant military operation that had the potential to spark a war but had clear defense value. One of the more direct parallels to the current situation occurred in 2000, when Ehud Barak, who had recently dissolved his government, attempted to enter negotiations with Palestinian leader Yassar Arafat. A petition was filed to block the move, arguing that Barak was overstepping his bounds as an interim prime minister. The Court, under Justice Aharon Barak, rejected the appeal, allowing the prime minister to continue negotiations. Advertisement In that case, however, Ehud Barak’s attorney general told the Court that he would bring any proposed peace agreement to a vote in the Knesset before passage. Ultimately, the matter was for nought as the peace talks failed, with Arafat rejecting Barak’s offer. Now, the government may attempt to argue that there is a pressing need to act quickly in order to annex the Jordan Valley and Jewish settlements in the West Bank, as US support may waver on the matter or other external factors may prevent Israel from going forward with the plan in the future. If accepted, this could lead to the somewhat bizarre situation in which the current government is legally unable to easily perform simple budgetary actions like subsidize afternoon preschools or provide start-up grants to Israeli technology companies, but could radically alter the dynamics in the West Bank with a unilateral annexation. Though this is not necessarily a winning argument. According to Cohen and Fuchs, “it is unlikely that a government decision to carry out an annexation will be approved by the Supreme Court.” In his comments on the matter, Mandelblit was more circumspect. Advertisement “If a request is filed, I will examine it from a legal perspective. I don’t rule out anything. I will hear what the request is and what the explanation is for the urgency, and I will decide on that basis,” said Mandelblit on Tuesday, who earlier in the day filed an indictment against Netanyahu with the Jerusalem District Court in three corruption cases after the premier withdrew his request for immunity from prosecution. Of course, even if Mandelblit approves the annexation, the matter would almost certainly be challenged in court and could be blocked there. In order to avoid such an argument, the government could try a different tack: bringing the matter to a vote in the Knesset. Though formally disbanded, the parliament could be brought in to vote on annexation if it gets approval from the Arrangements Committee, which is responsible for procedural matters of the Knesset. If such a proposition were passed in the Knesset — a possibility but by no means a certainty — there would be no real legal recourse to prevent annexation.

News article:
Defense Minister Naftali Bennett on Wednesday announced that he had established a special team to lead the effort to annex West Bank Jewish settlements, the Jordan Valley and the area around the Dead Sea, following the release of US President Donald Trump’s plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Bennett called for the interim government to begin annexing parts of the West Bank immediately, before the March 2 elections, despite the apparent contradiction with the widely accepted legal view that caretaker governments are not meant to make such dramatic policy steps. On Tuesday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would bring a vote on annexing Israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley to the cabinet on Sunday, though in the hours since then, other members of his party have walked back the timing of the vote, saying it would likely be delayed, in order to allow Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit sufficient time to weigh in on the matter. “Last night, people around the prime minister announced that the decision on sovereignty [over the Jordan Valley and settlements] would come to a vote on Sunday. This morning we’re hearing a different tune,” Bennett said, speaking at the annual conference of the Institute for National Security Studies think tank in Tel Aviv. The defense minister, who is head of the Yamina bloc of religious right-wing parties, said he would “not miss this opportunity” to annex portions of the West Bank. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “I will be clear: Whatever is postponed until after the elections will never happen. We all understand this,” Bennett said. “Therefore, I am announcing this morning that I ordered the formation of a special team to apply and carry out the implementation of Israeli law and sovereignty over all Jewish settlements in Judea and Samara, over the Jordan Valley, and the hotels around the Dead Sea,” he said, using the biblical term for the West Bank. The defense minister said the team would consist of representatives from the Israel Defense Forces, the Defense Ministry, various government offices and other security services. Advertisement On Sunday, the Defense Ministry refused to comment on whether it was making preparations for annexations in the West Bank, saying that the matter was “too political” to discuss given the upcoming election. Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, who is one of the plan’s architects, told CNN in an interview on Tuesday that he did not believe Israel would approve the annexations on Sunday, “at least not as far as I know.” Mandelblit said Tuesday night that he could rule in favor of a transitional government approving an annexation. “My point of view is that I need to help the government implement its policy and that has rules — restraint must be maintained during a transitional government,” said Mandelblit, who earlier in the day filed an indictment against Netanyahu with the Jerusalem District Court in three corruption cases after the premier withdrew his request for immunity from prosecution. “If a request is filed, I will examine it from a legal perspective,” he added. “I don’t rule out anything. I will hear what the request is and what the explanation is for the urgency, and I will decide on that basis.” The Ynet news site cited an unsourced estimation that Mandelblit would likely say the annexation was legal, but point out legal difficulties in making such a dramatic decision. It quoted a decision from almost 20 years ago, when attorney general Elyakim Rubinstein told prime minister Ehud Barak that there was no legal impediment to holding negotiations with the Palestinians during a transitional government, but that the timing was nevertheless inappropriate. Advertisement Former justice minister Ayelet Shaked, also a member of Bennett’s Yamina, said Wednesday, in an interview with Army Radio, that “Mandelblit will not block a historic move, such as applying [Israeli] sovereignty in Judea and Samaria. “All the restrictions on transitional governments have descended from court rulings that began 20 years ago and reins placed by legal advisers. It has no anchoring in the law,” she added. Netanyahu told reporters in Washington that the US had agreed to Israel’s immediate annexation of “additional areas” of the West Bank that are adjacent to the settlements. However, he said that Israel will not apply sovereignty immediately, but during a second phase, at a yet-undetermined time. “We need to do some work to define exactly [what we will annex],” he said. Netanyahu’s main rival, Benny Gantz’s Blue and White party, has said it would only support implementing the contours of the plan after the March 2 election. Breaking with past US administrations, the plan envisions the creation of a Palestinian state in part of the West Bank, a handful of neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and some areas of southern Israel — on condition that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state and Hamas and other terror groups in the Gaza Strip disarm. The plan also calls for allowing Israel to annex settlements, granting the Jewish state sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and ongoing overall security control west of the Jordan River, and barring Palestinians from entering Israel as refugees.

News article:
JERUSALEM: Questions surfaced Thursday over whether Israel would immediately seek to annex parts of the West Bank, after US President Donald Trump’s controversial peace plan called for extending Israeli sovereignty to the area. The plan, seen as overwhelmingly supportive of Israeli goals, has been firmly rejected by the Palestinians. It gives the Jewish state a US green light to annex key parts of the occupied West Bank, including in the strategic Jordan Valley. But uncertainty was mounting over Israel’s next moves. After Trump unveiled his long-awaited plan in Washington on Tuesday, his ambassador to Israel David Friedman said the Jewish state “does not have to wait at all. Israeli officials then said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a staunch Trump ally, would seek cabinet approval on Sunday to annex settlements and territory that would be part of Israel under the US plan. But Jared Kushner — Trump’s adviser and son-in-law who spearheaded the Middle East initiative — said that Washington does not want any moves made before Israel’s March 2 election. Asked about the timing of any annexations in an interview with Gzero media, Kushner said: “The hope is they will wait until after the election. “We’ll start working on the technical stuff now, but I think we’d need an Israeli government in place in order to move forward,” he added. Netanyahu currently heads a caretaker government after his Likud failed to win a majority in two elections over the past year. Likud is again running neck-and-neck in the polls with the centrist Blue and White party led by ex-military chief Benny Gantz and it remains unclear if either bloc will be able to form a government following a new election scheduled for March. The Israeli premier also faces graft charges as he battles for re-election. Netanyahu’s office declined to comment when asked if the annexation issue remained on the agenda for Sunday’s cabinet meeting. The international community views Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank as illegal and an attempt to formally place them under Israeli sovereignty would likely trigger further global uproar. Netanyahu was however facing calls from the Israeli right to act. “Whatever will be delayed until after the election won’t ever happen. Everyone understands that. Every settlement, every yard of land that will be postponed to after the election will remain out (of Israel) for another 50 years,” Defence Minister Naftali Bennett said Wednesday. “If we delay or diminish applying sovereignty, the opportunity of the century will become the miss of the century. Netanyahu was in Moscow on Thursday seeking to broaden international support for Israel’s ambitions. Tourism Minister Yariv Levin, who was travelling with him, told army radio that the government wanted to move on annexation “as quickly as possible in a number of days. At the start of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Netanyahu said Trump’s peace initiative offered “a new and perhaps unique opportunity,” without mentioning annexation. The Russian leader did not mention the peace plan at all in his public remarks. Meanwhile, Israel’s army announced that it had deployed extra troops to the West Bank and Gaza ahead of any further Palestinian demonstrations against the Trump plan. The protests have been relatively muted since the Trump announcement, with only isolated clashes reported. But one rocket was fired from the Hamas-controlled Gaza strip on Wednesday evening. In response, Israeli aircraft struck a “number of Hamas terror targets” in the southern Gaza Strip, the army said. A Israeli military official told AFP the decision to deploy extra troops to the West Bank and the Gaza border was made “to minimise the risk of a flareup.”

News article:
Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) President Morton A. Klein and ZOA Chair Mark Levenson, Esq. on Friday urged Israel to immediately apply Israeli sovereignty to all of Judea and Samaria. In a statement, ZOA wrote: "ZOA President Morton Klein was proud be at the White House ceremony this week with President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister [Binyamin] when they announced the plan to end the Arab/Islamic war against Israel." "Klein and top Christian and Jewish leaders also attended a small meeting at the White House with top Administration officials discussing the plan in greater detail. Shortly after the meeting, Prime Minister Netanyahu announced that Israel would quickly declare its sovereignty over Jewish communities in Judea/Samaria and the Jordan Valley. "The ZOA is disappointed to now read the reports that Israel’s exercise of her lawful sovereignty over Jewish communities in Judea/Samaria and the Jordan Valley, and US recognition of Israel’s sovereignty over these areas, is once again being delayed, until after the March 2, 2020 election; after Israel forms a government (which may take a very long time); after aerial photographs are taken; after a joint US-Israeli committee is formed and discusses various parameters; and after, and after. . . . "There is no reason for additional delay! "Israel has already delayed exercising her lawful sovereignty over Judea-Samaria and the Jordan Valley for over half a century. Almost 53 years have passed since Israel recaptured these lawful, historic, sacred, G-D given, international law approved Jewish lands in a defensive war, ending Jordan’s 19-year illegal occupation of Judea-Samaria. The 450,000 Jewish Israelis living in Judea-Samaria are entitled to have their homes fully integrated into, and recognized as part of the Jewish state. "The fact that Israel’s current interim current government supports exercising sovereignty is sufficient reason to move forward immediately. Last summer, the plan was to exercise sovereignty after the September 2019 election. But here we are again, Israel waiting to exercise Israel’s lawful rights until some indeterminate time after yet another election. And the polls indicate that Israel’s third election, in less than a year, may well result in another deadlock. "As for committees, we’re all familiar with the interminable delays that may be produced by committees. The laudatory and favorable portions of the Trump Peace Plan should not be subjected to such delays. At a very minimum, sovereignty should immediately begin to be implemented in stages." ZOA also quoted the US Treaty Obligation to Recognize Israel’s Sovereignty: "As ZOA has frequently pointed out, the 1924 Anglo-American Convention [Treaty] affirmed the mandate (trusteeship) to 'secure the establishment of the Jewish national home' and 'close settlement by Jews on the land' in the areas that include Judea-Samaria (and Jerusalem and the rest of Israel, etc.)." "The Convention was ratified by the US Senate, and signed by then-President Calvin Coolidge, making it a binding US treaty obligation-to this day! This binding US treaty, which guaranteed the Jewish people's rights, was never lawfully overturned. It follows that the US government is lawfully bound to recognize Israel’s sovereignty, and should do so with no further delay, especially since US leaders this week proclaimed their support for Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and every single Jewish community in Judea Samaria."

News article:
By Dov Benovadia YERUSHALAYIM — After Sunday’s Cabinet meeting was canceled – apparently over disagreements between Israel and the United States over the schedule of annexation of areas of Yehudah and Shomron – a report on Channel 13 said that Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu planned to bring the entire “deal of the century” peace plan to the Cabinet for approval. The hope is that if the plan is adopted, the U.S. will give its blessing to annexation before the March 2 election. Netanyahu had planned to bring the annexation part of the plan to a vote separately from the rest of the plan, which gives Israeli consent to the establishment of a Palestinian state, if the conditions for establishment of that state are fulfilled – including the Palestinians’ recognition of Israel as a Jewish state, and the end of payments by the Palestinian Authority to terrorists and their families. While there is widespread support among the right, and in Yisrael Beytenu, for the annexation part of the plan, the rest of the plan is likely to be less popular. Netanyahu believes that if the Cabinet approves the plan, Washington will relent and allow at least one stage of the annexation to go through. After the momentum achieved at the presentation of the plan last week, Netanyahu is determined to at least begin the annexation process, although it’s highly unlikely that it will be completed before the election. The Yesha Council on Sunday launched an emergency campaign for imposition of sovereignty on areas of Yehudah and Shomron this week, saying that if it is not accomplished now, it will never happen. Naftali Bennett’s Yemina party on Thursday reiterated the need for a quick imposition of Israeli sovereignty on Jewish communities in Yehudah and Shomron – immediately, before the March elections. “Missing this opportunity would be a terrible blow to Jewish settlement, to the half a million Jews in Yehudah, Shomron and the Jordan Valley. Sovereignty is at our fingertips, we dare not miss the opportunity,” the party said in a statement. Meanwhile, Channel 12 said that the head of the CIA, Gina Haspel, has promised Palestinian Authority chief Mahmoud Abbas that her organization would work to prevent any annexation before the election. Haspel urged Abbas not to make any “hasty decisions” regarding the PA’s security cooperation with Israel and the U.S. At a meeting of the Arab League Saturday, Abbas said that the PA “ will not accept this framework under any circumstances, and I say directly that if Israel and the U.S. continue to violate the agreements with us, we will break off relations altogether, including security cooperation.” Over the past two years, the U.S. and the PA have communicated chiefly via the CIA. The PA has refused to meet with American diplomatic staff in the region, as the Authority is boycotting the U.S. administration.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel has begun to draw up maps of land in the occupied West Bank that will be annexed in accordance with U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed peace plan, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday. Slideshow ( 3 images ) “We are already at the height of the process of mapping the area that, according to the Trump plan, will become part of the state of Israel. It won’t take too long,” Netanyahu said at an election campaign rally in the Maale Adumim settlement. Netanyahu said the area would include all Israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley - territory Israel has kept under military occupation since its capture in the 1967 Middle East war but which Palestinians want in a future state. “The only map that can be accepted as the map of Palestine is the map of the Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with Jerusalem as its capital,” said Nabil Abu Rdainah, spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Prospects for annexations, which have already been widely condemned, are unclear. Israel will hold a national election on March 2 and Netanyahu, who is facing criminal corruption charges, is hoping to win a fifth term in office. He presently heads a caretaker government, whose legal authority to annex territory is still undecided by judicial authorities. Settlers make up part of Netanyahu’s right-wing voter base and many members of his coalition cabinet view the West Bank as the biblical heartland of the Jewish people. Most countries consider Israeli settlements on land captured in war to be a violation of international law. Trump has changed U.S. policy to withdraw such objections. Palestinians say the settlements make a future state non-viable. Israel cites security needs as well as biblical and historical ties to the land on which they are built. Trump’s plan envisages a two-state solution with Israel and a future Palestinian state living alongside each other, but it includes strict conditions that Palestinians reject. The blueprint gives Israel much of what it has long sought, including U.S. recognition of settlements and Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley. A redrawn, demilitarized Palestinian state would be subject to Israeli control over its security, and would receive tracts of desert in return for arable land settled by Israelis. Right after Trump presented the plan on Jan. 28, Netanyahu said his government would begin extending Israeli sovereignty to the settlements and the Jordan Valley within days. But Washington then appeared to put the breaks on that and Netanyahu has since faced pressure from settler leaders to annex territory despite any U.S. objections.

Unilateral Israeli steps to annex West Bank land would endanger US support for such plans, America’s Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said on Sunday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said over the weekend that Israel had begun drawing up maps for annexing land in the West Bank, which Palestinians seek for a state, in accordance with US President Donald Trump's proposed peace plan. "President Trump's Vision for Peace is the product of more than three years of close consultations among the President, PM Netanyahu and their respective senior staff," Mr Friedman said on Twitter. "Israel is subject to the completion [of] a mapping process by a joint Israeli-American committee. Any unilateral action in advance of the completion of the committee process endangers the Plan & American recognition," Mr Friedman said. That process will probably not be completed before Israel's March 2 election, Mr Friedman later told reporters in Jerusalem. Right after Mr Trump presented the plan on January 28, Mr Netanyahu said his government would begin extending Israeli sovereignty to the settlements and the Jordan Valley within days. But Washington then appeared to put the brakes on that and Mr Netanyahu has since faced pressure from settler leaders to annex territory despite any US objections. Although Mr Trump's plan envisages a two-state solution with Israel and a future Palestinian state living alongside each other, it includes strict conditions that the Palestinians have rejected out of hand.

Settlers make up part of Mr Netanyahu’s right-wing voter base and many members of his coalition cabinet view the West Bank as the biblical heartland of the Jewish people. As the election nears, pressure has mounted on Mr Netanyahu from settler leaders, and members of his right-wing cabinet with whom he is competing for votes, to move ahead with annexations before the ballot, despite White House calls to hold off. Mr Friedman's remarks appeared to provide Mr Netanyahu with some defence against those pressures. "The [US] recognition is the main thing and we don't want to endanger that," Mr Netanyahu told his cabinet on Sunday. He said the annexed area would include all Israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley – territory Israel has kept under military occupation since its capture in the 1967 Middle East war but which Palestinians want in a future state.

Mr Trump has changed US policy to withdraw such objections and the prospect of Israeli annexations have drawn widespread condemnation. Palestinians say the settlements make a future state unviable.

Prime Minister Netanyahu addresses his push to apply Israeli sovereignty over areas of the West Bank, indicating Israel has independently begun mapping territory while appearing to concede that annexation of these areas can’t move forward without US approval. “In Washington, on my last visit, we made history. We brought an American plan according to which the US will recognize our sovereignty over the Jordan Valley, northern Dead Sea, all the settlements in Judea and Samaria without exception… and a large area enveloping it,” he says at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting. “This requires precise mapping of these areas, the entire territory,” Netanyahu continues. “The work has begun, the Israeli team has already started, the train set out and this work will be completed.” Netanyahu insists the Trump administration will eventually back Israel annexation of these areas, but acknowledges it won’t happen until the mapping process is complete — despite his vow to bring the matter for government approval within days of the Trump plan’s unveiling. “The US and we agreed that when this entire process is completed we’ll bring it to the government [for approval]. But the Americans are saying in the clearest manner: ‘We want to give you recognition and we’ll give you it when the entire process is complete,'” he says. “Recognition is the main thing. We brought this, I brought this,” the premier adds. “We don’t want to endanger this. We are working responsibility and intelligently.” Netanyahu also takes a shot at pro-settlement lawmakers he is allied with who are calling for Israel to annex these areas immediately. “For all the tweeters outside and even inside the government — we did the work, we’ll complete the work and therefore the work has begun and it will be completed, I hope very soon,” he says.

News article:
Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, announced on Sunday that his government is working hard to make the West Bank an integral part of Israel, Shehab News Agency reported. During the weekly meeting of his cabinet, Netanyahu announced the names of the team who started working to draw the new maps of the West Bank and Israeli borders, based on the "Deal of the Century". The team consists of Likud minister, Yariv Levin, in addition to Meir Ben-Shabbat and Ronen Peretz. The team will obtain assistance from the US ambassador in Israel. "This team will achieve sovereignty over the remaining part of our country in the West Bank, Jordan Valley and the north of the Dead Sea," Netanyahu disclosed, noting these areas are "integral parts of the state of Israel".

News article:
HAR HEMED, West Bank (Reuters) - An election in Israel next week could bring many settlers in the occupied West Bank closer to a long-held goal - annexation of the settlements where they live. Daniella Weiss, an Israeli settler leader speaks to Israeli men during her interview with Reuters in the settlement outpost of Har Hemed near the settlement of Kedumim in the Israeli-occupied West Bank February 20, 2020. Picture taken February 20, 2020. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun But for hardline settlers, that prize could come with an unacceptable price - the creation of a Palestinian state. Their dream of consolidating Israel’s hold on the West Bank and their nightmare of giving some of it up are both included in the pages of U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan for the Middle East, announced in January. Fighting for his political survival in Israel’s third election in less than a year, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged, if he wins Monday’s vote, to apply Israeli sovereignty to the settlements, built on land captured in a war in 1967. His frequent campaign stops in settlements and promises of de-facto annexation - which Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said would create a fragmented and unviable “Swiss cheese” of a Palestinian state - could draw votes from the far-right. But Netanyahu’s annexation promises do not go far enough for some settlers. They believe God promised the land to their forefathers and want all the West Bank, for which they use the Biblical name Judea and Samaria, not just the settlements. “Rest assured that we will not stop claiming every single inch of this land when Netanyahu, please God, is elected,” said Daniella Weiss, a settler leader from Kedumim who helped establish the nearby settlement outpost of Har Hemed. The provisions of Trump’s plan will for the first time be a factor for voters as the contents were announced after Israel’s inconclusive elections on April 9 and Sept. 17 last year. The West Bank’s 450,000 settlers, living in more than 250 settlements and outposts among towns where 3 million Palestinians reside, make up only about five percent of Israel’s population. But the settler movement is influential, with a high voter turnout, and is powerful within Netanyahu’s Likud party. Slideshow ( 14 images ) “PIED PIPER” Netanyahu goes on trial on March 17 on corruption charges he denies. But opinion polls show Likud inching past the centrist Blue and White party of former armed forces chief Benny Gantz, though neither is likely to win a solid parliamentary majority. The settlements traditionally vote right-wing, with Likud mainly competing with religious and ultra-religious parties for votes. Every vote could be vital as the last two elections were extremely close -- a single seat in parliament could prove decisive when it comes to coalition-building. Seeking to shore up settler support, Netanyahu has held almost daily events in settlements, including visiting Ariel on Monday with Trump-appointed U.S. Ambassador David Friedman. Still, some settlers are skeptical he will make good on his annexation promise. “He talks about it a lot but something always comes up at the last minute,” said Yoni Novick, from Karnei Shomron settlement. Novick, 43, had come to the settlement’s pub to listen to a leader of Yemina, a far-right party competing with Likud for the settler vote. Asked for whom he would vote, he said: “I really don’t know.” Further south, in Maale Adumim, a settlement of more than 40,000 people about 15 minutes drive from Jerusalem, the red-roofed homes, shopping mall, flowerbeds and traffic make it look like many other Israeli cities. But most of the international community regards it and other settlements as a violation of international law. Israel rejects that view, and is largely backed by the Trump administration. Maale Adumim’s deputy mayor, Guy Yifrach, said he believed there was broad consensus among Israelis that sovereignty should be applied to settlements such as his. He does not believe Gantz would press ahead with annexation if he became prime minister. “The question is who will advance it, and who will drag his heels. If Netanyahu forms the government he will immediately advance it once he gets U.S. permission,” he said. But in Kiryat Arba settlement, settler leader Elyakim Haetzni said anyone supporting Netanyahu was being duped “like the children following the Pied Piper of Hamelin.” “Netanyahu says what is good for him at that moment. He saw that people want sovereignty, so he’s using it as bait. He wants them to bite at it in order to swallow the idea of a Palestinian state,” Haetzni said.

News article:
Israeli premier pledges to annex more lands of West Bank 'within weeks' if re-elected Iran Press TV Sunday, 01 March 2020 3:11 PM In an apparent attempt by Israel's scandal-hit premier to secure votes on the eve of a decisive general election, Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to annex further parts of the occupied West Bank "within weeks" provided that he is re-elected. Netanyahu, Israel's longest serving premier, made the campaign pledge in an interview with the regime's public radio on Sunday, stressing that annexation of the strategically important Jordan Valley and other parts of the West Bank have been his top priority among "four major immediate missions." "That will happen within weeks, two months at the most, I hope," he said, 24 hours before polls were scheduled to open for vote-weary Israelis to cast their ballots for the third time in 12 months. Final polls showed yet another tight competition between Netanyahu-led right-wing Likud party and the centrist Blue and White party, led by ex-military chief Benny Gantz. The incumbent prime minister has already been accused of making last-minute plays to invigorate his right-wing base. However, he has failed to secure enough votes, in the two previous parliamentary elections, to win sufficient seats in the 120-member Knesset and form a majority government. He has also failed so far to form a coalition government. Netanyahu was particularly emboldened in annexing more Palestinian lands by US President Donald Trump in January, when the latter unveiled his much-delayed and self-proclaimed "deal of the century" during an event at the White House alongside the Israeli premier. Palestinian groups have unanimously rejected Trump's one-sided plan, which largely meets Israel's demands in the decades-old conflict with the Palestinians while envisioning a Palestinian state with limited control over its own security and borders. The so-called "peace plan" enshrines Jerusalem al-Quds as "Israel's undivided capital" and allows the regime to annex settlements in the occupied West Bank and the Jordan Valley. The plan also denies the right of return of Palestinian refugees to their homeland, among other controversial terms. Trump's plan has triggered waves of protest rallies both across the Palestinian occupied territories and around the globe. "The joint US-Israeli mapping committee started work a week ago," Netanyahu further said on Sunday, hoping to emerge victorious in Monday's election. However, many fear that the upcoming election fails to break the current political deadlock in the occupying regime and likely turns out to be inconclusive just like the two elections held in April and September, extending a painful political stalemate deep into 2020. Shortly after Netanyahu's pledge on Sunday, former Israeli minister of military affairs Avigdor Lieberman, Netanyahu's ex-ally, publicly lambasted the premier for engaging in empty political rhetoric. Lieberman said that he had "ironclad information" that the Israeli prime minister comments on the Jordan Valley had been at least partly insincere. "A few days ago, it became clear to me that he (Netanyahu) sent a message to (Jordan's) King Abdullah, (saying) 'Don't worry, it's just elections, there will be no annexation of the Jordan Valley'," Lieberman said in a TV interview. Many experts believe that a unilateral move by Netanyahu to annex the valley would definitely trigger further regional tensions and damage ties with neighboring Jordan, one of only two Arab countries that agreed a peace deal with the Israeli regime. On Friday, the European Union's Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell condemned Tel Aviv for its plan to build thousands of settler units in occupied East Jerusalem al-Quds, warning that such construction would sever territorial contiguity between the area and the rest of the occupied West Bank. "The EU reiterates its call on Israel to halt settlement construction, to suspend the publication of tenders and to refrain from any measures aimed at the advancement of such construction plans. Settlements are illegal under international law," Borrell added. His call came three days after Netanyahu announced that he had ordered the promotion of a plan for construction of some 3,500 illegal settler units in the so-called E1 area, which is located between the occupied al-Quds and the Ma'ale Adumim settlement. The move is widely believed to be an obvious attempt aimed at securing votes in the Monday's election. Palestinians want the West Bank as part of a future independent Palestinians state, with East Jerusalem al-Quds as its capital. However, the continued expansion of Israeli settlements is one of the major obstacles to the establishment of peace in the Middle East. The occupying regime seized East Jerusalem al-Quds in the 1967 Six-Day War. It later annexed the territory in a move never recognized by the international community. Around 600,000 Israeli settlers now live in over 230 settlements built in the occupied Palestinian territories of the West Bank and East Jerusalem al-Quds. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has already severed ties between the Palestinian Authority, which he leads, and the Israeli regime as well as the US in reaction to Trump's highly-provocative scheme. Apart from the Palestinian leaders, many other international blocs and organizations, including the European Union, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and the African Union, have rejected Trump's plan.

News article:
ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algerian Foreign Minister Sabri Boukadoum told visiting envoys from other countries neighboring Libya on Thursday that he hoped their meeting would strengthen a fragile truce in the country and help avert more foreign influence there. Slideshow ( 5 images ) “Libya’s neighbors have the responsibility to facilitate a political solution,” he added before the start of his meeting with foreign ministers or other officials from Egypt, Tunisia, Chad, Niger, Sudan and Mali. Heiko Maas, the foreign minister of Germany, which hosted a summit on the Libyan crisis on Sunday, also joined the meeting. The eastern Libyan military commander Khalifa Haftar launched an assault last year with his Libyan National Army (LNA) to capture Tripoli with backing from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Russian mercenaries and African troops. The internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) is backed by Turkey, which has sent military advisers and trainers to help its armed forces ward off Haftar’s attack. In Berlin, foreign powers active in Libya agreed to shore up a shaky ceasefire but the meeting was overshadowed by Haftar’s blockade of energy fields. The conflict’s recent escalation has alarmed some of Libya’s neighbors, who fear it may provide more space for armed militant groups to operate across the Sahara and the Sahel region. “The Sahel is suffering from this crisis. Proliferation of arms in the region has facilitated the spread of terrorism,” said Chad’s Foreign Minister Mahamet Zene Cherif. Tunisia, located between Algeria and Libya, is also concerned about a possible influx of refugees. It was not initially invited to the Berlin summit this month, causing anger among many Tunisian politicians. It turned down a late invitation to attend, saying it had not been given time to prepare.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry lauded on Thursday the outcome of a meeting on Libya, saying all participants rebuffed foreign attempts to meddle with Libya's internal affairs. The meeting today was very positive and comes at an important time in light of the continued armed conflict in Libya and the arrival of many militants in the country, Shoukry told MENA. The situation requires immediate coordination among all Libya's neighbours to help the brotherly country overcome this crisis, he said. All participants rejected foreign interference in Libya's affairs and attempts to bring terrorists or mercenaries to spark military confrontations in the North African country. He said Libya's neighbours should work hard with their Libyan brothers to reach a settlement to the Libyan crisis. He underlined the importance of addressing many issues in Libya, including re-forming the presidential council, re-distributing the country's wealth in a just way, dismantling armed militias and making the national army the only party authorised to protect the country. Shoukry also underlined the importance of fostering cooperation with international partners to settle the Libyan crisis, saying German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas took part in the meeting and expounded efforts to reach a peaceful settlement. About the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, he said technical teams are now meeting in Khartoum to add final touches to a draft deal on rules to fill and operate the dam, expecting it to be finalised today or tomorrow at most. Then, Shoukry said, we will go to the US to reach a final agreement. The $4.6 billion dam on the Blue Nile, which promises to provide much-needed electricity to Ethiopia´s 100 million people, has been a contentious point among the three main Nile Basin countries. Egypt fears that filling the dam’s reservoir too quickly could significantly reduce its share of the Nile water. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Last week an important international meeting was held in Berlin with German Chancellor Angela Merkel's diplomatic efforts. Turkey, Russia, the UAE and Egypt, as well as representatives from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Congo, Algeria, United Nations and African Union, participated in the Berlin conference. From the Libyan side, both the Prime Minister of the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) Fayez al-Sarraj and the head of the Libyan National Army (LNA) renegade Gen. Khalifa Haftar were present at Berlin, but they did not officially join the meeting. The outcome of the Berlin conference did not satisfy any of the parties. The meeting instead appeased instigators like Haftar and the UAE. The message of the conference was: "The Libyan crisis should be resolved by diplomatic means." Turkey's involvement on the side of the GNA changed the balance and pushed forward the possibility of a diplomatic process. Turkish military involvement and Turkey's diplomatic contacts with Russia constrained the expectations of Haftar's forces to take over the capital Tripoli. This balancing acts allowed for the Berlin conference, but the participants of the conference were not committed to stopping Haftar and his supporters' destabilizing efforts in Libya. The cease-fire, arms embargo and the return to the political process among the Libyan actors were the most important highlights of the 55 point conclusions document. It was clear for the analysts of the Libya Conflict that the Berlin conference is stillborn, as it just promised to form a 5+5 Military Committee proposed by the UNSMIL (United Nations Support Mission in Libya). Forming dysfunctional committees that do not have any political power is the most common approach to delay solutions on multilateral platforms. Once again, the Berlin conference demonstrated that multilateral platforms are dysfunctional in finding quick and practical solutions to complicated international conflicts. The inclusion of all the key stakeholders is crucial in reaching a sustainable agreement. This is an important norm that should be one of the fundamental pillars of the conflict management and conflict resolution processes. If the stakeholders do not have particular moral commitments or shared end goals, inclusion can be tricky and counterproductive. Inclusion may provide opportunities for the instigators and may turn them into more influential actors. There was no overarching shared logic or values that the participants agreed upon nor was respect a bottom-line criterion at Berlin. While the Berlin conference was going on, Haftar forces were shelling Tripoli. The UAE and Egypt did not stop their arms shipment to Haftar forces and were unable to invest in a viable military solution. The GNA, Prime Minister al-Sarraj and his supporters felt that they were betrayed in the Berlin meeting. Participants of the Berlin conference failed to force the parties to a permanent cease-fire. They instead requested the cessation of foreign involvement, but for everyone in Berlin, it was clear that the Haftar backers will continue their military support for the LNA. The Turkish side will try to balance the LNA and Haftar's allies until a credible cease-fire is reached. As it was seen in the failed cease-fire efforts in Moscow, Haftar is incapable of making any significant decision by himself. He had to consult with Cairo, Abu Dhabi and some other Western capitals as well. Within this circumstance, if a credible cease-fire cannot be reached any time soon, the Berlin conference may turn into another Geneve process like in the case of the Syrian civil war. Some international actors may be content to see an unstable Libya. As long as the oil flows from the key ports, and there is no significant refugee flow to Europe, international actors are ready to accept the continuation of a prolonged civil war in Libya. Only the Libyans will suffer from such dysfunctional diplomatic efforts. Turkey's involvement and military support for GNA-controlled forces, rather than the U.N. or the EU, are the only hopes of many Libyans in GNA-controlled areas. Only a credible cease-fire that is strictly monitored by a U.N.-recognized body can allow for genuine diplomatic contact between Libyan actors and other key international stakeholders. As the cease-fire gets delayed, the hope for a diplomatic solution to the Libyan crisis diminishes.

News article:
Libya’s National Oil Corporation was not consulted before a deal between the country’s Government of National Accord and Turkey over access to areas potentially rich in natural gas. In early December last year, the GNA and Turkey confirmed a new maritime border deal in the Mediterranean in exchange for military co-operation. Reports later emerged of thousands of Syrian fighters being sent to Libya through Turkey to bolster the security of the GNA in Tripoli. Libya’s dominant state oil company, which has tried to remain independent throughout the country’s civil war, was not involved in the deal between Ankara and Tripoli. But the company intends to play a central role in the development of offshore gas within the country’s maritime borders. The December deal, which would dramatically expand Turkish influence in the region, has been deeply criticised by Libya’s neighbours in the Mediterranean. Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias dismissed it as “ridiculous”, while Egypt called it illegal. This month in Cairo, Egypt, France, Cyprus and Greece condemned the maritime and security agreements while affirming there could be no military solution to the conflict in Libya. The potential foothold gained by Ankara in Libya would infringe on plans by Egypt, Cyprus, Greece and Israel to turn the East Mediterranean into an energy centre after the discovery of massive reserves of natural gas. But the picture for Libya’s oil industry is bleak. After blockades on oilfields in the south of the country, production has fallen to 262,000 barrels per day. Plans to dramatically expand Libya’s production to 1.5 million barrels per day by the end of the year and 2.5 million by 2024 now look most unlikely. Chances of recovery for the Libyan oil sector and the country may lie in upholding the rule of law and for global superpowers to build on last week’s peace conference in Berlin. At the close of the one-day conference in Germany, world powers agreed to enforce the 2011 UN weapons embargo in Libya. The country’s rival leaders, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar and GNA Prime Minister Fayez Al Sarraj, also agreed to send representatives to a military council that would negotiate a ceasefire to end fighting in Tripoli.

The December deal, which would dramatically expand Turkish influence in the region, has been deeply criticised by Libya’s neighbours in the Mediterranean. Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias dismissed it as “ridiculous”, while Egypt called it illegal. This month in Cairo, Egypt, France, Cyprus and Greece condemned the maritime and security agreements while affirming there could be no military solution to the conflict in Libya. The potential foothold gained by Ankara in Libya would infringe on plans by Egypt, Cyprus, Greece and Israel to turn the East Mediterranean into an energy centre after the discovery of massive reserves of natural gas. But the picture for Libya’s oil industry is bleak. After blockades on oilfields in the south of the country, production has fallen to 262,000 barrels per day. Plans to dramatically expand Libya’s production to 1.5 million barrels per day by the end of the year and 2.5 million by 2024 now look most unlikely. Chances of recovery for the Libyan oil sector and the country may lie in upholding the rule of law and for global superpowers to build on last week’s peace conference in Berlin. At the close of the one-day conference in Germany, world powers agreed to enforce the 2011 UN weapons embargo in Libya. The country’s rival leaders, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar and GNA Prime Minister Fayez Al Sarraj, also agreed to send representatives to a military council that would negotiate a ceasefire to end fighting in Tripoli.

News article:
Turkey urged France on Wednesday to stop supporting Libya's eastern-based illegitimate forces and their leader, putschist Gen. Khalifa Haftar. “It is no secret that France has supported warlord Khalifa Haftar since 2011 to have the upper hand over the natural resources of Libya,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said late Wednesday in response to French President Emmanuel Macron’s remarks claiming that Turkey is breaching an agreement to halt foreign interference in the conflict-ravaged north African country. “The French president tried to set his own agenda with his false claims,” the ministry said in the statement. “The main responsibility lies with France in the crisis in Libya, which has been continuing since 2011,” the statement added. “France is one of the countries militarily supporting Haftar, which fights against the legitimate government, the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Libya. His attacks are the main threat to Libya’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” the ministry said. “France should first end its support to Haftar if it wants to contribute to the peace process in Libya,” the statement read, adding, “France, whose dark past in Africa is well known, should undertake a contributing role instead of accusing Turkey.” The statement followed Macron's remarks earlier in the day during a joint news conference with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Macron's comments came a week after the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia – which all back Haftar forces – and Turkey – which backs the legitimate government in Tripoli – agreed with Western powers in Berlin to push for a lasting cease-fire and uphold an arms embargo. However, since then there has been an uptick in fighting with Haftar's forces attempting to open a new front by moving forces toward the city of Misrata in the west of the country. On Jan. 12, the conflict parties announced a cease-fire in response to a joint call by the Turkish and Russian leaders. But the talks for a permanent cease-fire deal ended without an agreement after Haftar left Moscow without signing the deal. Similarly, an attempt of the international community to find a solution to the Libyan crisis in the German capital Berlin on Jan. 19 remained inconclusive, despite Haftar accepting the terms in Berlin to designate members to a U.N.-proposed military commission with five members from each side to monitor the implementation of the cease-fire. Since then, attacks by Haftar’s forces have continued without regard to civilians. The conflict deepened in April last year when Haftar, who controls much of the south and east of Libya, launched an assault to seize capital Tripoli. Since the ousting of late ruler Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, two seats of power have emerged in Libya: one in eastern Libya supported mainly by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, and the other in Tripoli, which enjoys U.N. and international recognition. The U.N.-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) led by Fayez al-Sarraj has been under attack since April by Haftar's forces, with fighting killing over 280 civilians and 2,000 fighters. Ties between Paris and Ankara have become increasingly strained over multiple issues including disagreements over Syria and the Eastern Mediterranean. The Foreign Ministry, in its statement, also touched upon the fact that Macron previously hosted terrorists at Elysee Palace, namely representatives of PKK terror group’s Syrian wing, the YPG. Turkey and Libya also signed a maritime deal two months ago after a meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and GNA Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, in Istanbul. The deal enabled Turkey to secure its rights in the Mediterranean while preventing any fait accompli by other regional states. However, Greece, one of the main regional actors, did not welcome the deal and regarded it as a violation of its rights, though international law says otherwise.

News article:
Artillery exchanges in Tripoli have significantly increased in recent days, causing an increase in civilian casualties due to indiscriminate shelling By Aidan Lewis and Michelle Nichols CAIRO/NEW YORK Jan 30 (Reuters) - The United Nations said on Thursday it was suspending operations at a refugee centre in Libya's capital because it could become a target while the U.N. envoy said a truce brokered by Russia and Turkey was holding "only in name". Artillery exchanges in Tripoli have significantly increased in recent days, U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame told the Security Council in a briefing, causing an increase in civilian casualties due to indiscriminate shelling. Since Jan. 12, when forces aligned with Tripoli's internationally recognised government and eastern based rivals led by Khalifa Haftar conditionally agreed to a truce, more than 110 violations had been recorded, Salame said. Libya's conflict has escalated since Haftar launched an offensive on Tripoli in April, upending U.N.-led peace plans. International powers have supplied arms and air power, though there has been a lull in air strikes since Russia and Turkey called for a truce starting Jan. 12, and international powers met in Berlin on Jan. 19 trying to broker a ceasefire. Haftar has received support from the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Russia and Egypt, while Turkey has recently stepped up its backing for the Tripoli government. U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft told the Security Council that "regrettably the promise of the Berlin conference is already under threat". It was "past time" for those violating an arms embargo "to face real consequences", she warned, without giving details. The 15-member U.N. Security Council has been negotiating a British-drafted resolution to endorse the outcomes of the Berlin conference, but it was not immediately clear when the text could be put to a vote. The U.N. says arms and fighters have continued to pour into Libya despite pledges in Berlin to uphold the arms embargo, while clashes have picked up on the ground with at least 18 civilians killed and three wounded in and around Tripoli since Jan. 6. "With recent developments on the ground, I regret to report that the truce holds only in name," Salame said. MILITARY EXERCISES The closure of the centre for refugees and asylum seekers in central Tripoli may further restrict protection for migrants frequently subjected to abuse including torture and forced labour, both in and out of detention. The UNHCR Gathering and Departure Facility (GDF), which housed nearly 1,000 people, had been plagued with problems, reflecting the difficulties for international agencies working in a city controlled by armed groups. "Unfortunately UNHCR was left with no choice but to suspend work at the (GDF) after learning that training exercises, involving police and military personnel, are taking place just a few metres away from units housing asylum seekers and refugees," Jean-Paul Cavalieri, UNHCR's Libya head, said in a statement. "We fear that the entire area could become a military target, further endangering the lives of refugees, asylum seekers, and other civilians." Libya's western coast has been one of the main departure points for migrants attempting dangerous sea crossings to Europe, though the number of departures has dropped sharply since mid-2017. The country has a migrant population numbering hundreds of thousands, and several thousand are held in detention centres in or near Tripoli that have been left unguarded or hit by artillery or air strikes amid the fighting. In July, an air strike hit a detention centre in Tripoli's Tajoura district that was located in the same complex as an armed group's vehicle repair workshop, killing at least 53 migrants. A U.N. report issued this week repeated previous findings that the air strike was likely carried out by a foreign aircraft, but failed to name the state.

News article:
In the context of the Berlin Process, which has been ongoing since September 2019, the German Government hosted a conference in Berlin on 19 January 2020. The purpose of the conference was to create new political impetus and rally international support for finding a solution to the conflict in Libya. The Berlin Process was designed in support of the tireless efforts of the United Nations, the Secretary-General, António Guterres, and his Special Representative for Libya, Ghassan Salamé, to provide the preconditions for a Libyan-led and Libyan-owned political process that can end the hostilities and bring lasting peace. Together with the Secretary-General and Germany, 11 countries attended the conference: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Italy, the Congo, Turkey and Algeria. The African Union, the Arab League and the European Union also took part. All participants agreed that a political solution to the conflict in Libya is needed. They adopted conclusions to that end and endorsed an operationalization paper by the United Nations Support Mission in Libya to implement the conclusions (see annexes I and II). I should be grateful if the present letter and its annexes could be circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Christoph Heusgen Ambassador Permanent Representative of Germany Annex I to the letter dated 22 January 2020 from the Permanent Representative of Germany to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council The Berlin Conference on Libya 19 January 2020 CONFERENCE CONCLUSIONS 1. Today’s Berlin Conference on Libya, at the invitation of German Chancellor Merkel, has gathered the Governments of Algeria, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey, the Republic of the Congo, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and High Representatives of the United Nations, the African Union, the European Union, and the League of Arab States. 2. We, the participants, note the Co-Chair’s statement on the political, security and humanitarian situation in Libya of the meeting at Foreign Ministers’ level convened by France and Italy on the margins of the 74th General Assembly of the UN in New York on 26 September 2019. 3. We reaffirm our strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national unity of Libya. Only a Libyan-led and Libyan owned political process can end the conflict and bring lasting peace. 4. The conflict in Libya, the instability in the country, the external interferences, the institutional divisions, the proliferation of a vast amount of unchecked weapons and the economy of predation continue to be a threat to international peace and security by providing fertile grounds for traffickers, armed groups and terrorist organizations. It has allowed Al Qaida and ISIS to flourish on the Libyan territory and to launch operations in Libya and in neighboring countries. It has facilitated a destabilizing wave of illegal migration in the region and an important deterioration of the humanitarian situation. We are committed to support Libyans in addressing those structural governance and security issues. 5. The “Berlin Process”, in which we engaged to support the three-point-plan presented by Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (SRSG) Ghassan Salamé to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), has the sole objective of assisting the United Nations in unifying the International Community in their support for a peaceful solution to the Libyan crisis. There can be no military solution in Libya. 6. We commit to refraining from interference in the armed conflict or in the internal affairs of Libya and urge all international actors to do the same. 7. We recognize the central role of the United Nations to facilitate an inclusive intra-Libyan political and reconciliation process, based on the Libyan Political Agreement of 2015 and its institutions, UNSC Resolution 2259 (2015), other relevant UNSC Resolutions and the principles agreed in Paris, Palermo and Abu Dhabi, as well as the important roles of the African Union and its High Level Committee of Heads of State and Government on Libya, the League of Arab States, the European Union and the neighboring countries in Libya’s stabilization with particular regard to intra-Libyan national reconciliation, peace and security and political dialogue. All these International Organisations will closely work together. In this context we welcome the organization by the African Union of the Reconciliation Forum in the spring of 2020. 8. We fully support the good offices and mediation efforts of the United Nations Support Mission to Libya (UNSMIL) and SRSG Salamé. We stress that a durable solution in Libya requires a comprehensive approach that addresses simultaneously the different aspects.

News article:
Cairo - Walid Abdul Rahman Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi called for a “firm stance” by the African Union Peace and Security Summit to confront the continuous dispatch of thousands of foreign fighters and terrorists from Syria to Libya. During his participation in the African Union Peace and Security Summit on Libya and the Sahel, he said the threat of foreign fighters will not be restricted to Libya, but will extend beyond its borders. This would jeopardize the security of neighboring countries, he warned at the summit held in Addis Ababa. Sisi stated that the Libyan crisis was passing through a critical phase that is making it more complicated. This calls for the AU to activate its role, given its responsibility towards maintaining African peace and security, he suggested. The president also considered that the latest negative developments in Libya must not detract from efforts to reach a comprehensive solution to the crisis through addressing its social, economic and political issues, he added. Achieving security stability in Libya hinges on reaching a peaceful settlement to the crisis, stressed Sisi. The settlement must address the marginalization of some regions, fairly distributes wealth, as well as power, and allows the reconstitution of state institutions in Libya and secures the country’s borders.

The settlement must address the marginalization of some regions, fairly distributes wealth, as well as power, and allows the reconstitution of state institutions in Libya and secures the country’s borders.

News article:
EU foreign ministers have agreed on naval and air measures to to try and stop weapon flows to Libya. Critics say it's a toothless deal that will fail to stabilize the country riven by civil war. After intense debate, EU foreign ministers in Brussels agreed Monday to launch a new mission to enforce the weapons embargo against Libya. After meeting his European counterparts, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas announced that a decision had been reached, adding that the new Libya mission would entail a "maritime component," meaning dispatched naval vessels. It will also include aerial and satellite assets. As agreed at the Libya peace conference in Berlin this January, the mission will form one pillar of the EU's revamped overall strategy aimed at stabilizing the North African country. Painstaking diplomatic progress Operation Sophia was suspended last year over Italy's protests that EU vessels were rescuing migrants in distress at sea and allowing them to disembark at Italian ports. More recently, Austria's government opposed restarting a mission, arguing that sending EU ships along the Libyan coast would lead to a rise in Europe-bound migrants. Maas stressed that the new mission would see EU ships dispatched only to the eastern Mediterranean, far away from the sea routes used by migrants, despite the fact that arms smugglers do not stick to observed routes. He reiterated that relaunching the EU mission would help fulfill the Berlin agreement, which envisions separating the warring parties in Libya and ensuring their respective international allies stop supplying arms. Read more: Migration worries shouldn't block EU Libya mission, German foreign minister says More recently, at the weekend's Munich Security Conference, the countries involved in the Libyan conflict once again agreed to honor the arms embargo. Yet UN deputy special envoy for Libya, Stephanie Williams, described the arms embargo as "a joke." "We all really need to step up here. It's complicated because there are violations by land, sea and air, but it needs to be monitored and there needs to be accountability," she said in Munich. Arms by land, sea and air After Libya's long-term ruler Moammar Gadhafi was toppled in 2011, regional militias armed themselves with weapons from Gadhafi's military. With the outbreak of civil war in 2014, arms imports to the country increased significantly. Last year, a bloody proxy war erupted on Libyan soil. Arms deliveries are reaching war-torn Libya by sea, land and air. Rebel warlord Khalifa Haftar, supported through arms deliveries from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, Jordan and Russia, is pitted against the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord led by Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj, which is recognized by the UN and the EU and receives Turkish weapons.

Turkia How much influence does the EU have? EU diplomat-in-chief Borrell said negotiations over the new EU mission had been intense, but enough EU states had ultimately volunteered to send marine vessels. "There will be no shortage" of ships, Borrell said, adding that whenever an EU frigate discovers arms smugglers, it will be able to stop them. However, he admitted this will not be easy. Borrell could not specify how many Libya-bound arms actually arrive in the country by sea. He added that the EU could not be expected to use ground troops to patrol the the Egyptian-Libyan border, through which arms are still delivered. The aerial surveillance component of the EU's operation will only gather intelligence. To actually stop all arms deliveries to Libya, the EU would have to dispatch ground troops and fully control the country's airspace using fighter jets. A recent study from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) found, "There is no easy option for the EU that requires little work and guarantees success in enforce the existing arms embargo. All options have significant political, financial and military costs." The study argued that the EU lacks the military means to make this happen, and that economic sanctions would be key to cutting the arms flow. Maas (center) said it was important that international powers stop supplying sides in the Libyan conflict Image: picture-alliance/AP Photo/F. Seco Not enough, say critics Liberal party members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have reported over 100 recent breaches. They criticize the foreign minsters' agreement for not going far enough. Nicola Beer, an MEP with the business-friendly Free Democrats, said the foreign minsters had wasted an opportunity to "agree on sanctions that would send a clear message to Turkey, Russia or the United Arab Emirates." In her view, a mission without sanctions will not be enough to establish peace in Libya and fight the root causes of migration to Europe. In turn, Green MEPs have complained that the mission does not include migrant sea rescue. MEP Erik Marquardt said, "The vessels should be where people in distress are." He pointed out that over the past year, EU governments have prevented migrants from being rescued and simultaneously helped Libyan militias restrict migration possibilities.

News article:
The Syrian regime of Bashar Assad reopened the Libyan Embassy in Damascus on Tuesday after an eight-year hiatus and handed it over to the illegitimate government of east Libya-based putschist Gen. Khalifa Haftar. The embassy was given to Haftar's government after the two signed a memorandum of understanding to reopen embassies, the official SANA news agency reported. The Syrian regime is the first to officially recognize Haftar's government with the approval of an embassy. Haftar has no other official international recognition, though Egypt, France and the United Arab Emirates have verbally expressed support. Notably, the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA), led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, enjoys U.N. and international recognition. Haftar launched an offensive to capture Tripoli from GNA last April, which led to chaos and bloodshed but stalled on the outskirts of the city.

Several peace activists in the Gaza Strip were arrested on treason charges for allegedly participating in a Zoom video chat with their counterparts in Israel. Palestinian figure Rami Aman and others are being held on holding a "normalization activity with the Israeli occupation," said Eyad al-Bozom, a spokesperson from the interior ministry run by Hamas. ISRAEL TO FACE NATIONWIDE LOCKDOWN DURING PASSOVER, NETANYAHU ANNOUNCES "Holding any activity or contact with the Israeli occupation under any cover is a crime punishable by law and a betrayal for the people and their sacrifices,” he said in a statement. Aman's family said he answered a summons from security forces Thursday and have not heard from him since. The call with Israeli peace activists on Monday lasted for two hours. The participants talked about their daily lives, the COVID-19 pandemic and other issues, the Guardian reported. “In the beginning, it was hard for us to work in a place like Gaza. We have no electricity, nothing to do, unemployment, and with everyone outside Gaza looking at us like we are terrorists," Aman said on the call. “The new virus is a new addition to other viruses – the blockade, unemployment, cancer, pollution, electricity. We already have a lot of viruses," he added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Hamas took over the Gaza Strip from the Palestinian forces in 2007 and does not recognize Israel. The group is designated a terrorist group by the United States and Israel for carrying out deadly attacks on Israelis. Hamas and Israel have engaged in talks to end the hostilities via Egypt and with mediators with the United Nations in exchange. The group is asking for Israel to soften its blockade imposed on Gaza.

As people around the world mark Palestinian Prisoners' Day, author Ramzy Baroud has said it is not just those who are in Israeli prisoners who are detained, "all Palestinians are experiencing some sort of imprisonment". "All Palestinians in some way are prisoners. If you Palestinian living in the Gaza Strip, born under siege in the Gaza Strip in the last 14 years, and you have never left Gaza … you are a prisoner," Baroud explained. "And if you are a Palestinian living in 'Area C' [of the Occupied west Bank] … you cannot leave without Israeli permission, you cannot cross any military checkpoint, you are a prisoner." Solidarity in the age of coronavirus: What the Arabs must do "Those who are living behind checkpoints and behind the Apartheid Wall in the West Bank are prisoners. All Palestinians are experiencing some sort of imprisonment," Baroud added during a talk to mark the day and to discuss his latest book "These Chains Will Be Broken: Palestinian Stories of Struggle and Defiance in Israeli Prisons". "The 5,000 prisoners, or so, who are in Palestine at the moment, are actually a microcosm of the protracted imprisonment in Israel over the past 50 plus years." On April 17, Palestinians mark Prisoners' Day to remind the public of the plight of those thousands of Palestinians imprisoned in Israeli military jails.

News article:
Hamas authorities have arrested seven Gaza residents for participating in a videoconference with peace campaigners in Israel. The arrests, which Hamas confirmed and defended as rooted in national security, have triggered a debate in Palestinian Authority and Gazan Arab society over free speech, and prompted multiple condemnations. Hamas, which runs Gaza, bans many forms of communications with Israel and what it calls the “normalization” of relations with the Jewish state. “We absolutely condemn arrests of individuals because of practicing their right to peaceful expression and assembly,” Saleh Hijazi, the Amnesty International human rights group’s deputy director for the Middle East, told the London-based Asharq al-Awsat newspaper. Rami Aman, 36, the founder of the Gaza Youth Committee, and the six others were accused of treason after speaking on Zoom to the dozens of Israeli activists last week, the newspaper reported Tuesday. The participants discussed their daily lives and expressed hopes for better leadership for both Israelis and PA and Gazan Arabs. Hind Khoudary, a former Amnesty International activist, reportedly played a key role in having the seven arrested, according to Asharq al-Awsat. She criticized Aman on Facebook over what Khoudary called “normalization” with Israel and also tagged several Hamas officials in the online post, prompting them to monitor the call, according to Asharq al-Awsat.

News article:
Senior officials in the European Union and United Nations on Thursday warned Israel not to annex parts of the West Bank, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz signed a coalition agreement saying the move could potentially go ahead as early as July. The European Union foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, issued a stark warning against the intention to annex parts of the West Bank, saying that such a move “would constitute a serious violation of international law.” Borrell said the 27-member bloc does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the territory and that it will “continue to closely monitor the situation and its broader implications, and will act accordingly.” The Foreign Ministry slammed Borrell over his statement. “It’s unfortunate that Josep Borrell, who pretends to be responsible for the foreign relations of the European Union, chooses in this manner to welcome a new government of a central partner to the EU and prefers to see relations between Israel and the EU through the prism of the pandemic and the ‘status of the territories,’” the ministry said in a statement. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The ministry questioned Borrell’s decision to issue the statement, saying he did so only after failing to gain backing for it from all EU states. “We wonder which states the honorable gentleman is choosing to represent,” the ministry said. Foreign Minister Israel Katz thanked EU states that refused to back Borrell’s statement, but didn’t name them. Advertisement “I thank our friends in Europe who oppose Borrell’s announcement and prevented the adoption of the text in the EU’s name. These states recognize the value of relations with Israel and we’ll continue to advance relations between Israel and Europe together with them,” he said. However, a diplomatic source told The Times of Israel that the EU did not hold a vote on approving the text and the meeting dealt more with timing than substance. Meanwhile, in a video briefing with the Security Council, which holds a meeting each month on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the UN Middle East peace envoy, Nikolay Mladenov, said an Israeli annexation would deal a “devastating blow” to the internationally backed two-state solution. While hailing what he called “inspiring examples of cooperation across conflict lines” in the coronavirus battle, Mladenov warned that in the past month there has also been “continued confrontation and fighting, as the human toll of war continues to rise.” “The dangerous prospect of annexation by Israel of parts of the occupied West Bank is a growing threat,” Mladenov said, arguing that such a move would violate international law. The envoy said annexation would also “close the door to a renewal of negotiations and threaten efforts to advance regional peace.” Advertisement Mladenov called on Israeli and Palestinian leaders to “seize this moment to take steps towards peace” and “reject unilateral moves that will only deepen the wedge between the two peoples and undermine the chances for peace.” A peace plan unveiled earlier this year by US President Donald Trump — which angered the Palestinians and was rejected by much of the international community — gave Israel the green light to annex settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley area. Netanyahu and Gantz struck a power-sharing deal to form a national emergency government this week, after three inconclusive elections in less than a year. Netanyahu has heralded the Trump plan as a historic opportunity for Israel but Gantz has been more cautious, offering mixed signals about annexation. Netanyahu’s right-wing base is eager to move forward with annexation while the friendly Trump administration is in office. Israel captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six Day War. The Palestinians seek those territories as part of a future independent state. Annexation of West Bank settlements would infuriate the Palestinians and Israel’s Arab neighbors. The Netanyahu-Gantz deal stipulates that any Israeli action would need US backing, and must take into account Israel’s peace treaties with neighboring Jordan and Egypt.

News article:
The European Union and several European states, including Germany, France and the United Kingdom, reiterated their opposition to the Israeli government's aspiration to annex parts of the West Bank in light of the coalition deal between Benjamin Netanyahu and Gantz. Corona keeps Bibi in power and unmasks the Mossad Credit: Haaretz "The European Union’s position on the status of the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 remains unchanged," wrote foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Thursday, ahead of a meeting at the United Nations Security Counil. "The European Union does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank," Borrell stressed. He said that the European Union would view any annexation as a serious violation of international law and "will continue to closely monitor the situation and its broader implications, and will act accordingly. Israel regretted Borrell's statement and said it is unrepresentative of the position of member states. "Considering the depth of our relations, and in light of the fact that, once again, a similar proposed statement did not receive the support of the EU member states only yesterday, we wonder what policy the distinguished gentleman is vying to represent," an official statement read. Israeli Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz thanked "our friends in Europe who opposed Mr. Borrell’s announcement." At the UN Security Council, the organization's Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov said "Annexation of parts of the West Bank would constitute a serious violation of international law, deal a devastating blow to the two-state solution, close the door to a renewal of negotiations, and threaten efforts to advance regional peace." French Ambassador Nicolas de Rivière went further and said annexation "would not pass unchallenged and shall not be overlooked in our relationship with Israel." The United Kingdom mission said it is concerned that the Netanyahu-Gantz coalition deal will pave the way for annexation and stressed that the action would violate international law and jeopardize the peace process. The German mission said it "advises against the annexation of occupied Palestinian territories" as this would have negative repercussions on the viability of the two-state solution and Israel's standing in the international community. Palestinian Ambassador Mansour Riyad said the pandemic has brought into light Israel's crimes and that Israeli forces are blocking the Palestinian Authority's attempts to curb the spread of the coronavirus. He said that if Israel chooses annexation, it should not be surprised by the resulting chain of events. "How dare the Palestinian representative slander Israel's efforts and lie about IDF soldiers and blame them for spreading the virus, " replied Israel's Ambassador Danny Danon, calling Mansour's statements anti-Semitic. A statement was also made by Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney, who wished the Israeli coalition process well but said annexation is prohibited under international law "whenever and wherever it occurs, in Europe’s neighbourhood or globally. This is a fundamental principle in the relations of states and the rule of law in the modern world. No one state can set it aside at will." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former political rival Benny Gantz signed a coalition deal agreement Monday to co-lead an "emergency government", based on power share and rotation of the premiership. The two sides eventually agreed on annexation of parts of the West Bank, although it is not clear which. According to the political deal, Netanyahu can advance legislation to annex parts of the West Bank starting July 1, on the condition that the move is supported by the U.S. administration. On Wednesday U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that annexing parts of the West Bank is "ultimately Israel's decision to make." In the first comment by a Trump administration official regarding the expected formation of a new government in Israel, Pompeo said the U.S. welcomed that development and is looking forward to continued cooperation with Israel. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas commented Wednesday that “No one should delude themselves that they can take advantage of the fact that the world is busy with the coronavirus crisis to violate our rights. We will not allow anyone to violate our rights."

News article:
A group of 10 European ambassadors, led by the UK, gave a formal protest to Israel on Thursday and stressed that annexation of parts of Judea and Samaria would destabilize the region and harm Israel’s standing in the international community, European diplomats told Barak Ravid of Channel 13 News. The ambassadors of the UK, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Deputy Ambassador of the EU gave the diplomatic protest in a Zoom conference call with the deputy director general of the Israeli foreign ministry, Anna Azari, according to the report. The ambassadors reportedly said during the Zoom meeting that the formation of a national unity government in Israel is an important step, but they are deeply concerned by the part of the coalition agreement which paves the way for sovereignty over parts of Judea and Samaria. The ambassadors told the Israeli foreign ministry official that “annexation of any part of the West Bank by Israel would constitute a clear violation of international law and would have serious repercussions for regional stability as well as Israel’s international standing.” The coalition agreement between Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Blue and White chairman Benny Gantz states that the government could apply sovereignty to parts of Judea and Samaria this coming July. EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell last week warned Israel against applying sovereignty over portions of Judea and Samaria. “The European Union’s position on the status of the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 remains unchanged. In line with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions, including resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), the European Union does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank,” he said “The European Union reiterates that any annexation would constitute a serious violation of international law. The European Union will continue to closely monitor the situation and its broader implications, and will act accordingly.” The US, however, has struck a different tone. A State Department spokesperson said on Monday that “we are prepared to recognize Israeli actions to extend Israeli sovereignty and the application of Israeli law to areas of the West Bank that the vision foresees as being part of the State of Israel.” The spokesperson also added that the US would ask Israel’s new unity government to negotiate with Palestinian Arabs. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week said that application of sovereignty was ultimately "an Israeli decision."

Eleven European ambassadors to Israel on Thursday warned Jerusalem of severe consequences if it moves ahead with plans to annex parts of the West Bank as part of a government coalition deal. The envoys from the UK, Germany, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, Finland and the EU issued a formal objection to the Foreign Ministry against the move, Channel 13 reported. The ambassadors made the protest during a video conference with the Foreign Ministry’s Europe deputy, Anna Azari. “We are very concerned about the clause in the coalition agreement that paves the way for annexing parts of the West Bank. The annexation of any part of the West Bank constitutes a clear violation of international law,” the ambassadors said. “Such unilateral steps will harm efforts to renew the peace process and will have grave consequences for regional stability and for Israel’s standing in the international arena.” The envoys also demanded a freeze on government plans to allow construction in the Givat Hamatos neighborhood in East Jerusalem. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Also on Thursday, the Arab League said that the planned annexation constituted a “new war crime” against the Palestinians during a virtual conference chaired in Cairo. “The implementation of plans to annex any part of the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967, including the Jordan Valley… and the lands on which Israeli settlements are standing represents a new war crime… against the Palestinian people,” Arab foreign ministers said in a joint statement. The Arab League also urged the United States to “withdraw its support in enabling the plans of the occupying Israeli government.” Advertisement On Monday, the United States said it was ready to recognize Israel’s annexation of key parts of the West Bank, but said the offer was contingent on an offer of statehood to the Palestinians. “As we have made consistently clear, we are prepared to recognize Israeli actions to extend Israeli sovereignty and the application of Israeli law to areas of the West Bank that the vision foresees as being part of the State of Israel,” a US State Department spokesperson said when asked if the US would allow Israel’s new government to move forward with the process. “The annexation would be in the context of an offer to the Palestinians to achieve statehood based upon specific terms, conditions, territorial dimensions and generous economic support. This is an unprecedented and highly beneficial opportunity for the Palestinians,” the State Department spokesperson said. The Palestinians have refused to negotiate with the Trump administration, considering it biased. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas threatened last week to cancel all agreements with Israel and the US if Israel moved forward with annexation plans. US President Donald Trump in January unveiled a peace plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Rejected by the Palestinians and condemned by much of the international community, the plan gives Israel the green-light to annex Jewish settlements and other strategic territory in the West Bank. Advertisement An Israeli coalition government agreement reached last week includes a framework for implementing the annexations outlined in the plan, starting in July. Under the US proposal, the Palestinians would be granted a sovereign but demilitarized state in the remaining parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, along with promises of major investment. The Palestinian state’s capital would be on the outskirts of Jerusalem, which would remain fully under Israeli sovereignty. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that he was “confident” Trump would let him fulfill his election promise to apply Israeli sovereignty over parts of the West Bank “a couple of months from now.” According to the wording of the “emergency government” deal between Netanyahu’s Likud party and Benny Gantz’s Blue and White faction, starting July 1, 2020, Netanyahu “will be able to bring the agreement reached with the US on the application of sovereignty [in the West Bank] for the approval of the cabinet and or the Knesset.” In addition, “the law will be passed as quickly as possible… and will not be disrupted or delayed by the chairmen of either the House or the Foreign Affairs and Defense committees.” The Netanyahu-Gantz deal stipulates that any Israeli action would need US backing, and must take into account Israel’s peace treaties with neighboring Jordan and Egypt, the only two Arab states that have formal peace treaties and diplomatic relations with Israel. Netanyahu’s right-wing base is eager to move forward with annexation while the friendly Trump administration is in office.

European ambassadors warn Israel against annexing West Bank Iran Press TV Friday, 01 May 2020 3:26 PM The ambassadors of 11 European countries have warned the Israeli regime that its planned annexation of the occupied West Bank is a "clear violation of international law" that would have "grave consequences" for the regime. Envoys from the UK, Germany, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, and Finland as well as, notably, the European Union (EU) presented their formal objection to the plan on Thursday, a Channel 13 report said, according to the Times of Israel. The protest by the European envoys came during a video conference with the Israeli foreign ministry's deputy for Europe Anna Azari. "We are very concerned about the clause in the coalition agreement that paves the way for annexing parts of the West Bank. The annexation of any part of the West Bank constitutes a clear violation of international law," the ambassadors said. Last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main rival, Benny Gantz, agreed to start plans for annexing parts of the occupied West Bank on July 1 as part of a deal setting up a future coalition cabinet. Until then, elections after elections had left the respective parties of both Netanyahu and Gantz short of a solid parliamentary majority to choose a new prime minister, and no coalition talks had also failed. "Such unilateral steps will harm efforts to renew the peace process and will have grave consequences for regional stability and for Israel's standing in the international arena," the European diplomats said. Many world leaders, governments, and international organizations have warned Israel against the measure. Israel was encouraged to annex settlements and other strategic territory in the occupied West Bank by United States President Donald Trump under a plan that he unveiled in January. The initiative also designated Jerusalem al-Quds as "Israel's undivided capital," among other privileges granted to Israel. While the plan was supposed to be a deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians, no Palestinian official had been involved in preparing it, and all Palestinian factions rejected the plan soon after it was announced.

News article:
Israel is about to get into a new diplomatic clash with Europe. On 1 May, ambassadors of a number of European states to Israel slammed Tel Aviv’s plans to annex the whole of the West Bank, as recently revealed by the new Netanyahu-Gantz coalition government. These countries include Britain, Germany, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark and Finland. Even the European Union (EU) itself was part of the formal objection. “We are very concerned about the clause in the coalition agreement that paves the way for annexing parts of the West Bank. The annexation of any part of the West Bank constitutes a clear violation of international law,” the ambassadors stated. “Such unilateral steps will harm efforts to renew the peace process and will have grave consequences for regional stability and for Israel’s standing in the international arena.” They also called on Israel to freeze its construction plans in the Givat Hamatos neighbourhood in East Jerusalem. This is the second European statement in less than 10 days that challenges Israeli state policies against the Palestinians. The EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell straightforwardly said 23 April that the regional organisation’s “position on the status of the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 remains unchanged”. “In line with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions, including resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), the European Union does not recognise Israeli sovereignty over the Occupied West Bank,” he said. Borrell pointed out that the EU “reiterates that any annexation constitutes a serious violation of international law. The European Union will continue to closely monitor the situation and its broader implications, and will act accordingly.” In response, Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz, said: “It’s unfortunate that Josep Borrell, who pretends to be responsible for the foreign relations of the European Union, chooses in this manner to welcome a new government and a central partner to the EU and prefers to see relations between Israel and the EU through the prism of the [Covid-19] pandemic and the ‘status of the territories.’” As soon as Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival Benny Gantz declared their coalition deal, both stressed that Israel will claim sovereignty over the whole of the West Bank on 1 July and move forward with US President Donald Trump’s controversial “Deal of the Century” peace plan. This escalatory tone was followed by acts of condemnation by Palestinian leaders, the Arab League and even the Arab Joint List, a political alliance of Arab political parties that have seats in the Israeli Knesset. Last week, the Council of Arab Ambassadors to the United Nations slammed Israel’s “illegal policies and annexation agenda” for “Palestinian land” and pointed out that “virtually all Security Council members and the larger membership of the UN” have “condemned these policies”. Arab League chief Ahmed Abul-Gheit, one week earlier, told UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres that such plans will “ignite tensions in the region” and accused Israel of “exploiting the world’s preoccupation with the novel coronavirus to impose a new reality on the ground”. Abdel-Mahdi Metawei, a Palestinian political analyst who is close to the Palestinian Authority, told Al-Ahram Weekly last week that Israel will not succeed because of strong Arab and European opposition to the Trump deal. Netanyahu, he added, is concerned about a potential failure by Trump to get re-elected as president despite the former’s interest in “writing his name” in Israel’s history as the prime minister who launched a full-scale annexation plan and earned US approval for it. However, Daniel Serwer, a scholar at the Washington-based Middle East Institute, said he doubts that European-Arab pressures would stop such a plan. He believes that vocal condemnations are the farthest they can go in their clash with Israel. “What can they do except denounce the annexation and refuse to recognise it? This will become one more source of friction in the trans-Atlantic relationship,” Serwer argued. Trump’s “Deal of the Century” plan recognises Jerusalem as “Israel’s undivided capital”, giving a capital for a potential Palestinian state in northern and eastern neighbourhoods of the city, outside the Israeli security barrier. A small number of Palestinians will be given the right to return to their nation, while Israel will enjoy security control from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. *A version of this article appears in print in the 7 May, 2020 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
The European Union’s Foreign Affairs Commission is reportedly debating punitive measures against Israel should it push forward with its plans to annex parts of Judea and Samaria and the Jordan Valley in accordance with the Trump administration’s Middle East peace plan. Sources familiar with the initiative told Israel Hayom that European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell is the one pushing for sanctions. Borrell, a Spanish diplomat, is known for his animosity toward Israel. This attitude is currently offset by the positive sentiment expressed towards Israel by Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen, a German diplomat and the sitting president of the European Commission. The European Union’s charter states that all major foreign policy decisions can be made only by a consensus among the bloc’s 27 member states. It is therefore believed that Israel’s allies in the European Union—Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic—will block any major punitive action Borrell may try to promote. Currently, Sweden, Ireland and Luxembourg are pushing for the harshest response, namely suspending the E.U.-Israel Association Agreement, which regulates relations between the two. Another potential measure being considered is the exclusion of Israel from Horizon Europe, an ambitious E.U. research and innovation framework slated to run between 2021 and 2027. The program “aims to strengthen the E.U.’s scientific and technological bases, boost Europe’s innovation capacity, competitiveness and jobs and to deliver on citizens’ priorities and sustain socio-economic model and values,” according to its website. A third scenario may see the European Union pull out of the open skies agreement with Israel, which it has yet to ratify. Each of these scenarios entail a significant economic impact on Israel. The E.U.’s foreign ministers are expected to debate the issue in their next meeting, scheduled for Thursday, though it is unlikely a decision will be made at that time, as the session will convene a mere day after the new Israeli government is to be sworn in. Over the weekend, a Palestinian NGO called on Borrell to impose sanctions on Israel over its plans to annex the large settlement blocs in Judea and Samaria, calling the move illegal, the Palestinian news agency WAFA reported. In a letter to Borrell, the European Coordination of Committees and Associations for Palestine expressed “concerns” over Israel’s planned annexation of parts of the West Bank that P.A. seeks to maintain as part of a future state, calling the move “part of the ongoing ethnic cleansing, apartheid and colonization” pursued by Israel. The ECCP’s letter said that to confront “Israel’s unilateral land grab and annexation, immediate actions must to be taken, including sanctions and … [other] concrete measures.” Meanwhile, the Israeli Foreign Ministry summoned E.U. Ambassador to Israel Emanuele Giaufret last week for clarifications following the publication of a memo suggesting that groups supporting, identifying or affiliated with terrorist organizations could receive European Union funding. “The Union’s policy on financing terrorist organizations is a letter of endorsement for incitement, support and involvement in terrorism,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The E.U. Mission in Israel said in response that “the E.U. opposes any incitement to violence or hatred. The allegations that the E.U. supports terrorism are unfounded and unacceptable, and we strongly oppose any such statement.” This article first appeared in Israel Hayom.

News article:
Foreign ministers representing member states of the EU on Friday will debate potential responses to Israel’s decision to annex parts of Judea and Samaria if that clause in the Likud-Kahol Lavan coalition agreement is implemented. Despite the fact that the newly appointed EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, wants to wait and see what the new Israeli government will do, some of the member countries are exerting pressure to approve sanctions in advance as a means of deterrence. This can include denying Israel membership in trade agreements, grants or other collaborative ventures in various industries. Sources close to the discussions told Haaretz that there is growing support among EU countries to slap sanctions that are meant to deter Israel from asserting sovereignty over any territory. Spain, France, Sweden, Ireland, Belgium and Luxembourg are all reportedly to be calling for sanctions even before a final decision is made. The sources also said that when it comes to trade agreements, a unanimous agreement is not required by all the member states. This means that Israel won’t be able to rely on the veto of Israel’s EU allies like Hungary and the Czech Republic to rescue them from these types of decisions. Additionally, member states can enact their own independent protests against Israel. “No one wants to reach a stage were EU-Israel ties are damaged for the long term, but they will be in the event of a unilateral annexation. If only because of the precedent it would set anywhere else,” a source told Haaretz. This translates into the EU enforcing a “carrot and stick” approach whereby the option of opening a dialogue between the new EU leadership and the new Israeli government will be a first resort but at the same time, relaying messages of economic threats in the event of an Israeli decision on unilateral annexation. While speaking to journalists in Brussels on Monday, Peter Stano, the spokesman for EU external affairs, was asked by a reporter if there will be “some kind of sanctions” imposed on Israel as a response to annexation. Stano offered a rather vague response saying that the foreign ministers will discuss the situation in the Middle East on Friday during the meeting of the EU Council. He added that imposing sanctions “is up to the member states; at this stage, let’s not speculate.”

News article:
European Union foreign ministers will meet in Brussels Friday, a day after the swearing-in of Israel’s new government, to consider punitive responses to Israel’s plans to annex parts of the West Bank, multiple reports have indicated. Several European nations led by France, and including Ireland, Sweden, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg, have reportedly expressed support for threats of punitive action in a bid to deter the new Israeli government from carrying out the move with a green light from Washington. The EU bloc is Israel’s largest trading partner, grants Israel favored trading status, and helps fund Israeli scientific research and development through its massive Horizon 2020 program. According to the Haaretz daily, the proposed steps include announcing that Israel would be prevented from entering into trade agreements with the bloc, receiving EU grants or participating in other forms of cooperation with the union. It is not clear if the steps would apply to future agreement or freeze existing ones. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms As part of their coalition agreement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Blue and White chief Benny Gantz agreed that the government that is due to be sworn in Thursday can begin moving forward with applying Israeli sovereignty to settlements and the Jordan Valley after July 1, a move expected to enjoy backing from a majority of lawmakers in the current Knesset. Though Gantz is believed to oppose unilateral action, he acquiesced to Netanyahu’s demand to allow the matter to be brought to a vote in parliament. “There is clearly a need to look at what annexation means in the context of international law and we do need to know our options,” a senior EU diplomat told Reuters. Advertisement “We also need to say what exactly the consequences of annexation would be, ideally as a way to stop any such move,” the diplomat said. On Monday, European External Action Service spokesman Peter Stano said any EU decision on future sanctions would depend on the results of Friday’s deliberations. “Annexation is contrary to international law and if annexation goes ahead, the EU will act accordingly,” he said, according to Reuters. And in February, foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said annexation “could not pass unchallenged.” The foreign ministers are unlikely to issue any decision on Friday. The Commission and the External Action Service, the EU’s executive and foreign service branches, have yet to propose specific options for member states to consider. Also key to the discussions will be finding potential punitive measures that would not require the unanimous agreement of all 27 bloc members, as Israel’s allies, including Hungary and the Czech Republic, would likely veto any proposals that require unanimity. Advertisement “No one wants to reach the point that Israel’s relations with the union are harmed for the long term, but that’s what will happen if Israel annexes, if only because of the precedent an annexation would set for every other place” where nations are fighting over disputed land, an EU source was quoted by Haaretz as saying. Annexation of settlements and the Jordan Valley has been a key campaign promise of Netanyahu and his Likud party in recent elections. A plurality of slightly fewer than half of Israelis back the idea, and fewer than a third think the government will actually go through with it, according to a survey of Israelis released Sunday. Asked whether they back annexation in the near future, 44.7 percent of respondents to an Israel Democracy Institute survey said they support or strongly support the move. The poll found 31.8% oppose annexation, and 23.5% didn’t know or didn’t answer. A slight majority of Jews — 51.7% — support annexation, the poll found, while only 8.8% of Arab Israelis were in favor. Among Jews, 27.9% opposed annexation, and 20.4% didn’t know or didn’t answer. Among Arabs, 51.9% were opposed, and 39.4% didn’t know or didn’t answer. Support for annexation among Jews was unsurprisingly divided along partisan lines, with 71% of self-defined right-wing Jews backing it, 31% of centrists and only 8% of left-wingers. Overall, 31.8% of Israelis think the government will actually push ahead with annexation in the coming year.

News article:
European Union representatives are set to meet in Brussels on Friday to weigh in on Israel’s plan for the illegal annexation of the occupied West Bank and mull sanctions if it proceeds with the illegal action, a report stated on Tuesday. According to Israeli outlet Haaretz, foreign ministers of EU member states will meet in the Belgian capital to review proposed measures against Israel – should the government proceed with plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. EU foreign policy spokesperson Peter Stano said that ministers will hold a video conference on Friday to discuss the annexation. “Annexation is not in line with international law. If it goes ahead, the EU will act accordingly,” Stano told the European Commission’s daily press briefing on Monday. Asked if Israel will be sanctioned by the EU, Stano said the decision was “up to the member states; at this stage, let’s not speculate”. EU countries want to approve the planned sanctions as soon as possible to discourage Israel from going forward with its plan, while EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell is inclined to wait, the Haaretz report said. France, Spain, Ireland, Sweden, Belgium and Luxembourg are all pushing for tough punishments against Israel if it ignores warnings on the annexation, sources familiar with the discussions told Haaretz. A Reuters report confirmed the member states were pushing for a “tough EU response” to the planned annexation. EU mulls deterrent sanctions *in advance of* annexation. Europe understands correctly that once annexation happens, it'll be almost impossible to undo. The point is to prevent, not punish afterward. https://t.co/m8a6nAKHgJ — Ron Skolnik (@Ron_Skolnik) May 12, 2020 On April 20, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main rival Benny Gantz signed a coalition agreement that includes a clause to advance plans to annex parts of the West Bank, including Israeli settlements, starting on July 1. But Palestinians have expressed outrage at Israel’s plans to cement its hold further on land it seized in the 1967 Middle East war, a territory they are seeking for a state On May 6, US envoy to Israel David Friedman said that Israel is expected to annex large parts of the occupied West Bank within the coming weeks. Israel in February began mapping the areas it seeks to seize control of as part of the plan, and is expected to finish that mapping process in the coming weeks, Friedman told Israel Hayom.

News article:
After eradicating the coronavirus that ravaged the countries of Europe and mending the deep rifts within its ranks, the European Union has circled back to focus on its favorite pet issue: Israel. The new Israeli government, which was barely assembled and hasn’t even published a plan of action yet, is already facing E.U. threats of punitive action, including economic sanctions and even the suspension of diplomatic ties if Israel dares follow through with its intention to apply Israeli law in parts of Judea and Samaria. The bureaucrats at E.U. headquarters in Brussels can’t actually drag Europe into a war on Israel, which has close ties with many countries on the continent, such as Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and others. These countries all harbor animosity for the European Union, which failed in the moment of truth and left them, each on their own, to contend with the quarantines, deaths and economic crises caused by the coronavirus. But several leading European countries, chief among them France, Belgium, Spain and Ireland, are determined to spearhead an anti-Israel initiative and have threatened to enact punitive measures even if the majority of E.U. countries don’t join them. Disagreements between friends are legitimate, but when it comes to Israel-Europe relations, or to be more precise, Israel’s relations with several specific E.U. countries, this isn’t the case. The European Union doesn’t care about the Palestinians whatsoever. Its concern for international law, which it says Israel is violating, also isn’t a top priority. After all, the European Union is indifferent to the Turkish occupation of Cyprus, and Brussels doesn’t typically care about Tibet or Western Sahara either. Israel, however, is always seen as an attractive target to flagellate, for the purpose of winning Arab and Muslim brownie points. Beyond that, the European Union still abides by its decades-long fixation whereby the Palestinian issue is the key to solving all of the Middle East’s ills. And while the Europeans don’t care much about the levels of poverty and distress throughout the Middle East, they are worried about the waves of immigration flooding their continent due to unrest and instability in the Arab world, and are convinced that reprimanding Israel will help them turn the tide. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories It appears, however, that there’s another inherent motive for this European obsession with Israel: The Europeans flog Israel, but their aim is to hurt U.S. President Donald Trump, who many Europeans view as an adversary. It is a symptom of deeply rooted anti-American sentiment, which combines jealousy with a touch of condescension, toward a president who represents such a successful antithesis to the “old continent.” The close-knit alliance between the United States and Israel undoubtedly adds to Israel’s clout and opens up numerous paths for Israel across the globe. Not in Europe. After all, in the eyes of the Europeans, the increasingly intimate bond shared by Washington and Jerusalem is something akin to original sin. Hence the arrows being launched from Europe at Israel—instead of at Washington—in the hope that the White House feels the sting along with the Israeli government. This, therefore, is a profound European undercurrent that even an arrangement with the Palestinians isn’t likely to reverse. Israel’s relations with these European countries will inevitably return to normal, as there are enough mature leaders in Europe—for example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel—who are attentive to Israel and its problems and are cognizant of Europe’s own interests in maintaining ties with it. But we can assume that the bureaucrats in Brussels, supported by several European countries, will wait for the next opportunity to kick Israel.

Source: Xinhua| 2020-05-21 01:10:52|Editor: huaxia Video Player Close UNITED NATIONS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The four EU members of the UN Security Council -- Belgium, Estonia, France and Germany -- plus Poland, which has just left the council, on Wednesday warned against Israel's planned annexation of occupied Palestinian territory. The five countries expressed grave concern over Israel's plan to annex parts of the West Bank as stated by the prime minister when presenting his government to the Knesset (parliament) on May 17 and as envisaged in the coalition agreement signed earlier. "We strongly urge Israel to refrain from any unilateral decision that would lead to the annexation of any occupied Palestinian territory and would be, as such, contrary to international law," said the five countries in a joint statement. "International law is a fundamental pillar of the international rules-based order. In this respect, we recall that we will not recognize any changes to the 1967 borders, unless agreed by Israelis and Palestinians," said the statement. The two-state solution, with Jerusalem as the future capital for both states, is the only way to ensure sustainable peace and stability in the region, it said. The five countries congratulated the new government in Israel and looked forward to continuing to work with the Israeli government in a constructive and comprehensive way. They showed their willingness to support and facilitate resumed direct and meaningful negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians in order to resolve all final-status issues and achieve a just and lasting peace. "We stand ready to engage immediately with the new government and with all relevant stakeholders," said the statement. Enditem

News article:
Houses in the Israeli settlement of Kedumim are seen in the foreground as part of the Palestinian city of Nablus is seen in the background (far left) in the West Bank, Feb. 20, 2020. (Reuters) Asharq Al-Awsat France and the United Nations envoy to the Middle East urged Israel on Wednesday against annexing parts of the occupied West Bank. A partial annexation would be a serious violation, and France is working with European partners to come up with a joint action plan for prevention and reprisal should Israel make such a move, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Wednesday. "For the past few days we have held several video conferences with European colleagues ... with a view to deciding on a joint preventive action and eventually a reprisal if such a decision were taken," he said at a parliament hearing. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said cabinet discussions will start in July over extending Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, as was mooted under US President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan. Israel must abandon its threat to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, said UN Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov, branding such a plan as a serious violation of international law that would “close the door to a renewal of negotiations.” “The continuing threat of annexation by Israel of parts of the West Bank would constitute a most serious violation of international law, deal a devastating blow to the two-state solution, close the door to a renewal of negotiations,” he said during a meeting of the UN Security Council. “Israel must abandon its threat of annexation. And the Palestinian leadership to re-engage with all members of the quartet,” he said, referring to the United States, Russia, the European Union and the UN. He urged the quartet to “come forward with a proposal that will enable the quartet to take up its mediation role.” Mladenov urged the 15-member council to back a push by UN chief Antonio Guterres against unilateral steps that would hinder diplomatic efforts to renew negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Such a statement by the council is unlikely as it has to be agreed by consensus and the United States traditionally shields its ally Israel from any action. “This council cannot dictate the end to this conflict. We can only encourage the parties to sit down together to determine how they wish to make progress,” US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft said. Pompeo ‘regrets’ Palestinian threats Several Security Council members such as Indonesia and the European countries have warned Israel against the planned annexations. In a joint statement France, Belgium, Germany and Estonia reaffirmed that they "will not recognize any changes to the 1967 borders, unless agreed by Israelis and Palestinians." "We strongly urge Israel to refrain from any unilateral decision that would lead to the annexation of any occupied Palestinian territory and would be, as such, contrary to international law," they said, reaffirming their support for a two state solution as the only one capable of bringing peace to the region. The Palestinians have rejected Trump’s peace plan. On Tuesday, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas announced an end to the Palestinians' security arrangements with Israel over its annexation plans. Mladenov said he would speak Thursday with Palestinian leaders about the practical consequences of their announcement, which were not spelled out by Abbas. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday voiced regret at Palestinian threats to end security coordination if Israel annexes occupied territory. "We hope that the security arrangements will continue to be in place, that the work that's done on the ground there to keep people in Israel and Palestinians safe will continue," Pompeo told reporters. Pompeo, who met Netanyahu in Jerusalem last week, said the Palestinians would benefit from the Trump plan, which promises them an independent but condensed and demilitarized state as well as international investment. "The Palestinians have continued to refuse to just simply sit down and enter into negotiation based on President Trump's Vision for Peace," Pompeo said. Joe Biden, Trump's presumptive Democratic challenger in November elections, on Tuesday declared his opposition to annexation, saying it would undermine hopes for peace.

News article:
Hungary and Austria on Wednesday warned their counterparts in the European Union against endorsing a double standard against Israel with regard to E.U. resolutions. Budapest and Vienna have consistently been the sole opponents of the harsh criticism expressed by E.U. foreign policy chief Josep Borrell against the Jewish state since Israel’s government said it plans to go ahead with plans to apply Israeli law to large parts of Judea and Samaria. Borrell said last week that he will explore the option of imposing sanctions on Israel if it goes through with the move, which is endorsed by the United States. The 27-nation European Union decides on foreign policy moves by consensus, but Borrell has repeatedly disregarded the opposition of a minority of member states to his threats against and condemnations of Israel. On Monday night, Borrell, with the support of 25 E.U. member states, issued a statement saying, “We strongly urge Israel to refrain from any unilateral decision that would lead to the annexation of any occupied Palestinian territory and would be, as such, contrary to International Law.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said his country rejects “prejudice” against Israel and called to hold a dialogue with the new government, according to the Austrian news site Kurier. According to The Jerusalem Post, Austria and Hungary urged Borrell to invite Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi to the E.U. Foreign Affairs Council meeting on Friday. The Israeli Foreign Ministry criticized Borrell’s “megaphone diplomacy,” saying, “we called for a gradual approach of caution, not rushing forward and certainly not alienating Israel,” the Hungarian source said. “We believe Israel is a really important strategic partner in the Mediterranean region.” Borrell’s belligerent rhetoric does a disservice to the European Union, especially if it wants to be taken seriously by Israel and the United States as a player in the Middle East peace process, a ministry official said. Hungary and Austria opposed Borrell’s previous statements against Israel, including one that said that the application of Israeli law to the Jordan Valley and parts of Judea and Samaria “would not go unchallenged,” which Israel’s Foreign Ministry described as a threat. Also on Wednesday, French Ambassador to the United Nations Nicolas de Riviere warned Israel that any annexation move “would not be without consequences to the E.U. relationship with Israel.” Annexation “would be detrimental to Israel’s role in the world, to its integration in its regional environment, as well as to Israel’s relationships with its partners,” he said. Belgian Ambassador to the United Nations Marc Pecsteen told the Security Council that his country remained “deeply concerned” about the portions of Israel’s coalition agreement that would allow the country to extend its law to Israeli settlements in Judea and Samaria as early as July. “We call on the international community to exert all efforts to prevent any such steps,” he said. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft called on Israelis and Palestinians to return to the negotiating table. “If both sides are serious about their talking, it is time for both sides to prove it,” she said. Craft told the UNSC that statements of “concern” would not resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “This council cannot dictate the end to this conflict,” she said. “We can only encourage the parties to sit down together to determine how they wish to make progress.” This article first appeared in Israel Hayom.

News article:
Ethiopia sees no reason to delay filling its controversial mega-dam despite warnings from Egypt that such a move could destabilize the region, according to a letter from Ethiopia’s foreign minister to the UN Security Council. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam has been a source of tension in the Nile River basin ever since Ethiopia broke ground on the project in 2011. Advertisement Addis Ababa says the dam is crucial for its economy, while Cairo fears it will disrupt the river that provides almost all its water. For all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app. Talks earlier this year involving the two governments and Sudan - another downstream country - failed to produce a breakthrough. Read more: Sudan rejects Ethiopia’s proposal to fill controversial mega-dam Ethiopia asks US to postpone final talks over dam dispute In April Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed proposed proceeding with “first stage filling” that would collect 18.4 billion cubic meters of water in the dam’s reservoir over two years. But both Egypt and Sudan fear the reservoir - which has a capacity of 74 billion cubic meters - will trap their essential water supplies. Filling and operating the dam “would jeopardize the water security, food security, and indeed, the very existence of over 100 million Egyptians, who are entirely dependent on the Nile River for their livelihood,” Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said in a letter to the UN Security Council dated May 1. “This is a situation that potentially poses a serious threat to peace and security throughout the region,” he said. In a response dated May 14 and seen Monday by AFP, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Gedu Andargachew accused Egypt of being obstructionist. “Ethiopia does not have a legal obligation to seek approval of Egypt to fill the dam,” Gedu said. “Ethiopia has made extraordinary efforts to accommodate Egypt’s unending demands and unpredictable behavior,” he added. Egypt wants Ethiopia to endorse a draft agreement emerging from the talks earlier this year facilitated by the US Treasury Department, which stepped in after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi put in a request to his ally US President Donald Trump. But Ethiopia skipped the most recent round of those talks and denies any deal was agreed. While Egypt’s letter to the Security Council raises the stakes further, the possibility of armed conflict stemming from the dam dispute is still “very unlikely,” said William Davison of the International Crisis Group, a conflict-prevention organization. “We could expect some sort of diplomatic escalation, more aggressive rhetoric. But a negotiated resolution to this is obviously the best way out for everyone, and there still seems to be plenty of possibility of that,” Davison said.

News article:
The prime ministers of Egypt and Sudan discussed Ethiopia’s controversial dam project on the River Nile during a meeting held on Tuesday via video conference that was attended by both countries' intelligence chiefs and irrigation and foreign ministers. Egypt's Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly and his Sudanese counterpart Abdalla Hamdok discussed “all aspects” of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) during the meeting, Egypt’s foreign ministry said in a statement late on Tuesday. The massive $4.8 billion mega project, under construction on the Blue Nile since 2011, has triggered a diplomatic row between Egypt and Ethiopia. During the meeting, Hamdok said he will call Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to “discuss the resumption of the tripartite negotiation as soon as possible,” Sudan’s official news agency SUNA said. Cairo and Khartoum stressed during the meeting “the need to reach a tripartite agreement that takes into account the interests of the three countries, and to continue negotiations based on what was agreed upon in Washington,” SUNA added. The US, represented by the Treasury Department, along with the World Bank stepped in last year to host tripartite negotiations that began in November after years-long negotiations between the three countries hit a dead end. Following four months of negotiations brokered by Washington, during which the three nations initially agreed on mitigation mechanisms to adjust the filling and operation of the dam during dry periods and drought, the US and the World Bank drafted a deal that was due to be signed in late February. Ethiopia skipped the latest round of talks and only Egypt initialled the deal. Ethiopian Irrigation and Electricity Minister Sileshi Bekele said on Tuesday that his country has the right to use the 86 percent share of water it contributes to the River Nile, stressing the dam has no significant harm on any of the downstream countries, according to the Ethiopian News Agency ENA. Also on Tuesday, the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan to “peacefully resolve any remaining differences and to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement.” Ethiopia has backpedalled on a 2015 Declaration of Principles deal that obliges the three African countries to reach an agreement on the guidelines of filling and operating the dam, telling the UN Security Council (UNSC) in a 14 May letter that it “does not have a legal obligation to seek the approval of Egypt to fill the dam.” Article 5 of the Declaration of Principles stipulates that all three countries should reach an agreement on the rules of filling and operating the 6,000-megawatt dam before starting the process of filling the reservoir. Ethiopia’s 22-page letter to the UNSC came in response to an Egyptian letter sent to the president of the UNSC on 1 May stressing Egypt’s "unwavering commitment" to concluding a comprehensive agreement on the GERD based on the 2015 deal. According to the Egyptian letter, the Ethiopian prime minister sent on 10 April a letter to the president of Egypt and the prime minister of Sudan proposing they agree to an Ethiopian plan covering only the first stage of the filling of GERD. The Ethiopian proposal was rejected by both countries, the Egyptian 17-page letter said, stressing that any agreement on the GERD must be comprehensive and "must regulate the complete process of filling the dam and its operation". Egypt also blamed Ethiopia for trying to establish a deal without taking the interests of downstream countries into consideration, the letter noted. Last week, Sudan joined Egypt in repudiating efforts by Ethiopia to progress its mega-dam, with Hamdok sending a letter to his Ethiopian counterpart disapproving of Addis Ababa’s proposed agreement which he said lacks several technical and legal aspects, according to the Sudanese cabinet. "The signing of any partial agreement for the first stage cannot be approved as technical and legal aspects must be incorporated in the agreement, including the coordination and data exchange mechanism, dam safety and environmental and social impacts," Hamdok said in his letter. Ethiopia hopes the massive $4.8 billion megaproject on the Blue Nile will allow it to become Africa’s largest power exporter. But Egypt, which relies on the Nile for the vast majority of its freshwater, fears the dam will diminish its water supply that has already been below scarcity level. Egypt has a water share of around 570 cubic metres per person annually, well below the water scarcity level of 1,000 cubic metres per person per year. The figure is expected to drop further to 500 cubic metres by 2025. Search Keywords: Short link:

Source: Xinhua| 2020-05-22 19:44:58|Editor: huaxia Video Player Close CAIRO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said it is willing to resume negotiations with Sudan and Ethiopia over the filling of the controversial Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), state-run Ahram newspapers reported on Friday. "Egypt is always ready to enter into negotiations and participate in upcoming meetings between the ministers of irrigations of the three countries," the Egyptian foreign ministry said in a statement. It added that "serious and constructive talks would contribute to a fair, balanced, and comprehensive agreement." The ministry said the agreement would have to take into account "Egypt's water interests as well as those of Ethiopia and Sudan." The statement came after the announcement on Thursday by Khartoum and Addis Ababa "to resume technical discussions about the filling and operation of the dam." On Thursday, Prime Minister of Sudan Abdalla Hamdok and Prime Minister of Ethiopia Abiy Ahmed held an online meeting and agreed to resume the talks in order to reach a final agreement on the filling and operation policies of the GERD. The meeting came after Addis Ababa said it would not delay filling the GERD, which it began constructing in 2011. Both Egypt and Sudan fear the reservoir, which has a capacity of 74 billion cubic meters, will impact their essential water supplies. Hamdok and Abiy's talks were the first after a diplomatic spat that broke out between Egypt and Ethiopia reached the United Nations Security Council. The negotiations between the three countries reached a deadlock last February after Ethiopia skipped the final round of talks in Washington. Enditem

News article:
CAIRO: Ethiopia has opened the floodgates to further controversy over a giant dam scheme by rejecting Egypt’s historic claims to the waters of the Nile. Ahead of the anticipated resumption of stalled talks over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) project, two Ethiopian ministers poured water over the Egyptian stance on river rights. In a speech to political party representatives and religious leaders regarding the latest developments in GERD negotiations, Ethiopian Minister of Water, Irrigation and Energy Seleshi Bekele said the talks, also involving Sudan, were being “clouded by Egypt’s tendency to recall and confirm the so-called (historic rights) in water, which can never be accepted by Ethiopia or Nile-sharing countries.” Ethiopian Minister of Foreign Affairs Gedu Andargachew added that his country’s position was firm with regard to utilizing its water resources in a fair way “in accordance with the agreed cooperation principles and not causing any major damage.” Meanwhile, Ethiopian religious leaders have called on the government to press ahead with the construction of the dam while negotiating with Nile-sharing countries. Ethiopia’s official news agency ENA, reported that a statement issued during a press conference by the Ethiopian inter-religious council of seven institutions, “underlined Ethiopia’s natural right in developing the Nile.” The council also called for the resumption of tripartite discussions. Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church Patriarch Abune Mathias said the government needed to continue with construction of the dam on the basis of mutual understanding with upstream countries and without any foreign intervention. Mathias pointed out that the Ethiopian people had played a big part in funding the project in the hope of improving their living conditions and seeing the development for their country, adding that work should carry on “for the sake of the people” without causing any damage to Nile-sharing countries. Cardinal Berhaneyesus Demerew Souraphiel, head of the Ethiopian Catholic Church, said that Ethiopia had “the right to develop its rivers in order to provide electricity for millions of its citizens, just like Egypt did. Egyptians are provided with electricity better than the Ethiopians. In our situation, students and families do not have electricity. “Upstream countries must know that the Ethiopian people do not have the intention to harm Egypt or Sudan,” he added. Ethiopian Islamic Affairs Supreme Council Secretary-General Sheikh Qassem Mohammed Tag El-Din also agreed that Ethiopia should carry on with building the dam “in the best interest of its people who are living in darkness and who do not have electricity. “Concerning the dam, we need to stand together in harmony and even make sacrifices if this is what it takes to complete the project,” he added. The tripartite negotiations, which have been stalled for several months, are close to resuming. The Sudanese Ministry of Irrigation announced that two separate meetings were recently held between Sudanese Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Yasser Abbas and his counterparts from Egypt and Ethiopia, Mohammed Abdel-Ati and Bekele, respectively. The ministry added that two members of the delegation from each country attended the meetings which had been set up to pave the way for fresh GERD negotiations. In a statement, Sudan’s irrigation ministry said that the ministerial meetings had followed recent talks held between Sudanese Prime Minister Abdullah Hamdok and his Egyptian and Ethiopian counterparts. Abbas Sheraqy, professor of water resources at Cairo University’s faculty of African studies, said Ethiopia’s attempts to return to the negotiation table to settle the GERD issue had swung between resumption and manipulation. He pointed out that Ethiopia was ready to resume GERD discussions despite having failed to attend the final day of the last round of negotiations in Washington in February last year, when it was due to sign an agreement, drafted by the US in collaboration with the World Bank, on the filling and operation of the dam. Ethiopia’s U-turn did “not befit a sovereign state that is a UN member under the pretext that it needed more consultations, as if nine years of negotiations were not enough,” he added. Sheraqy underlined the need to resume the talks in Washington and not to allow Ethiopia to cancel them which, he said, was its precondition to resuming them. He added that Ethiopia recently called for allowing downstream countries to attend the negotiations under the umbrella of the African Union. Addis Ababa, he noted, was aiming to waste time and further complicate the GERD issue and was pushing Egypt into a new issue with downstream countries. Egypt has stressed during its negotiations with Ethiopia the need to maintain its historic rights to the Nile waters. A 1929 treaty (and a subsequent one in 1959) gave Egypt and Sudan rights to nearly all of the Nile waters. The document also gives Egypt veto powers over any projects by upstream countries that would affect its share of the waters. Ethiopia launched construction in 2011 on the Blue Nile in the northern Ethiopian highlands, from where 85 percent of the Nile’s waters flow. One of Egypt’s main worries is that if the water flow diminishes, it could affect Lake Nasser, the reservoir further downriver, behind Egypt’s Aswan Dam. Ethiopia said that 73 percent of the GERD project had been completed. Its government is to start deliberations within a month on a date to start filling the dam.

Khartoum’s letter to the UNSC comes a few weeks after Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan agreed to resume the technical discussions on the GERD following months of disputes Sudan has urged the United Nations Security Council to encourage all parties with a stake in the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) to “refrain from any unilateral measures” that could affect regional and international peace and security. In a letter to the Security Council on Tuesday, Sudanese Foreign Minister Asma Abdalla explained Sudan’s position on the ongoing developments related to the dam, including an initiative adopted by Sudan to resume negotiations on the disputed dam with Egypt and Ethiopia. Sudan asked the Security Council to support its efforts to resume talks in good faith to reach a comprehensive agreement between all parties. The letter stressed Sudan’s principled decision on “negotiating in good faith,” to which it has committed during negotiations given its belief in the importance of a solid foundation for cooperation between the three countries. The letter listed some of the potential positive impacts of the mega-dam on Sudan, including the regulation of the flow of the Blue Nile, which would reduce annual floods during rainy seasons and enable the country to better manage its irrigation system. The dam will also increase the power generation from existing hydropower plants, and will increase the navigation depth of the Blue Nile, the letter added. On the other hand, listing the negative impacts of the dam, Sudan said that the GERD would completely change the flow of the Blue Nile by flattening its hydrograph. “With this gigantic size, the GERD risks causing significant negative impacts to Sudan if not properly designed, constructed, filled and operated,” reads the letter. “These impacts range from threatening the lives and safety of millions of Sudanese citizens living directly downstream from the GERD, to the operational safety of the Sudanese dams, to the flood-plain agricultural system of the country, and the socioeconomic and environmental impacts along the Blue Nile downstream from the main Nile River, all the way up to the border with Egypt," the letter added. “For the positive impacts to be realised and for the negative impacts to be mitigated there has to be an agreement in place with Ethiopia on how to fill and operate the GERD, otherwise the GERD stands to cause substantial risk to Sudan," Khartoum said. In the letter Sudan also requested the Security Council encourage all parties to refrain from taking unilateral actions such as filling the dam’s reservoir without reaching a comprehensive agreement. It also asked the Security Council to encourage the avoidance of any action which jeopardises “regional and international peace and security.” It also asks the UN council to support Sudan’s efforts and call upon all the parties to resume immediate negotiations in good faith with “the objective of resolving the pending issues and concluding a final comprehensive agreement.” Sudan also affirmed its commitment to the rules of international law stipulated in the UN’s Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses. The rules mainly cover the equitable and reasonable use of watercourses and the obligation not to cause significant harm to other watercourses, and the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. Khartoum’s letter a comes few weeks after Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan agreed to resume technical discussions on the mega-dam. The tripartite negotiations reached a deadlock in February after Ethiopia skipped a final round of talks in Washington, leading to a diplomatic war of words between Cairo and Addis Ababa. On 1 May, Egypt sent a memo to the Security Council blaming Ethiopia for trying to establish a deal without taking the interests of downstream countries, Egypt and Sudan, into consideration. Egypt rejected, along with Sudan, an Ethiopian proposal put forth last month amid the ongoing discord, wherein Addis Ababa proposed a “partial agreement” that would only cover the first stage of the filling. Addis Ababa told the Security Council in May in a letter sent in response to the Egyptian memo that it “does not have a legal obligation to seek the approval of Egypt to fill the dam.” Egypt has said it is ready for a revival of talks but stressed the importance of "serious and constructive” talks between the three countries’ irrigation ministers to contribute to a fair, balanced and comprehensive agreement that would preserve Egypt’s water rights and the interests of both Sudan and Ethiopia. Some 85 percent of the Nile water that reaches Egypt flows from the Ethiopian highlands, mainly from the Blue Nile. Egypt receives 55.5 billion cubic metres of water from the Nile annually, but requires over 80 billion cubic metres to cover its needs. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said on Monday that his country is determined to complete its dam project, despite the objections Egypt and Sudan have repeatedly voiced. On 1 May, Egypt sent a memo to the Security Council blaming Ethiopia for trying to establish a deal without taking the interests of downstream countries, Egypt and Sudan, into consideration. The Ethiopian premier’s statement came during the question-and-answer session at the Ethiopian House of Peoples’ Representatives (HPR) on Monday, reported by the Ethiopian News Agency (ENA). “We are tired of begging and the desire to develop does not mean we have intentions to harm other countries,” ENA quoted Ahmed as saying. Ahmed asserted that roughly 50 million Ethiopians don’t have access to clean water and electricity, and completing the dam project will help in fulfilling the basic rights of Ethiopians, “like that of Egypt,” the ENA reported. Ahmed argues that upon completion, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) will have pivotal importance to Egypt, Sudan and the entire African continent. The Ethiopian prime minister told parliament that the six years' delay in GERD construction has cost the county about $6 billion in addition to other expenditure, and it is estimated that the dam will generate $27 million per day and increase the total electricity access in Ethiopia to 50 percent. On Monday, Russian Ambassador to Ethiopia Evgeny Terekhin expressed his country’s readiness to help Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia achieve a “mutually beneficial agreement” in the GERD negotiations during a meeting with the Ethiopian Minister of Foreign Affairs Gedu Andargachew. The Ethiopian foreign minister welcomed the Russian initiative, ENA reported. The tripartite negotiations reached a deadlock in February after Ethiopia skipped a final round of talks in Washington, leading to a diplomatic war of words between Cairo and Addis Ababa. Egypt rejected, along with Sudan, an Ethiopian proposal put forth in April amid the ongoing discord, wherein Addis Ababa proposed a “partial agreement” that would only cover the first stage of the filling.

Ethiopia seems to be very confident in its ability to fill the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) despite pressure by Egypt. (AFP) Ethiopia seems to be very confident in its ability to fill the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) despite pressure by Egypt. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed stressed on Monday that the decision to fill the dam is “irreversible.” He said the entire construction was progressing as planned and has reached the filling of the reservoir. “For us, GERD is a matter of development and national identity that will not hurt Egypt and Sudan,” the premier stressed, adding that “no one can stop us from completing the dam.” Ethiopia has ignored Egyptian pressure, included threats to file a complaint to the UN Security Council. Cairo rejects any “unilateral decision” by Ethiopia without reaching a comprehensive agreement that meets the interests of all parties, including Khartoum. According to former Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Dr. Hossam Moghazy, Egypt will not object to the first filling process during the upcoming rainy season in July. However, he stressed that this should be part of a comprehensive agreement that sets the rules for the filling and operation of the $4 billion GERD. Moghazy told Asharq Al-Awsat that his country counts on the decision to resume the tripartite negotiations in the coming period, based on Sudan’s initiative. “Arrangements are currently being made with all parties to determine the date and terms of the talks.” Sudan and Egypt both agree on their rejection to fill the dam reservoir before reaching a comprehensive agreement, while turning to Washington’s authority in the upcoming meeting to resolve controversial issues only, instead of returning to square one of the negotiations. Sudan, Ethiopia and Egypt had been expected to sign an agreement in Washington on the filling and operation of the dam in February, but Ethiopia skipped the meeting and only Egypt initialed the deal. These talks are sponsored by the US Treasury department in partnership with the World Bank. GERD has been under construction since 2011 when Ethiopia kicked off building it near its border with Sudan on the Blue Nile, which flows into the Nile River. The construction has sparked concerns in Cairo that Egypt's already scarce supplies of Nile waters, on which its population of more than 100 million people is almost entirely dependent, would be further restricted.

Ethiopia seems to be very confident in its ability to fill the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) despite pressure by Egypt. (AFP) Ethiopia seems to be very confident in its ability to fill the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) despite pressure by Egypt. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed stressed on Monday that the decision to fill the dam is “irreversible.” He said the entire construction was progressing as planned and has reached the filling of the reservoir. “For us, GERD is a matter of development and national identity that will not hurt Egypt and Sudan,” the premier stressed, adding that “no one can stop us from completing the dam.” Ethiopia has ignored Egyptian pressure, included threats to file a complaint to the UN Security Council. Cairo rejects any “unilateral decision” by Ethiopia without reaching a comprehensive agreement that meets the interests of all parties, including Khartoum.

Sudan minister: Safety of Renaissance Dam better than Sudan, Egypt dams Earlier on Monday, Ethiopian Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, announced that his country intends to complete work at the Renaissance dam despite the stalled negotiations with neighbouring countries.

However, Addis Ababa says the dam aims to generate electricity for local use and is not intended to negatively impact any of its neighbours.

News article:
Cairo - Khartoum - Mohammed Abdo Hassanein and Mohammed Amin Yassin Talks between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) were marred by disputes for the second consecutive day Wednesday. In two separate statements, the irrigation ministries of Egypt and Ethiopia agreed that talks, which would last until June 13, “did not produce any tangible results.” Cairo placed four conditions during the virtual meeting between the ministers of the three countries, including a call to Addis Ababa to declare it would take no “unilateral action” on filling the dam. The talks were held in the presence of observers from the European Union, the US and South Africa. Observers told Asharq Al-Awsat that the bumpy start of the negotiations and the insistence of Ethiopia not to heed the agreements reached in previous talks in Washington, are signs that there is no solution, and that the crisis is heading towards more escalation. Egypt says the reference for discussions should be the discussions held in Washington during talks brokered by the US and the World Bank in February. Egypt was the only country that initialed the document issued during the talks after the US failed to secure the signatures of Ethiopia and Sudan. Ethiopia has planned to start filling the reservoir of the dam in July. In a statement, the Sudanese irrigation ministry said that during Wednesday’s meetings the three countries expressed their viewpoints. The Egyptian delegation held to the February 21 document as the basis for negotiation, it said. It added that the three countries would continue negotiations to work on a consensual solution. Sudan has rejected a proposal by Ethiopia to sign a partial bilateral agreement for the initial filling of the dam. Nasreddine Allam, former Egyptian Minister of Water Resources, told Asharq Al-Awsat that Egypt’s negotiators would not tolerate Ethiopia’s intransigence and its attempt to bring talks back to square one. Hani Raslan, an expert on Sudan at Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo, hinted at the “failure of the talks.” In a tweet, Raslan wrote that Ethiopia wants to destroy all what has been accomplished by insisting to start filling the dam next month.

News article:
Egypt said on Saturday that the revived negotiations on the disputed Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) are faltering, blaming what it described as Ethiopia’s “intransigence” during the latest meetings between the water ministers of Cairo, Addis Ababa and Khartoum. In statements to reporters, the Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation spokesman said he is not “optimistic about the prospects of achieving a breakthrough during the ongoing negotiations on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.” The signaled collapse of talks comes a few days after Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan began renewed negotiations on the GERD brokered by Khartoum in the latest bid to seal a deal on the controversial dam, after talks stalled last February during US sponsored meetings in Washington. The Washington meetings had resulted in a draft agreement that only Egypt initialed. The latest talks come with a four-day timeframe, from 9 to 13 June, pressed by Cairo to reach an agreement on the filling and operation of the dam. The talks have seen differing statements on Thursday, with Addis Ababa saying there had been an agreement to compare technical documents and to focus on the outstanding points of difference, while Cairo expressed concerns that Addis Ababa was backtracking on previous negotiations. According to the spokesman’s statements on Saturday, Ethiopia presented during Thursday’s meeting what he described as a “deeply troubling document that is both technically unsound and legally inadequate,” despite the “considerable flexibility” by Egypt on a compromise text prepared by Sudan as a possible basis for negotiations. “This document, which both Egypt and Sudan rejected, confirms that Ethiopia lacks the requisite political will to conclude a fair agreement on the GERD and reveals its intention to exploit transboundary water resources in an unrestrained and unregulated manner and without taking into consideration the rights and interests of downstream communities and states,” he said. The “disturbing” Addis Ababa-prepared document would have downstream states “sign-away their riparian rights and recognise an Ethiopian right to exercise unfettered unilateralism both in the use of the Blue Nile and during the filling and operation of the GERD.” Such a document would nullify all agreements made by the three countries in almost a decade of talks, including agreements reached during recent rounds of talks held in the attendance of the US and World Bank, the spokesman said. It provided no guarantees to protect downstream states against possible harm due to the filling and operation of GERD, according to the spokesman, who said that per the document, Addis Ababa would enjoy a right to unilaterally amend rules governing the filling and operation of the dam depending on its energy and water needs without consideration of co-riparians interests. “This text is clearly an attempt to establish a fait accompli. Ethiopia’s position is that Egypt and Sudan should either sign a text that would make them hostages to Ethiopia’s will and whim, or accept Ethiopia’s decision to unilaterally fill the GERD,” he said. The spokesman described the Ethiopian position as “unfortunate and not reflective of the spirit of cooperation and good neighborliness that ought to govern relations between co-riparians and fellow African countries.” The faltering of talks is expected to take its toll further on Cairo and Addis Ababa’s relations, resulting in a constant tug-of-war and accusations over the collapse of talks. The growing conflict in the past months has led to a diplomatic war of words between Cairo and Addis Ababa that landed at the UN Security Council. Cairo had demanded ahead of the meetings last week for a timeframe for the technical talks with Ethiopia and Sudan on the dam, according to a statement by the Egyptian National Security Council chaired by Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi. It said a timeframe for the talks was crucial so as to not allow talks from becoming “a new tool for stalling or evading the obligations of the Declaration of Principles of 2015.” Ethiopia hopes the massive $4.8 billion megaproject on the Blue Nile, which has been under construction since 2011, will allow it to become Africa’s largest power exporter. Egypt receives an annual release of 55.5 billion cubic metres from its High Aswan Dam, while it requires over 80 billion cubic metres to meet its needs. The country bridges the gap by water recycling and reuse. Cairo fears the dam will diminish its water supply from the Nile, on which it relies for the vast majority of its fresh water. The populous country currently has a water share of around 570 cubic metres per person annually, well below the water scarcity level of 1,000 cubic metres per person per year. The figure is expected to drop further to 500 cubic metres by 2025. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
A construction worker walks near the stop log section at Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam as it undergoes construction on the Blue Nile in Guba Woreda, Sept. 26, 2019. (Reuters) Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt said Saturday that tripartite talks with Ethiopia and Sudan over a controversial mega-dam on the River Nile were deadlocked because of Addis Ababa's "intransigence". The Grand Ethiopia Renaissance Dam (GERD) has been a source of tension in the Nile River basin ever since Ethiopia broke ground on it nearly a decade ago. Ethiopia sees the dam as essential for its electrification and development, while Sudan and Egypt view it as a threat to essential water supplies. Mohamed al-Sebaie, spokesperson for Egypt's Water Resources and Irrigation Ministry, said he "is not optimistic about the prospects of achieving a breakthrough during the ongoing negotiations" on the dam in a press release posted to the ministry's Facebook page. This was due to "Ethiopia's intransigence which, once again, became abundantly clear during the ongoing meetings of the ministers of water resources of Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan", he added. The strongly-worded statement follows days of negotiations over the project amid heightened urgency to reach a deal ahead of Addis Ababa's plans to start filling the dam in July. "Ethiopia's position is that Egypt and Sudan should either sign a text that would make them hostages to Ethiopia's will and whim or accept Ethiopia's decision to unilaterally fill the GERD," Sebaie's statement said. Talks between the irrigation and water ministers from the three Nile basin countries resumed Tuesday after a four-month hiatus along with three observers from the United States, European Union and South Africa. After several rounds of failed negotiations, the United States and the World Bank sponsored talks from November 2019 geared towards reaching a comprehensive agreement, after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi put in a request to US President Donald Trump. But the process ran aground after the Treasury Department urged Ethiopia to sign a deal that Egypt backed as "fair and balanced". Ethiopia's water ministry criticized Egypt on Thursday for detailing its grievances over the dam in a May letter to the UN Security Council. The 6,600-kilometer-long (3,900-mile) Nile is a lifeline supplying water and powering electricity in the 10 countries it traverses. Its main tributaries, the White and Blue Niles, converge in the Sudanese capital Khartoum before flowing north through Egypt to drain into the Mediterranean Sea.

News article:
Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt and Sudan said talks over a controversial massive Nile dam would be resumed Monday, amid Egyptian accusations that Ethiopia has sought to scrap “all agreements and deals” they had previously reached, and that “many fundamental issues” remain rejected by Ethiopia, the third party to the talks. The construction of the $4.6 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile, which is over 70 percent complete and promises to provide much-needed electricity to Ethiopia’s 100 million people, has been a contentious point among Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt, the three main Nile Basin countries. The three countries have been holding talks for years, without reaching a deal. Those talks came to an acrimonious halt in Feb. when Ethiopia rejected a US-crafted deal and accused the Trump administration of siding with Egypt. Ethiopia wants to begin filling the dam’s reservoir in the coming weeks, but Egypt has raised concerns that filing the reservoir behind the dam too quickly could significantly reduce the amount of Nile water available to Egypt. After months of deadlock, Sudanese, Egyptian and Ethiopian water and irrigation ministers resumed talks last week, with observers attending from the US, the European Union and South Africa, which is the current head of the African Union. Sudan’s Irrigation Ministry said Saturday’s talks focused on technical matters of the operating of the dam and the filling of its massive reservoir during rainy seasons, droughts and prolonged droughts. It said it will craft a draft paper based on Egyptian and Ethiopian notes to be discussed on Monday. Egypt’s Irrigation Ministry said the June 9-13 talks revealed the differences that remain with Ethiopia. These issues included Ethiopia’s “total” rejection of addressing technical issues related to “the mitigation measures for droughts and prolonged droughts and measures to address prolonged dry years," the ministry statement said. Ethiopia rejected to “the inclusion of a legally binding dispute resolution mechanism," it said. “Egypt reaffirmed that these are essential components in any agreement that relates to an existential matter that affects the lives of over 150 million citizens of Egypt and Sudan,” the statement said. Ethiopia’s Water and Energy ministry said the talks have achieved progress and they will result in “finalizing the process with a win-win outcome.” It said. Mohammed el-Sebaei, a spokesman for Egypt’s Irrigation Ministry, said Ethiopia rejected a Sudanese proposal last week that could be a basis for negotiations between the three countries. Instead, Addis Ababa introduced a “worrisome” proposal that included its vision on the dam’s operation. He said Ethiopia lacks the “political will” to compromise a deal, and wants Egypt and Sudan to “abandon their water rights and to recognize Ethiopia’s right to use the Blue Nile waters unilaterally and to fill and operate the Renaissance Dam in accordance with its vision.” “The proposal is not legally and technically sound,” he told reporters in Cairo. “It is a clear attempt to impose a fait accompli on my downstream country.” Both Egypt and Sudan rejected the Ethiopian proposal, he said. The Ethiopian ministry said el-Sebaei's comments were “regrettable.” The Blue Nile flows from Ethiopia into Sudan where it joins the White Nile near the capital, Khartoum, to form the Nile River. Eighty-five percent of Nile waters originate in Ethiopia from the Blue Nile, which is one of the Nile’s two main tributaries. Egypt last week called for Ethiopia to “clearly declare that it had no intention of unilaterally filling the reservoir” and that a deal that was prepared by the US and the World Bank in February serves as the starting point of the resumed negotiations. The US had crafted a draft deal in February after more than four months of talks, and said the final testing and filling of the dam “should not take place without an agreement.” The deadlock over the dam became increasingly bitter in recent months, with Egypt saying it would use “all available means” to defend “the interests” of its people.

News article:
Egypt may resort to the United Nations Security Council to prevent Ethiopia from taking a "unilateral step" on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), the country's foreign minister announced yesterday. "Egypt has adhered to the approach of negotiating with the Ethiopian side and exercised sincere intentions to reach an equitable agreement for the two parties," Sameh Shoukry told reporters on the sidelines of a Canada Egypt Business Council conference. He added that Addis Ababa was "intransigent and evaded the negotiation". Shoukry pointed out that his country's recent negotiations with Sudan and Ethiopia had not yielded "positive results", adding that Egypt would "consider other options, such as the UN Security Council in order to prevent Ethiopia from taking unilateral action that could negatively affect Egypt's water rights." The dam is the centrepiece in Ethiopia's bid to become Africa's biggest power exporter, but has sparked concerns in Cairo that Egypt's already scarce supplies of Nile waters, on which its population of more than 100 million people is almost entirely dependent, would be further restricted.

News article:
Protesters have gathered outside Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner's home in Washington DC to decry Israeli occupation of the West Bank, but the First Daughter and her family were not there. President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior aide Jared Kushner, who is Jewish, has been leading talks with Israel and debating whether to support Israel's move to annex the disputed territory. The Trump administration remains undecided on Israeli annexation. Demonstrators with IfNotNow, a progressive American Jewish group that opposes Israel's occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, wore masks as they rallied outside the couple's lavish home Kalorama on Tuesday afternoon.

More than 1,000 people on Friday took part in weekly anti-corruption protests outside the Prime Minister’s Residence in Jerusalem. Media reports put attendance at some 1,000-2,000 participants. Activists called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign, accused him of holding the country hostage to his criminal trial, and of prioritizing his fight with the justice system over the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Netanyahu’s trial on charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes opened in May in a Jerusalem court. The accusations include accepting some $200,000 in gifts such as cigars and champagne from two billionaires, Hollywood-based Israeli movie mogul Arnon Milchan and Australian magnate James Packer. Netanyahu is also accused of offering to push legislation benefiting powerful Israeli media moguls in exchange for more positive coverage in their publications. Netanyahu has said he is the victim of a wide-ranging conspiracy and called the allegations baseless, saying accepting gifts from friends isn’t a problem.

News article:
Tel Aviv resident Ruti Arenfeld says she’s attending the protest in Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square to show solidarity with many of her friends who have lost their jobs as a result of the government’s crippling restrictions aimed at curbing the pandemic. “I’m not here to make a political statement. There are some who are trying to make this about Bibi’s corruption, but I think that’s a mistake,” she says as a man walks by her with a poster reading “corrupt ones go home,” next to a picture of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “I’m here to call on the government to do what it has promised. To transfer the money to the wage workers and small businesses,” continues Arenfeld. “You told them to close and they did that. Now it’s your turn to help them before it’s too late,” she adds. While organizers billed the demonstration as apolitical, some of the protesters chant, “Bibi [Netanyahu], go home,” in what appears to represent the sentiment among many of the participants. Dozens of police officers are roaming in and around Rabin Square, with some of them playing a pre-recorded message asking protesters to abide the government’s coronavirus guidelines by remaining two meters apart from one another and wearing masks. — Jacob Magid

News article:
Deputy Health Minister Yoav Kisch on Sunday condemned a mass protest in Tel Aviv against the government’s economic policies during the COVID-19 pandemic as a “health terror attack,” while an opposition lawmaker accused the police minister of “siccing” officers on demonstrators during clashes following the rally. Some 10,000 people took part in a demonstration Saturday evening in Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square, railing against what they say is insufficient financial support to Israelis hurt economically by government lockdown measures to contain the virus. The protest, the largest demonstration in Israel since the start of the pandemic, was held as the country copes with a surge in new coronavirus infections, leading the government to reintroduce tight restrictions on gatherings and economic activity. Kisch, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, said he recognized “the extent of the economic crisis,” but said he was committed to preventing gatherings to curb the spread of the virus. “We’re doing everything to prevent gatherings and are paying a high price (socially and economically) in order to stop the virus and then [we] see images from the square yesterday. A mega health terror attack,” he wrote on Twitter. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Finance Minister Israel Katz, however, defended the protest, after saying Saturday that there was no reason to demonstrate as the government had not lost control of the economy. “Demonstrations are part of democracy… to express protest is legitimate. I think it is mainly aimed at the previous months in which people felt that the [financial] assistance wasn’t adequate,” he said Sunday in an interview with Radio 103FM. Katz, who along with Netanyahu met with protest organizers Friday in an apparent bid to convince them to call off the rally, was asked whether he believed the demonstration was put together by political opponents of the premier. Advertisement “I don’t think that’s the case,” he said. “Later on, apparently, I heard about some very harsh comments.” Katz seemed to be referring to demonstrators who after the rally blocked roads and clashed with police at several locations. Videos on social media showed scuffles between cops and protesters as some chanted “Bibi go home,” using the prime minister’s nickname. Police in some cases used officers on horseback and pepper spray to disperse crowds. Twenty people were arrested. Yesh Atid-Telem MK Moshe Ya’alon lashed out Sunday at Public Security Amir Ohana, another Likud party ally of Netanyahu, over the police response. “The minister for Netanyahu’s security is siccing police against anti-regime protesters. This is what a dictatorship looks like,” he wrote on Twitter. Ya’alon was previously a Likud lawmaker and served as defense minister under Netanyahu, but has become a vocal critical of the prime minister in recent years. Advertisement On Sunday, some of the organizers of the Rabin Square rally distanced themselves from the protests that took place afterwards, during which some trash cans were set ablaze and a rock was thrown through the window of a bank. “We’re against violence. The demonstration was exemplary until the end,” Shai Birman, who heads an organization of restaurant and bar owners, told Channel 12 news. He also said, however, that “the writing was on the wall.” “The Israeli government has been ignoring the public in Israel for over half a year already. It reached a breaking point and a crisis of confidence between the nation and its leader. This crisis of confidence is unrelated to the rally. It has been incubating for a long time and yesterday it erupted,” he said. ההפגנה מחריפה – מפגינים ניפצו באבנים את דלת הכניסה של בנק דיסקונט באבן גבירול @GLZRadio pic.twitter.com/fpaRk46ohU — ליה ספילקין | Lia Spilkin (@LiaSpilkin) July 11, 2020 Saturday’s protest came as Israel faces unemployment of some 21 percent, or 850,000 people, with many saying they are fearful for their future and with numerous businesses facing collapse. Advertisement There has been widespread anger from various sectors of the economy whose members say the government is not doing enough to help them weather the crisis, accompanied by outrage over the alleged misdirection of financial aid and the bureaucratic complexities of obtaining assistance. Jobless Israelis say government promises of financial support in recent months through grants, unemployment stipends and various other aid mechanisms have in some cases failed to come through and in others proven woefully inadequate in addressing their plight. As Israel contends with the alarming surge in coronavirus cases in recent weeks, Netanyahu has faced a tide of criticism over the government’s handling of the economic fallout of the pandemic, with polls indicating growing disapproval of his stewardship of the economy.

Deputy Health Minister Yoav Kisch on Sunday condemned a mass protest in Tel Aviv against the government’s economic policies during the COVID-19 pandemic as a “health terror attack,” while an opposition lawmaker accused the police minister of “siccing” officers on demonstrators during clashes following the rally. Some 10,000 people took part in a demonstration Saturday evening in Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square, railing against what they say is insufficient financial support to Israelis hurt economically by government lockdown measures to contain the virus. The protest, the largest demonstration in Israel since the start of the pandemic, was held as the country copes with a surge in new coronavirus infections, leading the government to reintroduce tight restrictions on gatherings and economic activity. Kisch, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, said he recognized “the extent of the economic crisis,” but said he was committed to preventing gatherings to curb the spread of the virus. “We’re doing everything to prevent gatherings and are paying a high price (socially and economically) in order to stop the virus and then [we] see images from the square yesterday. A mega health terror attack,” he wrote on Twitter. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Finance Minister Israel Katz, however, defended the protest, after saying Saturday that there was no reason to demonstrate as the government had not lost control of the economy. “Demonstrations are part of democracy… to express protest is legitimate. I think it is mainly aimed at the previous months in which people felt that the [financial] assistance wasn’t adequate,” he said Sunday in an interview with Radio 103FM. Katz, who along with Netanyahu met with protest organizers Friday in an apparent bid to convince them to call off the rally, was asked whether he believed the demonstration was put together by political opponents of the premier. Advertisement “I don’t think that’s the case,” he said. “Later on, apparently, I heard about some very harsh comments.” Katz seemed to be referring to demonstrators who after the rally blocked roads and clashed with police at several locations. Videos on social media showed scuffles between cops and protesters as some chanted “Bibi go home,” using the prime minister’s nickname. Police in some cases used officers on horseback and pepper spray to disperse crowds. Twenty people were arrested. Yesh Atid-Telem MK Moshe Ya’alon lashed out Sunday at Public Security Amir Ohana, another Likud party ally of Netanyahu, over the police response. “The minister for Netanyahu’s security is siccing police against anti-regime protesters. This is what a dictatorship looks like,” he wrote on Twitter. Ya’alon was previously a Likud lawmaker and served as defense minister under Netanyahu, but has become a vocal critical of the prime minister in recent years. Advertisement On Sunday, some of the organizers of the Rabin Square rally distanced themselves from the protests that took place afterwards, during which some trash cans were set ablaze and a rock was thrown through the window of a bank. “We’re against violence. The demonstration was exemplary until the end,” Shai Birman, who heads an organization of restaurant and bar owners, told Channel 12 news. He also said, however, that “the writing was on the wall.” “The Israeli government has been ignoring the public in Israel for over half a year already. It reached a breaking point and a crisis of confidence between the nation and its leader. This crisis of confidence is unrelated to the rally. It has been incubating for a long time and yesterday it erupted,” he said. ההפגנה מחריפה – מפגינים ניפצו באבנים את דלת הכניסה של בנק דיסקונט באבן גבירול @GLZRadio pic.twitter.com/fpaRk46ohU — ליה ספילקין | Lia Spilkin (@LiaSpilkin) July 11, 2020 Saturday’s protest came as Israel faces unemployment of some 21 percent, or 850,000 people, with many saying they are fearful for their future and with numerous businesses facing collapse. Advertisement There has been widespread anger from various sectors of the economy whose members say the government is not doing enough to help them weather the crisis, accompanied by outrage over the alleged misdirection of financial aid and the bureaucratic complexities of obtaining assistance. Jobless Israelis say government promises of financial support in recent months through grants, unemployment stipends and various other aid mechanisms have in some cases failed to come through and in others proven woefully inadequate in addressing their plight. As Israel contends with the alarming surge in coronavirus cases in recent weeks, Netanyahu has faced a tide of criticism over the government’s handling of the economic fallout of the pandemic, with polls indicating growing disapproval of his stewardship of the economy.

News article:
Hundreds of people demonstrated outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem on Friday, demanding that he resign over his indictment on corruption charges. It was the third such demonstration this week at the junction of Gaza Street and Balfour Street, the road where the Prime Minister’s Residence is located. A previous protest, attended by several thousand people on Tuesday, turned violent and dozens were arrested during clashes with police. Many of the protesters turned up in bathing suits and with beach towels in a dig at the Netanyahu government’s decision in principle to shut beaches from next weekend, saying his government is not only corrupt, but also chaotic and inept. Protesters held up signs, saying “A tsunami is coming” and pictures of dead fish with the caption the “stench of corruption.” Police blocked off parts of Gaza Street. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Among those taking part in the protest was former IDF chief of staff Dan Halutz. “Enough is enough,” he told the Walla news site. “I hope that the defendant who is sitting only a few hundred meters from here is listening.” “Before he destroys the country, we need to get him out of his position. His priority is defending himself and as far as he is concerned the country can burn and all the people can starve,” Halutz said. Advertisement The demonstration followed protests on Tuesday and Thursday. Although organizers had called for protesters to spend Thursday night sleeping on the sidewalk, police warned that the demonstration must end on time at 11 p.m. and that participants would not be permitted to sleep on the street. Nevertheless, about 100 people spent the night at the site. Organizers called the rallies a “Siege of Balfour” and said the event was also to protest the government’s plans to introduce weekend lockdowns and ban public gatherings as part of the efforts to halt the spread of the coronavirus. “Preventing public gatherings and applying a lockdown is only intended to free Netanyahu from the siege,” organizers said in a statement reported Thursday by Walla. Justice Minister Avi Nissenkorn indicated Friday that protests would still be able to go ahead despite any lockdown measures. Advertisement This weekend, there are no new restrictions on movement and beaches will remain open, subject to social distancing. But a tighter weekend lockdown is likely to take effect from Friday, July 24, including restrictions on movement. As of July 24, beaches are also set to be closed on weekends. While protests Thursday and Friday were relatively calm and ended without any reports of violent incidents, the memory of Tuesday’s clashes with police remained vivid in the minds of some protesters. “Tuesday was insane, huge, historic. We can’t recreate it, even if we wanted to. It was unreal. It was important to experience it to understand what happened,” said Sasha, a 19-year-old Jerusalem resident. “At one point I needed to hide behind an announcement board with a bunch of other people to avoid being attacked by cops on horseback. It was terrifying,” Sasha said. Thursday’s protest, by contrast, had an almost carnivalesque atmosphere. Young people intending to sleep at the protest, wearing pajamas and clutching teddy bears, sat in meditation circles on the ground. A handful of circus performers entertained the crowd by spewing fire from their mouths. An activist at the protest told The Times of Israel that she was planning a dawn yoga session for the sit-in. “Police came here today prepared for a violent protest. There were almost 20 police cars on the street by the afternoon, which was something that didn’t happen earlier, and they’ve erected those barricades on either side. But they’ve found instead a protest with very strong, positive energy,” Shimon, 59, told The Times of Israel. On Tuesday night, police used water cannons and officers mounted on horses to disperse several hundred people who blocked the Jerusalem light rail system after midnight, following a large protest outside the official residence. Several thousand people had gathered Tuesday evening calling on Netanyahu to quit over his indictment on corruption charges, as several separate social protests took place at the same time across the country. Advertisement Some of the demonstrators attempted to break through security barriers at the scene and clashed with police. As the protest ended, hundreds moved downtown, where they blocked the light rail system, chanting “shame, shame” and “Bibi [the prime minister’s nickname], go home.” Police then turned water canons on the demonstrators and mounted police charged up and down the light rail tracks on Jaffa Street, sending protesters scattering to the side of the streets before regrouping. Many then marched down Keren HaYesod Street, with some pushing garbage dumpsters and chain-link fences into the streets as makeshift barricades. Several dumpsters were set on fire. Police said one officer was lightly wounded and 50 protesters were arrested. The Jerusalem demonstrations are part of the ongoing “black flag” anti-corruption protests against Netanyahu, who is standing trial in a series of graft cases. Demonstrations have been held regularly around the country, with protesters waving signs reading “crime minister” and calling for Netanyahu to resign. Netanyahu faces charges of fraud and breach of trust in three separate cases, as well as bribery in one of them. He has denied wrongdoing and claimed the charges are part of an effort by political opponents, the media, law enforcement and prosecutors to remove him from office.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli police used water cannons to disperse demonstrators around Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence on Saturday as protests mounted against him over alleged corruption and his handling of the coronavirus crisis. Slideshow ( 4 images ) Hit by high unemployment, a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases and reimposed coronavirus curbs, Israelis have taken to the streets in almost daily demonstrations against the government. Public anger has been compounded by corruption alleged against Netanyahu, who went on trial in May for bribery, fraud and breach of trust - charges he denies. In Jerusalem hundreds gathered outside the prime minister’s residence and then marched through the streets, calling for Netanyahu’s resignation as police used water cannons to disperse the crowds. At least two people were arrested, police said. In Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial hub, thousands gathered at a rally by the beach, demanding better state aid to businesses hurt by coronavirus restrictions and to people who have lost jobs or have been put on unpaid leave. Unemployment presently stands at 21%. Israel’s Reshet TV News said police in Tel Aviv used tear gas to try to disperse the demonstrators who had marched through the streets. It broadcast footage of scuffles with police. Police said arrests were under way at that demonstration. Israel reopened schools and many businesses in May, lifting restrictions that had flattened an infection curve after a partial lockdown imposed in March. But with the infection rate rising sharply in the past few weeks, many public health experts said the government had moved too fast while neglecting to take the necessary epidemiological steps to control the pandemic once the economy reopened. A poll by the nonpartisan Israel Democracy Institute on Tuesday found only 29.5% of the public trust Netanyahu’s handling of the crisis. Netanyahu has announced numerous economic aid packages, some of which have been slow to come through while others have drawn criticism for being ineffective. Israel, with a population of 9 million, has reported almost 50,000 coronavirus cases and 400 deaths.

News article:
By Yoni Weiss YERUSHALAYIM — Protesters calling for the ouster of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu gathered in Yerushalayim and Tel Aviv on Motzoei Shabbos. These demonstrations turned violent, and police arrested some 30 people. In Yerushalayim, a demonstration that began in front of the Prime Minister’s residence fanned out to the city center. The police pushed them back while arresting 15 of the rioters. The police used water cannons against the crowds. The demonstrators had a mixture of messages, including charges that Netanyahu was harming Israel’s democracy, that he was on trial for criminal charges and therefore should step down, and that he had failed in his leadership during the coronavirus crisis. The Black Flag movement, which organized the events, stated that “the scenes we are seeing across the country are the result of a dysfunctional government and the results are disastrous. The economic catastrophe that this government is creating poses an existential threat to the State of Israel as we know it. “The citizens of the country deserve a functioning prime minister who is only concerned with the problems of the citizens and not with survival,” the movement spokespeople added. In Tel Aviv, protesters marched from the beach to Habima Square in the center of the city. They blocked roads, clashed with the police while throwing objects at them, attempted to break through the perimeter set by the police, and sprayed officers with pepper spray. Some set trashcans on fire. At least 13 rioters were arrested in Tel Aviv. Five of the people arrested during demonstrations in Yerushalayim were released Sunday, but given restraining orders to keep them away from the Prime Minister’s Residence until July 28. A sixth person has been sent to house arrest for five days. These protests were the latest in several such events that took place in recent days with the demonstrators vowing to continue with their campaign to unseat Netanyahu. On Sunday, Netanyahu criticized the left-wing demonstrators who waved Palestinian Authority flags during protests outside his official residence in Yerushalayim. “The Palestinian Authority flag at a left-wing demonstration organized by Ehud Barak – what a shame and disgrace,” Netanyahu tweeted following the demonstration.

Thousands of Israelis took part in a rally Tuesday outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem, with some demonstrators railing against the government’s handling of the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and others calling for the premier to resign over his indictment on graft charges. The protest was organized by several groups, including restaurant owners angry at the repeated closures forced upon them in recent months, self-employed Israelis who say government support has been insufficient, and the so-called “black flag” anti-corruption protesters against Netanyahu. Additionally, some demonstrators protested against proposed legislation that would allow government measures against the coronavirus to take effect without Knesset approval, saying it would remove vital oversight. Many of the protesters marched from the Prime Minister’s Residence to the Knesset after receiving police permission. A small number of Netanyahu supporters held a counter-demonstration nearby and police closed off several roads around the Prime Minister’s Residence due to the protests. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Hebrew-language media outlets put turnout for the rallies at some 2,000. Adjacent to the Prime Minister’s Residence, restaurateurs handed out food to passersby in protest of restrictions on eateries. Earlier Tuesday, the Knesset’s Coronavirus Committee reversed a cabinet decision that would bar restaurants from serving patrons on site, limiting them to takeout and delivery.

Thousands of Israelis took part in a rally Tuesday outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem, with some demonstrators railing against the government’s handling of the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and others calling for the premier to resign over his indictment on graft charges. The protest was organized by several groups, including restaurant owners angry at the repeated closures forced upon them in recent months, self-employed Israelis who say government support has been insufficient, and the so-called “black flag” anti-corruption protesters against Netanyahu. Additionally, some demonstrators protested against proposed legislation that would allow government measures against the coronavirus to take effect without Knesset approval, saying it would remove vital oversight. Many of the protesters marched from the Prime Minister’s Residence to the Knesset after receiving police permission.

News article:
In a televised national address on Wednesday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu laid out parts of an economic-stimulus package intended to ease the financial burden of the ongoing coronavirus crisis. Yet in addition to outlining parts of a plan for jumpstarting the economy, Netanyahu addressed a growing phenomenon of left-wing civil unrest. “The conspiracy industry exists in Israel; it is simply unbelievable. I heard about a public representative who is calling for a civil rebellion,” he stated. The “public representative” is head of the opposition Yair Lapid. Not only is he agitating public demonstrations, but he has repeatedly warned that aggrieved citizens could turn violent. In an interview with Reuters week, Lapid stated that: “We are talking to people who are becoming more and more desperate and angry, who feel, and rightly so, that the country has deserted them at their hardest hour.” “We are trying to be responsible … to calm things down, telling people, ‘You know violence is not the answer,’ ” he said. “But it’s getting harder by the day … I sympathise with the anger and I also worry about the possibility of violence as a result of this anger. What I am trying to do is not to encourage it but to raise a red flag as to what might happen.” A few days earlier, Lapid told Maariv, “It is going towards violence. People are in despair because they don’t have what to eat.” Just days after Lapid’s remarks, more than 10,000 Israelis joined a protest in Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square on Saturday night against the government’s handling of the economic fallout of the pandemic. Almost on cue, the protest turned violent with various acts of vandalism, including the setting ablaze of garbage dumpsters. A brick was thrown through the window of a local bank branch. Three officers were lightly injured, and 12 protesters were arrested. While Saturday night’s protest was the largest to date over the past several months, it was not limited only to financially aggrieved small business owners and recently unemployed Israelis. Rather, it was the most recent installment of an ongoing series of “black flag” protests led by Israel’s political opposition, aimed specifically at destabilizing a nation already weathering health and financial crises. Various protests have focused on protecting democracy, protecting the environment, protecting Israel’s Supreme Court, opposing Israel’s application of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria, and most prominently, dealing with Netanyahu’s criminal proceedings. Printed posters at nearly all of the protests accuse Netanyahu of being the “Crime Minister.” On Tuesday night, just three days after the larger Tel Aviv event, a separate smaller protest outside the prime minister’s residence in Jerusalem—themed around Netanyahu’s criminal proceedings—turned violent. Fifty protesters were arrested. The prime minister’s residence has been the stage of multiple protests over the past several weeks. One of the protest organizers, former Israeli Air Force Gen. Amir Haskel, who was arrested for disturbing the peace at a protest two weeks ago, recently told The Media Line that “I took to the streets for the first time back in 2016,” over what he called Netanyahu’s “attacks on the democratic foundations of Israel.” “We have one demand, which is that Netanyahu resign,” said Haskel. He explained the tactics of recruiting Israelis disenfranchised over other issues and joining with them, stating, “We cooperate with all of these movements, and gladly.” One of Haskel’s fellow protesters, Sadi Ben Shitrit, who began protesting “about two years ago,” said that “dictatorships are never toppled in the parliament or in the government. They’re toppled in the streets.” He insisted that “it’s a matter of a few months. He can’t stay. Pretty soon his own base, when they get hungry [because of the pandemic and resulting high unemployment], they’ll come out against him. It’ll be chaos in the streets.” Yet Ben Shitrit also mimicked some of the most disturbing political discourse of the past several months, stating, “They can only shut me up in one way: with a bullet to the head. If that’s what it takes, I’m willing to pay that price.” These shocking statements are part of an ongoing theme of hateful and dangerous speech that has gone on for months without censure. At another protest outside the prime minister’s residence, protester Haim Shadmi was accused of threatening the life of Netanyahu’s son Yair. Protesters blasted a recording outside the residence saying of Netanyahu’s son, “We know why you need bodyguards, one day we will find you when they are away, [that would be] a pity!” At the time, the prime minister filed a formal complaint with police stating “the incitement among the radical left crossed all red lines. These are real threats to the life of my son, threats that cannot be ignored.” Lapid responded to Netanyahu’s complaint, tweeting, “Netanyahu is filing all these complaints because this is his method: To threaten, incite, lead to violence and then claim he’s a victim. Always playing the victim and whining.” Back in May, when Netanyahu’s trials first began, Lapid said: “There was a coup attempt yesterday, and it was led by Netanyahu. He tried to attack the police, the prosecution, the courts, the media. He tried to threaten his judges. The moment he drags his ministers to the court with him, incites his followers, tries to lead us towards a civil war, then he can’t be allowed to remain in office.” “Israel changed yesterday. It won’t be the same. A serving prime minister was put on trial. His trial didn’t start with a presentation of the evidence, it started with wild incitement against the rule of law, against the courts … ,” said Lapid. “He knows it will end in violence, but he doesn’t care.” Lapid’s opposition partner, far-left Meretz Party chair Nitzan Horowitz, similarly accused Netanyahu of “incitement” for questioning the legitimacy of the unprecedented legal cases against Israel’s longest-serving premier. “The inciters, led by Netanyahu, must know that if God forbid blood is spilled here, they’ll be responsible,” stated Horowitz. This dangerous rhetoric did not start with Netanyahu’s trial. It was a constant theme of his (and then political ally turned foe Benny Gantz) electoral attempt to unseat Netanyahu. After the prime minister warned against the left-wing’s plans to form a minority government with self-proclaimed anti-Zionist Arab parties, Lapid stated: “The words coming out of Netanyahu’s mouth in the past few days are incitement to violence. They are words spoken by followers of Baruch Goldstein, not by a prime minister. It will end badly. He knows it will end badly. He’s been there.” Goldstein was a Jewish doctor who murdered 29 Arabs and injured 125 others while inside a mosque at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron in 1994. Back in November, when Gantz was still running together with Lapid, the prime ministerial challenger spoke at a rally commemorating the 24th anniversary of the murder of Yitzhak Rabin. The former prime minister was assassinated at the same site as last week’s “financial” protests. At the memorial, he, too, subversively accused Netanyahu of stirring incitement that could lead to bloodshed. “Twenty-four years, Yitzhak Rabin is no longer with us, but incitement raises its ugly head … and hatred has again become a dangerous weapon in the hands of politicians without limits,” said Gantz. These dangerous sentiments, which have now become commonplace in Israel’s political dialogue, do not represent in any way the sentiments of everyday Israelis. And with the exception of the financial protest in Tel Aviv, which managed to successfully recruit normal Israelis hurt by the financial damage of coronavirus restrictions, most of the protests are attended primarily by radicals whose political views sit at the far-left fringe of Israel’s diverse political spectrum. Pictures of the protests do not show proud Israelis hurt by the coronavirus, but anarchists seeking to destabilize Israel in the same way manner that recent racial protests turned violent in the United States. And while Netanyahu has correctly warned against the dangers of a minority left-wing government backed by Arab parties and questioned the legality of the criminal proceedings against him, he has never called for—or even mentioned—the possibility of violence. While rolling out his financial stimulus this week, he stated, “I want you to understand: Israel is a free democracy. Freedom of expression and protest are reserved for every person and group, certainly in times of economic distress such as this. But the revolt … this is real danger,” adding that the recent scenes in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem are “not just a protest, that is legitimate. We saw violence against police and against civilians. This violence deserves all condemnation.” He warned that Israelis “must not talk about civil rebellion. We cannot fall into gratuitous hatred. We cannot fall into hating our brothers. … We cannot go there. We must behave in exactly the opposite manner. We must deepen the unity between us. We must watch our own. I believe that with joint forces, we will fight the coronavirus and defeat it.” Reprinted with author’s permission from Jewish News Syndicate

News article:
Dozens of people were arrested late Thursday and early Friday as police deployed water cannons against protesters urging the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outside of his residence in Jerusalem. The protest drew thousands of Israelis angry at government corruption, the handling of the coronavirus crisis and other ills to the capital’s Paris Square Thursday evening, the latest in a series of rallies that have ratcheted pressure on Netanyahu and his governing coalition. Police said 55 demonstrators were arrested or detained as officers attempted to clear the area. Officers sprayed protesters with high-pressure water cannons in a bid to move people off the streets after midnight. Some protesters who were peacefully dispersing were shot in the back by the water cannons, and activists said police left them with nowhere to go. “We left the protest quietly, without violence… They told us we couldn’t disperse on the sidewalk, nor in the park. We headed down the street, but apparently not fast enough for them. They started spraying us from behind,” Dekel, a demonstrator, told The Times of Israel.

In an attempt to escape the water, some demonstrators entered Independence Park, where mounted police moved at them in an attempt to force them to stay in the road. Protesters who remained on the road, however, were drenched by the water cannons roaming up and down Agron Street, which bounds the park on one side. “I live here, and they won’t let me get to my home,” said Miel, 23. She was told to take a roundabout way home and was then hit by the water cannons anyway. She has been to previous protests, but told The Times of Israel that she did not remember such an extensive use of water cannons at those. Advertisement Dozens of officers eventually marched into Independence Park, dragging out individual protesters and arresting them before allowing the last clusters of huddling demonstrators to leave the scene. “Despite the legitimate protest by many participants, who dispersed on their own, protesters [remained] who refused to disperse after police declared several times that the demonstration had ended and asked protesters to leave on their own, and so police were forced to act to disperse them and restore public order,” a police spokesperson said in a statement. Anti-Netanyahu protesters have been holding regular rallies outside his official residence on Jerusalem’s Balfour Street, calling on the premier to resign due to his indictment on corruption charges. Rallies against Netanyahu’s economic policies during the coronavirus pandemic have also been held, though mostly in Tel Aviv. There have been occasional scenes of violence at recent protests, and police were reportedly wary of further clashes. Protesters have also accused police of using excessive force during the demonstrations. Police put the number of protesters at 4,000, according to the Ynet news site. Demonstrators held signs with slogans including, “We won’t stop fighting for the state,” “I have no other land,” and “Fed up with corruption.” Yotam, a 27-year-old Hebrew University student, said this was his fourth time attending the anti-government rallies. Advertisement “I feel like this government is cheating us. They’re telling us a story which serves one man in power,” Yotam said. Noga, a Haifa native who now lives in Jerusalem, told The Times of Israel that the most important thing for her now was for the country to be unified. “We can see that the behavior of the government right now is dividing the country. That’s why it’s important for me to be here,” Noga said. The protest drew a wide array of demonstrators, from hippies distributing flowers, to a self-proclaimed Likud voter who opposes Netanyahu, to Hadash activists calling for an end to Israel’s military occupation of the West Bank. One idea, however, seemed to unite every protester in the square: that the current government must not remain in power. “What I want most is for this whole government to go home. All of them? Yes, all of them,” said Nati, a 40-year-old Tel Aviv resident. A number of female protesters at the rally removed their shirts and held up signs with the words “tits photograph better than…” followed by various words written on their chests, including “occupation” and “police violence.” One held a sign calling for “Justice for Iyad,” in reference to Iyad Halak, an autistic Palestinian man killed by police in Jerusalem in late May. Their act appeared to be inspired by a protester who raised a firestorm by removing her shirt on Tuesday while on a menorah statue near the Knesset. A small counter-protest of Netanyahu supporters was also held nearby. Advertisement Among those who came out were members of the La Familia Beitar Jerusalem soccer hooligan club, Hebrew media reported. Haaretz reported that some anti-Netanyahu protesters said they were attacked by members of the gang: “There were four people from La Familia who yelled ‘It’s a shame that Hitler didn’t finish the job,’ and ‘You don’t deserve someone like Bibi, you deserve someone like Hitler.’ Then a bigger group approached me and I started filming them, pushed me and knocked my phone out of my hand,” one left-wing activist was quoted saying. A video shared shared by Channel 13’s Tal Shorrer also showed the group singing a song in praise of Yitzhak Rabin assassin Yigal Amir. עכשיו בהפגנת לה פמיליה סמוך לבית ראש הממשלה: שיר ההלל ליגאל עמיר: ״ולפתע פתאום כתם דם באדום לא רוצים הסכם שלום לאה רבין רבין זונה איזה הלם קיבלה נפטרה והלכה יגאל עמיר..(נחתך)״ (ההמשך של השיר: ..תודה רבה, יושב בתא בלי חרטה) pic.twitter.com/5G4opLBnsb — Tal Shorrer (@TalShorrer) July 23, 2020 Police had granted permission for the protests to continue until 11 p.m., with acting police chief Motti Cohen urging the sides to “maintain a protest free of violence and unrest and to adhere to police instructions.” The two crowds were separated by several hundred meters, with a large number of policemen on scene to keep them apart and to protect the premier’s residence on Balfour street. The streets around the demonstrations were blocked to traffic. Advertisement Netanyahu in a Thursday night press conference on the coronavirus, held during the protest, said to the demonstrators: “Don’t drag the state into anarchy, violence, and destruction of property. Don’t drag it into attacks on police; they’re doing their jobs.” Anti-Netanyahu protests have been going on for several years, led by a core group of older protesters, but in recent weeks have drawn in a younger cohort. The financial crisis and soaring unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic seem to have provided the impetus for younger people to join their elders on the streets. Amir Haskel, a former Israeli Air Force general who has become a prominent figure in the anti-Netanyahu protests, told Ynet: “Tonight’s protest is a protest of young people. We expect very many of them and hope that the protest ends without violence.” The organizers said in a statement: “Thousands of young people that are coming out to protest are not victims of the coronavirus — they’re victims of the [governmental] corruption of Benjamin Netanyahu.” Demonstrations against Netanyahu, which organizers dubbed the “Siege of Balfour,” took place near his residence on several nights last week. The events have veered between a carnivalesque atmosphere, with circus performers and meditation circles, and violence, including a controversial incident Tuesday night when a police officer was filmed and photographed digging his knee into the neck of a protester. Israel’s spiraling coronavirus crisis, and the economic effects of its second wave, have ratcheted up tensions in the country and caused a steep drop in Netanyahu’s approval ratings.

News article:
Dozens of people were arrested late Thursday and early Friday as police deployed water cannons against protesters urging the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outside of his residence in Jerusalem. The protest drew thousands of Israelis angry at government corruption, the handling of the coronavirus crisis and other ills to the capital’s Paris Square Thursday evening, the latest in a series of rallies that have ratcheted pressure on Netanyahu and his governing coalition. Police said 55 demonstrators were arrested or detained as officers attempted to clear the area. Officers sprayed protesters with high-pressure water cannons in a bid to move people off the streets after midnight. Some protesters who were peacefully dispersing were shot in the back by the water cannons, and activists said police left them with nowhere to go. “We left the protest quietly, without violence… They told us we couldn’t disperse on the sidewalk, nor in the park. We headed down the street, but apparently not fast enough for them. They started spraying us from behind,” Dekel, a demonstrator, told The Times of Israel.

In an attempt to escape the water, some demonstrators entered Independence Park, where mounted police moved at them in an attempt to force them to stay in the road. Protesters who remained on the road, however, were drenched by the water cannons roaming up and down Agron Street, which bounds the park on one side. “I live here, and they won’t let me get to my home,” said Miel, 23. She was told to take a roundabout way home and was then hit by the water cannons anyway. She has been to previous protests, but told The Times of Israel that she did not remember such an extensive use of water cannons at those. Advertisement Dozens of officers eventually marched into Independence Park, dragging out individual protesters and arresting them before allowing the last clusters of huddling demonstrators to leave the scene. “Despite the legitimate protest by many participants, who dispersed on their own, protesters [remained] who refused to disperse after police declared several times that the demonstration had ended and asked protesters to leave on their own, and so police were forced to act to disperse them and restore public order,” a police spokesperson said in a statement. Anti-Netanyahu protesters have been holding regular rallies outside his official residence on Jerusalem’s Balfour Street, calling on the premier to resign due to his indictment on corruption charges. Rallies against Netanyahu’s economic policies during the coronavirus pandemic have also been held, though mostly in Tel Aviv. There have been occasional scenes of violence at recent protests, and police were reportedly wary of further clashes. Protesters have also accused police of using excessive force during the demonstrations. Police put the number of protesters at 4,000, according to the Ynet news site. Demonstrators held signs with slogans including, “We won’t stop fighting for the state,” “I have no other land,” and “Fed up with corruption.” Yotam, a 27-year-old Hebrew University student, said this was his fourth time attending the anti-government rallies. Advertisement “I feel like this government is cheating us. They’re telling us a story which serves one man in power,” Yotam said. Noga, a Haifa native who now lives in Jerusalem, told The Times of Israel that the most important thing for her now was for the country to be unified. “We can see that the behavior of the government right now is dividing the country. That’s why it’s important for me to be here,” Noga said. The protest drew a wide array of demonstrators, from hippies distributing flowers, to a self-proclaimed Likud voter who opposes Netanyahu, to Hadash activists calling for an end to Israel’s military occupation of the West Bank. One idea, however, seemed to unite every protester in the square: that the current government must not remain in power. “What I want most is for this whole government to go home. All of them? Yes, all of them,” said Nati, a 40-year-old Tel Aviv resident. A number of female protesters at the rally removed their shirts and held up signs with the words “tits photograph better than…” followed by various words written on their chests, including “occupation” and “police violence.” One held a sign calling for “Justice for Iyad,” in reference to Iyad Halak, an autistic Palestinian man killed by police in Jerusalem in late May. Their act appeared to be inspired by a protester who raised a firestorm by removing her shirt on Tuesday while on a menorah statue near the Knesset. A small counter-protest of Netanyahu supporters was also held nearby. Advertisement Among those who came out were members of the La Familia Beitar Jerusalem soccer hooligan club, Hebrew media reported. Haaretz reported that some anti-Netanyahu protesters said they were attacked by members of the gang: “There were four people from La Familia who yelled ‘It’s a shame that Hitler didn’t finish the job,’ and ‘You don’t deserve someone like Bibi, you deserve someone like Hitler.’ Then a bigger group approached me and I started filming them, pushed me and knocked my phone out of my hand,” one left-wing activist was quoted saying. A video shared shared by Channel 13’s Tal Shorrer also showed the group singing a song in praise of Yitzhak Rabin assassin Yigal Amir. עכשיו בהפגנת לה פמיליה סמוך לבית ראש הממשלה: שיר ההלל ליגאל עמיר: ״ולפתע פתאום כתם דם באדום לא רוצים הסכם שלום לאה רבין רבין זונה איזה הלם קיבלה נפטרה והלכה יגאל עמיר..(נחתך)״ (ההמשך של השיר: ..תודה רבה, יושב בתא בלי חרטה) pic.twitter.com/5G4opLBnsb — Tal Shorrer (@TalShorrer) July 23, 2020 Police had granted permission for the protests to continue until 11 p.m., with acting police chief Motti Cohen urging the sides to “maintain a protest free of violence and unrest and to adhere to police instructions.” The two crowds were separated by several hundred meters, with a large number of policemen on scene to keep them apart and to protect the premier’s residence on Balfour street.

News article:
YERUSHALAYIM (AP) — After a night of intense protests against Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and his government, dozens of Israeli demonstrators chained themselves together and briefly blocked the entrance to the Knesset on Wednesday morning. Police arrested four and broke up the gathering, which was called to protest an upcoming vote to grant the government sweeping authority to bypass parliament in enacting measures to combat the rapid spread of the coronavirus. But it came amid a fresh outpouring of discontent with Netanyahu. Protests outside Netanyahu’s residence have become a weekly occurrence, with police increasingly taking harsher measures against demonstrators. Last month, they arrested a retired Israeli air force general, setting off an uproar. The protests have since drawn a younger crowd and have grown more defiant. In the past week, thousands of Israelis have participated in some of the largest demonstrations in nearly a decade against the long-time prime minister, as public discontent bubbled over. Netanyahu has come under growing criticism for holding office while on trial for corruption, pushing for seemingly anti-democratic measures under the guise of combating the virus and mismanaging the country’s deepening economic crisis. On Tuesday night, a large coalition of protest groups combined to march through the streets of Jerusalem from Netanyahu’s official residence to the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. They beat drums, banged on pots and blared on trumpets while calling for the prime minister’s resignation and holding banners reading, “the Israeli spring is here” a reference to the “Arab spring” of the early 2010s. Thirty-four people were arrested during clashes with police.

Israeli security forces blasted protestors with water cannons as thousands held demonstrations against their prime minister across the country on Saturday. A main protest took place in west Jerusalem outside Benjamin Netanyahu's official residence.

News article:
Following controversy over the deployment of water cannons to disperse demonstrators calling for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s resignation at a demonstration Thursday night, police waited longer and used somewhat different tactics to disperse Saturday’s anti-Netanyahu crowds. At least 5,000 demonstrators gathered to call for the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in front of the Prime Minister’s Residence in Jerusalem, the largest protests seen since the rallies began two weeks ago. (Channel 13 put the Jerusalem turnout at 10,000, and said it was the largest demonstration of its kind to date.) Earlier in the day, protesters also gathered on around 250 overpasses across the country, as well as in front of Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea. Police repeatedly stipulated that the demonstrators in Jerusalem, who filled Paris Square near the Prime Minister’s Residence, could continue to protest until 11 p.m. when they would be ordered to disperse. But thousands of demonstrators remained in the square past the deadline on Saturday, cheering as the clock struck 11. The police force, which has been criticized for what some say is excessive use of force during previous rallies, waited until later in the night than usual to forcefully compel protesters to clear the area. Police sources told Channel 12 news that they had no intention of using stronger tactics against demonstrators, despite the reported pressure of Public Security Minister Amir Ohana. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms More than an hour and a half after the deadline had passed, the vast majority of protesters had left the square, leaving several hundred who seemed determined to remain until police dispersed them. Unlike Thursday, Jerusalem police still did not publicly declare the demonstration illegal and order protesters to leave the scene. The operation to clear the square on Saturday night began at around 1 a.m. Rather than inaugurate the dispersal by blasting protesters with a water cannon, as on previous nights, Jerusalem police instead opted to first surround the crowd as they stood in Ben Maimon Street in front of a police barricade. Dozens of riot police, known in Hebrew as Yassam, repeatedly entered the crowd, pushing demonstrators aside, to drag out individual protesters, sometimes aggressively and seemingly at random. Some of those dragged out appear to have been immediately released without being detained. Advertisement Police later said 12 people were detained or arrested for “various offenses included disturbing public order or attacking other protesters.” The number seemingly included members of a pro-Netanyahu group reportedly detained for beating up activists leaving the Jerusalem rally. (This compared with 55 arrests at Thursday night’s demonstration.) Ranks of Yassam officers broke the demonstration in two, as officers closer to the Prime Minister’s Residence began pushing the crowd away. A Magen David Adom medic pleaded with officers to be allowed through to reach demonstrators farther down the street, but were refused access. Four mounted police arrived behind the Yassam officers and charged demonstrators, riding up onto the sidewalks and forcing the crowd back into Paris Square. When some demonstrators still refused to leave, two water cannons were deployed on the scene, sending protesters fleeing down Agron Street. At least a hundred riot police followed them; at times it seemed as though there were as many Yassam officers as protesters walking in two waves away from the square. As police pushed protesters down Agron Street in a mass, the crowd began chanting slogans again as the remnants of the demonstration coalesced again into a march. As riot police watched in formation from higher up the street, the two water cannons rolled down Agron Street and fired on protesters again, sending blasts into alleys where some demonstrators were attempting to take shelter from the high-pressure water behind dumpsters. “Despite legitimate protest by most protesters, who dispersed voluntarily, a handful of protesters remained who refused to disperse after the police repeatedly announced the end of the protest and asked the protesters to leave voluntarily. The police were eventually forced to disperse them and restore public order,” the Jerusalem Police said in a statement. Advertisement Oren, a 28-year-old Jerusalem resident who has attended several demonstrations at Paris Square, said that he had seen an overall escalation in the police’s use of force from protest to protest. “It becomes an attempt to suppress the protesters, to threaten them and to scare them, so they won’t even want to protest in the first place,” Oren said. While police have used water cannons at several protests since the mass demonstrations began two weeks ago, a video published by Channel 12 brought renewed controversy over the tactic. The video showed a water cannon firing directly at a protester’s head during a demonstration last week, and striking him in the face with a blast of high-pressure water, his head snapping back violently as he was thrown to the ground. Targeting the heads of protesters with water cannons violates police procedure, which state that “at no point are water cannons to spray in the direction of protesters’ heads for fear of traumatic injury to sensitive areas.”

Hundreds of Israelis on Wednesday once again protested in front of prime minister's home in Jerusalem by reading the prayer of Tisha B'Av, an annual fast day on which a number of disasters in Jewish history occurred, including the distruction of the biblical temples. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Israelis have been demonstrating in front of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's official residence for weeks, calling on the leader to resign over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak and the ongoing corruption trial. 3 View gallery A sitting rally in Jerusalem ( Photo: Yoav Dudkevitch ) The protest was organized by "Darkenu," Israel's largest non-partisan civil society movement. The group's CEO, Yair Fink, said the protest symbolizes how today's Israel is being destroyed just like the two temples. "We came here tonight to make sure our beloved home is not destroyed again," he said. "Our previous home was destroyed because of corruption, extremism and violence and we, the moderate majority, must stand up, take to the streets and defend our home." Among the demonstrators was the grandson of former Prime Minister Levi Eshkol, who served as Israeli leader from 1963 to 1969. "Netanyahu has forgotten what it's like to be an Israeli," said Nevo Eshkol. 3 View gallery A sitting rally in Jerusalem ( Photo: Yoav Dudkevitch ) Retired Brig. Gen. Amir Haskel, who has been the leader of the protest movement against Netanyahu, spoke at the rally, telling the crowd the rift in the Israeli society is "deep and difficult." "The foundations of the third temple are being undermined," he said. "It is not a day for reckoning, it is a day for awakening, it is a day for self-observation, for soul-searching. It is up to us to change our reality. It will not be easy and quick, but it needs to start here and now." 3 View gallery Anti-government rally at Tel Aviv's Rabin Square ( Photo: Courtesy of ) A smaller but similar rally was held at Rabin Square in Tel Aviv, where on Tuesday a group of anti-Netanyahu protesters had been violently attacked.

"A group of ten people dressed in black, began attacking the protesters with knives, batons and glass bottles," he told Ynet. "I ran to help the wounded and then I was attacked myself with a sharp object.

News article:
TEL AVIV (JTA) — Noam Ofer might have been an unlikely candidate to join Israel’s burgeoning protest movement. At 76, he is older than most of the people who have taken to the streets in recent weeks to protest the government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. He also doesn’t share the political views of many of the protesters. But Ofer was there anyway on Tuesday evening marching outside the Tel Aviv home of Israel’s internal security minister in charge of law enforcement, Amir Ohana, who was caught on tape pressuring a senior police official to ban demonstrations against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “He’s trying to illegally shut down protests,” Ofer said. “I came because the minister said that we’re all on the left. I’m on the right. He said we are anarchists, but the only ones creating anarchy are the ones around Netanyahu.” Ofer’s perspective reflects the deep and bipartisan frustration that many Israelis are feeling about the country’s leadership nearly six months since Israel recorded its first coronavirus case. Thousands of Israelis have been staging loud protests for weeks, mostly outside the prime minister’s residence in Jerusalem, but also in Tel Aviv and other spots across the country. Some commentators have called it the country’s largest grassroots movement since 2011, when hundreds of thousands of Israelis protested the cost of living. After drawing international praise for how he efficiently imposed a strict and effective lockdown, Netanyahu acknowledged earlier this month to reopening Israel too soon. Cases have risen sharply, restrictions have been reimposed and unemployment is near its all-time high. Stimulus checks from the government have fallen short of their promised amount. Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s trial on three corruption charges has been delayed for a second time — after Ohana, in his previous stint as justice minister, shut down courts amid the pandemic in March, effectively postponing legal proceedings against the prime minister. The demonstrations have reenergized those who have been calling out Netanyahu in recent years over his legal problems and what they perceive as his goal to weaken democratic institutions like the judiciary. The result is a movement made up of Israelis across the political spectrum, whose numbers seem to be growing every week. Police were bracing for large rallies Thursday night with the end of the Tisha B’Av observance. As the protests have widened in focus, demonstrators have faced harsh crackdowns by police, who have drawn criticism for using water cannons and tear gas. Many at Tuesday evening’s protests, which was organized by the anti-Netanyahu Black Flag movement, said they were incensed by Ohana’s statement to Doron Yadid, the commander of the Jerusalem police district — a recording of which was leaked in the media — that he didn’t “understand why we don’t ban” anti-Netanyahu protests. “I want to challenge the ruling of the court,” Ohana said, referring to a recent ruling allowing the protests to go ahead, generating widespread anger and prompting President Reuven Rivlin to issue a public statement declaring that the right to protest “must not be harmed.” Ohana is “trying to cancel protests and circumvent the law,” complained Maor, a 25-year-old law student from the coastal city of Ashdod who said he had attended a number of demonstrations outside the prime minister’s residence and had been “subject to police violence” for engaging in civil disobedience. “It was brutal, they used a water cannon against me,” he said, describing how he was shot with a high pressure water jet while participating in a sit-in. “I bruised my ankle. I couldn’t work for two days.” Another protester, Eliana Barbel, showed off a large bruise on the back of her leg as she described her experience at a protest last week that ended in violent clashes with police. “I was arrested on Thursday. I was hit and arrested and spent the night in jail for protesting,” Barbel said. “When I was arrested, the cops were very violent. I was sitting on the ground and three riot policemen picked me up and took me. “They want to scare us, but this will only bring more people out,” she added, holding up a sign decrying violence against Arabs, haredi Orthodox, Ethiopians and leftists, and promising to continue to protest even “if I’m arrested 10 times.” Echoing a theme that has emerged in recent American Black Lives Matter protests that have faced police crackdowns, Efrat Safran, a 57-year-old dual American-Israeli citizen from Ramat Hasharon, carried a sign bearing the slogan “Mothers Against Police Violence.” Safran said she was ready to protect younger protesters from the police with her own body. “We’re trying to save democracy,” she said. While the crowd protesting near Ohana’s apartment was overwhelmingly secular, Pinchas, 30, a haredi attorney from Bnei Brak, a largely ultra-Orthodox city, said he decided to come out because “government corruption is dangerous to all of us, including the haredim.” Tuesday night’s protest was marked by tense but not violent exchanges with police. (Five protesters reportedly were hospitalized after being attacked, the Black Flag movement said, by individuals not associated with the police.) After several hours, the protesters drifted away from the zone marked out for them by law enforcement and began marching down a nearby road, stopping traffic and eventually running into a line of policemen backed up by mounted officers. Large groups of protesters eventually began making their way back, trying to circumvent the police and reach Ohana’s apartment building, leading to several clashes during which officers shoved several people, leading to renewed chants of “no to violence.” As police and protesters faced off, the mounted officers repeatedly rode up to the edge of the crowd trying to force its members back. Most of the marchers began to walk through the city, snarling traffic as they made their way through a series of Tel Aviv landmarks, including the square in front of the Habima Theater and the popular Dizengoff Center shopping mall.

News article:
Israel is roiling with angry street protests that local observers have warned could erupt into open civil strife – a development Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be encouraging. For weeks, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv have been the scene of large, noisy demonstrations outside the official residences of Mr Netanyahu and his public security minister, Amir Ohana. On Saturday night around 13,000 marched through Jerusalem shouting "Anyone but Bibi", Mr Netanyahu's nickname. Their calls were echoed by tens of thousands more at locations across the country. Turnout has been steadily growing, despite attacks on demonstrators from both the police and Mr Netanyahu’s loyalists. The first protests abroad by Israeli expats have also been reported. Demonstrators protest against Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outside his residence in Jerusalem on Saturday. AP Photo The protests, in defiance of physical distancing rules, are unprecedented by Israeli standards. They have bridged the gaping political divide between a small constituency of anti-occupation activists – disparagingly called “leftists” in Israel – and the much larger Israeli Jewish public that identifies politically as on the centre and the right. For the first time, a section of Mr Netanyahu’s natural supporters is out on the streets against him. In contrast to earlier protests, such as a large social justice movement that occupied the streets in 2011 to oppose rising living costs, these demonstrations have not entirely eschewed political issues. The target of the anger and frustration is decidedly personal at this stage – focused on the figure of Mr Netanyahu, who is now Israel’s longest-serving Prime Minister. Protesters have renamed him Israel’s “crime minister”. But also fuelling the protests is a larger mood of disenchantment as doubts grow about the state’s competence to deal with multiple crises unfolding in Israel. The virus has caused untold social and economic misery for many, with as much as one fifth of the labour force out of work. Mr Netanyahu’s supporters in the lower middle-classes have been hit hardest. Now well into a second wave, Israel has a per capita rate of infection that outstrips even the US. The shadow of a renewed lockdown amid government mishandling of the virus has undermined Mr Netanyahu's claim to be "Mr Security". Protesters have renamed Benjamin Netanyahu Israel’s 'crime minister'. EPA There are concerns too about police brutality – starkly highlighted by the killing in May of an autistic Palestinian, Eyad Hallaq, in Jerusalem. Police crackdowns on the protests, using riot squads, undercover agents, mounted police and water cannon, have underlined not just Mr Netanyahu’s growing authoritarianism. There is a sense too that the police may be ready to use violence on dissenting Israelis that was once reserved for Palestinians. After manipulating his right-wing rival, the former military general Benny Gantz, into joining him in a unity government in April, Mr Netanyahu has effectively crushed any meaningful political opposition. The agreement shattered Mr Gantz’s Blue and White party, with many of his legislators refusing to enter the government, and has widely discredited the ex-general. Mr Netanyahu is reportedly preparing for a winter election – the fourth in two years – both to cash in on his opponents’ disarray and to avoid honouring a rotation agreement in which Mr Gantz is due to replace him late next year. According to the Israeli media, Mr Netanyahu may find a pretext for forcing new elections by further delaying approval of the national budget, despite Israel facing its worst financial crisis in decades. And, of course, overshadowing all this is the matter of the corruption charges against Mr Netanyahu. Not only is he the first sitting Prime Minister in Israel to stand trial, but he has been using his role and the pandemic to his advantage, including by delaying court hearings. Expand Autoplay Israelis protest against the government's response to the financial fallout of the coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) crisis at Rabin square in Tel Aviv, Israel. REUTERS In a time of profound crisis and uncertainty, many Israelis are wondering which policies are being pursued for the national good and which for Mr Netanyahu’s personal benefit. The government's months-long focus on the annexation of swaths of Palestinian territory in the West Bank has looked like political pandering to his settler constituency, creating a dangerous distraction from dealing with the pandemic. Similarly, a one-off handout this week to every Israeli – over the strenuous objections of finance officials – looks suspiciously like an electoral bribe. As a result, Mr Netanyahu is facing a rapid decline in support. A recent survey shows trust in him has fallen by half – from 57 per cent in March and April, when the Covid-19 pandemic began, to 29 per cent today. Many Israelis increasingly see Mr Netanyahu less as a father figure and more as a drain on resources from the body politic. Capturing the popular mood is a new art work called the "Last Supper" that was covertly installed in central Tel Aviv. It shows Mr Netanyahu alone, gorging on a vast banquet by stuffing his hand into an enormous cake decorated with the Israeli flag. A doll depicting Benjamin Netanyahu sits on a table simulating the 'Last Supper' during a protest performance by Israeli artist Itay Zalait in Tel Aviv last week. AFP Quote Observers have wondered whether the protests can transcend party political tribalism and develop into a grassroots movement demanding real change In another move designed to highlight the case against Mr Netanyahu, better-off Israelis have been publicly organising to donate this week’s state handout to those in need. Mr Netanyahu’s repeated incitement against the protesters – disparaging them as “leftists” and “anarchists”, and suggesting they are spreading disease – appears to have backfired. It has only rallied more people to the street. But the incitement and Mr Netanyahu’s claims that he is the true victim – and that in the current climate he faces assassination – have been interpreted as a call to arms by some on the right. Last week five protesters were injured when his loyalists used clubs and broken bottles on them, with police appearing to turn a blind eye. Further attacks were reported at the weekend. Protest organisers said they had begun arranging defence units to protect demonstrators. Mr Ohana has called for a ban on the protests and urged a heavy hand from the police. He has delayed appointing a new police chief – a move seen as incentivising local commanders to crack down on the protests to win favour. Large numbers of protesters have been forcefully arrested, with reports that police have questioned some on their political views. Observers have wondered whether the protests can transcend party political tribalism and develop into a grassroots movement demanding real change. That might widen their appeal to even more disadvantaged groups, not least the one fifth of Israel’s citizens who belong to its Palestinian minority. But it would also require more of the protesters to start drawing a direct connection between Mr Netanyahu’s personal abuses of office and the wider, systemic corruption of Israeli politics, with the occupation its beating heart. That may yet prove a tall order, especially when Israel feels it can resist external pressure for change. Jonathan Cook is a freelance journalist in Nazareth

Israeli Police Forcefully Disperse Protesters Outside PM's Residence By VOA News August 02, 2020 Israeli police used force to disperse protesters gathered outside the official residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Sunday morning. Several thousand demonstrators had been rallying at the square in central Jerusalem since Saturday evening. The Jerusalem protest was one of the largest turnouts since demonstrations calling for Netanyahu to resign began. The anti-Netanyahu protests have been the largest in Israel since the 2011 demonstrations against the country's high cost of living. Smaller gatherings took place in the capital Tel Aviv and near Netanyahu's beach house in central Israel. Eventually, police forcefully cleared the square, carrying away protesters who were refusing to leave. There have been no reports of any arrests.

News article:
Massive demonstrations across Israel are calling for the unseating of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over corruption cases and his alleged mishandling of the coronavirus crisis. Worryingly for Netanyahu, the protests are growing, and look set to get even bigger, fuelled by hate speech and violence from his supporters and police. According to Israeli media, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in Tel Aviv and other cities. The police have been removing them forcibly, while those who manage to stay behind face being pepper sprayed by pro-Netanyahu gangs and, some reports claim, beaten up by them. At the same time, his political opponents are involved in a fierce battle with Netanyahu over his handling of the protests. Some, even from the right-wing, are threatening to bring down the coalition government. The alternate Prime Minister Benny Gantz, from the left of centre Blue and White, Netanyahu's coalition partner, commented on the violent crackdown on the demonstrators: "As a government, we are obliged to be attentive to the people. As the regime, we bear the responsibility of facilitating holding the demonstrations and to protect the demonstrators who, regrettably, were attacked yesterday once again at several locations. The right to protest is the life's breath of democracy, and violence erodes the foundation of democracy." This sends a clear message to Netanyahu, calling on him and the police to abandon violence against the demonstrators. "Nobody restricts the demonstrations," insisted the Prime Minister, while also accusing them of being "coronavirus incubators". Israel's Netanyahu accused of promoting fake death threats to garner sympathy Haaretz reported that the right-wing Yamina alliance is threatening to embarrass Netanyahu's Likud party by planning to present a bill that would allow the Knesset to override High Court rulings. The alliance apparently seeks to "lure" right-wing MKs to break the coalition's discipline or "embarrass them by forcing them to vote against it." Other bills from right and left aim to "rattle" the coalition. Meanwhile, Israel is facing a crisis related to its credit agencies' rating due to the ongoing conflict within the coalition over the approval of a very short-term budget for the rest of 2020 or a two-year budget for 2020 and 2021. While Netanyahu and his camp are insisting on a short-term budget, the others, led by Blue and White, are fighting for the two-year proposal. Added to this is the financial cost of the coronavirus pandemic, which is hurting large economies and strong states, so what must it be doing to Israel? Last week, the global rating agency Fitch downgraded the sovereign debt outlook of the United States to negative. Haaretz did not rule out that the reasons which led to this downgrading would also apply to Israel, which is blundering through the pandemic under Netanyahu's leadership. "If the government has not approved the 2021 budget by the end of this year," the chief economist at Bank Leumi, Gil Bufman, told Haaretz, "Israel may be added to the rating agencies' watch list, increasing the risk that their Israeli outlook will be lowered to negative… The political situation is not sending good signals vis-à-vis management of fiscal policy and and it's fair to assume that this will manifest itself in the credit agencies' report." In Yedioth Ahronoth, journalist Nahum Barnea pointed out that: "Israel needs a talented leader, not a magician, a servant or a lord; it needs a person who is not chased by his criminal cases. Is Netanyahu, despite all of his virtues, able to meet all of these conditions? For me, it is likely that even his supporters would not be able to give a positive answer to this question." The message that the protesters are sending is clear, he added: "Democratic countries cannot depend on one person." Speaking to right-wing Israeli journalist Baruch Yedid, who is close to Netanyahu, I was told that the demonstrations and increasing tension within the coalition could bring about the end of the government. Citing internal polls for Likud, Yedid said that Netanyahu's popularity has decreased from 42 or 44 per cent to just 32. He also expects the coalition government to end very soon, which means yet another General Election could be on the way. "The world is taking one way and Israel is taking another way," he concluded. That is Israel's democracy.

Massive demonstrations across Israel are calling for the unseating of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over corruption cases and his alleged mishandling of the coronavirus crisis. Worryingly for Netanyahu, the protests are growing, and look set to get even bigger, fuelled by hate speech and violence from his supporters and police. According to Israeli media, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in Tel Aviv and other cities. The police have been removing them forcibly, while those who manage to stay behind face being pepper sprayed by pro-Netanyahu gangs and, some reports claim, beaten up by them. At the same time, his political opponents are involved in a fierce battle with Netanyahu over his handling of the protests.

News article:
Thousands of protesters gather in Paris Square, near the Prime Minister’s official residence in Jerusalem, to demand the resignation of Netanyahu in the latest in a series of ongoing protests against the premier. Tonight’s protest appears to be largest of the recent demonstrations against Netanyahu so far — the Kan public broadcaster and Ynet news outlet put the number of attendees at around 15,000. Last Saturday’s protest drew 10,000, according to police, although organizers said that was a low estimate. Other protests are being held at Netanyahu’s private home in Caesarea and on bridges and traffic junctions around the country. Demonstrators flooded the area around the Prime Minister’s Residence, with protesters closely packed up and down the intersection. Some chant “Bribery, fraud, breach of trust,” a reference to the criminal charges against Netanyahu, while others call for a “revolution.” There are large numbers of families with children at tonight’s rally, in addition to the typical groups of young people. For the first time in several weekends, no separate protest of independent workers suffering from the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic is being held in Tel Aviv. Organizers instead called for a single, unified demonstration to be held near Netanyahu’s Jerusalem residence. Many demonstrators hold handmade signs decrying what they say is a detached government and ask Netanyahu to “Let my people go.” One group of protesters builds a papier-mache submarine — a reference to a corruption allegation against the premier (which was not part of the criminal investigations against Netanyahu) — and carry it through the crowd. At least two bands perform at opposite ends of the demonstration, a rare sight since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, while groups of young people dance to protest songs blasting out of a speaker on Keren HaYasod Street. Advertisement Michael Cordoba, 41, holds a sign saying, “Left and right refuse to be enemies.” Cordoba, who identifies as right-wing, says that Netanyahu survives “by dividing us.” “There are so many reasons why we should be able to work together,” he says. Cordoba says he is optimistic about the protests after tonight’s turnout. “The more people come, the more they inspire to follow them,” he says. –Aaron Boxerman

News article:
Thousands of Israelis gathered Saturday evening in protests against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as part of ongoing demonstrations over his indictment on corruption charges and handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The main protest took place outside the Prime Minister’s Residence in Jerusalem, where anti-Netanyahu rallies have been held regularly in recent months. Hebrew media reports put turnout at over 15,000 people, while organizers estimated the crowd at some 32,000 people, based on number of armbands given out to demonstrators as they entered the square. Hundreds of police officers were deployed at the scene. The demonstration appeared to be the largest yet of a growing movement that has seen thousands take to streets to rally against Netanyahu over the past month. Smaller protests were also held in Caesarea outside Netanyahu’s private residence, and at highway overpasses nationwide. The number of families with children was especially prominent at the Jerusalem demonstration, in addition to the groups of young people. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Many activists dressed up as extraterrestrials, in mocking homage to the prime minister’s son Yair Netanyahu, who earlier in the week derided the protesters as “aliens.” Representatives of independent businesspeople joined the protest, as no separate demonstration of those battered economically by the pandemic was held. Organizers instead called for a single, unified demonstration to be held at the Prime Minister’s residence. Many demonstrators held handmade signs decrying what they say is a detached government and calling on Netanyahu to “Let my people go.” One group of protesters built a papier-mache submarine — in reference to a massive corruption case involving the purchase of naval vessels that ensnared associates of Netanyahu but not the premier himself — and carried it through the crowd. Advertisement At least two bands performed at opposite ends of the demonstration, a rare sight since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, while groups of young people danced to protest songs blasting out of a speaker on Keren HaYasod Street. Michael Cordoba, 41, held a sign saying “left and right refuse to be enemies.” Cordoba, who identified himself as right-wing, said that Netanyahu survives politically “by dividing us.” There are so many reasons why we should be able to work together,” he said, adding that he was optimistic about the protests after Saturday’s evening turnout. “The more people come, the more they inspire to follow them.” Police in Jerusalem allowed protesters to remain until after midnight, but began demanding demonstrators disperse starting at around 12:30 a.m. Sunday, removing those who refused to leave by force amid chants of “no violence,” and “shame.” The square was cleared out by 1:30 a.m., with three people being detained for “disturbing public order and attacking officers,” according to police. A Haaretz photographer was also briefly held despite showing his press credentials. A police spokesperson accused the photographer of attacker an officer. Another rally was held near Netanyahu’s private home in the coastal town of Caesarea, with estimates of up to 1,000 participants. Advertisement Ahead of the main rallies, smaller protests were held at bridges and highway overpasses across the country. המחאה נגד נתניהו: מפגינים החלו להתאסף על גשרים במוקדים שונים ברחבי הארץ@daniel_elazar pic.twitter.com/uIqVESPxvG — כאן חדשות (@kann_news) August 8, 2020 Like in past weeks, Netanyahu and his Likud party lashed at Channel 12, Israel’s leading broadcaster, for covering the protests. “All over the world, the media and countries are acting for the citizens, while our reporters and analysts are mobilizing for ‘Demonstration Channel 12’ for the benefit of left-wing riots against the government that is fighting for the lives and livelihoods of the citizens of Israel,” Likud said in a statement shared by Netanyahu on social media. “It will not help them. We will continue to work for you and we will win.” At a protest in the Red Sea coastal city of Eilat, protesters said tear gas was sprayed at them from a vehicle that drove past. Police at the rally were also hit by the gas, the Walla news site reported. Police said they were investigating the incident. “This incident is a direct result of the incitement by the defendant Netanyahu,” protest organizers said in a statement. Advertisement Earlier Saturday, protesters filed a police complaint against Yona Avrushmi, the killer of left-wing activist Emil Grunzweig, after he called them “germs” in a television interview and suggested that counter-demonstrators “know exactly what to do” about them. The complaint was lodged by a member of the Crime Minister group, one of the three main groups organizing the protests against Netanyahu. The group also sent an urgent letter to Acting Police Commissioner Motti Cohen urging that Avrushmi be arrested immediately. Avrushmi, who in 1983 lobbed a hand grenade into a left-wing rally, killing Grunzweig and wounding nine others — among them former Labor Party minister Avraham Burg and Likud minister Yuval Steinitz — told a Channel 12 interviewer in a clip aired on Friday that the protesters are “germs, there’s no argument there… they spread diseases and must be kept away from society.” Calling them “evil people” and “haters of Israel,” he said: “I hate them and they hate me.” Avrushmi, who lives in Tel Aviv, said he has no plans to “go to Balfour” to see the protests against Netanyahu but “some young guys are going, and they know what to do, they know exactly what to do.” Avrushmi was handed a life sentence for the murder and served 27 years in prison before his release in 2011. During a police interrogation after the murder, Avrushmi was quoted as telling officers that the peace activists protesting at the time were “germs that must be eliminated.” The Crime Minister group demanded that Avrushmi be arrested to “send a clear message of deterrence and zero tolerance to the young people he encouraged.” The group also criticized Channel 12 for broadcasting the interview. Advertisement Netanyahu and his supporters have strongly condemned the protesters, branding them “anarchists,” and accusing them of alleged incitement against the premier and his family. He has also protested media coverage of the protests, which he claims blows them out of proportion. In their statement, the Crime Minister group said it was clear that Avrushmi admires Netanyahu and suggested that the premier’s serious comments were being echoed by the convicted killer. The name of the group is borrowed from a popular slogan at the growing anti-Netanyahu rallies, and references his legal troubles. The premier is on trial for a series of cases in which he allegedly received lavish gifts from billionaire friends and traded regulatory favors with media moguls for more favorable coverage of himself and his family. He has denied any wrongdoing, accusing the media and law enforcement of a witch hunt to oust him from office. Along with those at the demonstrations calling on the premier to resign due to his indictment on corruption charges, people protesting the government’s economic policies during the coronavirus pandemic have joined the rallies, with crowds in the thousands and rising. More limited protests calling on Netanyahu to resign were held outside Netanyahu’s Jerusalem residence on Thursday and on Friday night. Recent weeks have seen some incidents of violence by right-wing supporters of Netanyahu. Protesters have also accused police of using excessive force during the demonstrations. According to Channel 12 news, a pro-Netanyahu activist attacked a protester outside the Prime Minister’s Residence on Friday and another posted, then deleted, a clip on Facebook saying opponents of the demonstrations should bring weapons to the rallies. On Thursday, police told the High Court of Justice that it believed it should reject a petition against the demonstrations by dozens of residents of Jerusalem neighborhoods Rehavia and Talbieh, who are seething over the weekly protests near their homes. Siding with the demonstrators, police told the court that any attempts to curtail the rallies, held several times weekly, would impinge on the freedom to protest. Police said they would therefore not place a cap on the number of participants, or relocate the protests elsewhere. The force also rebuffed a call to restrict the rallies due to health fears amid the coronavirus pandemic.

A Haaretz photographer was also briefly held despite showing his press credentials. A police spokesperson accused the photographer of attacker an officer.

We will continue to work for you and we will win.” At a protest in the Red Sea coastal city of Eilat, protesters said tear gas was sprayed at them from a vehicle that drove past. Police at the rally were also hit by the gas, the Walla news site reported. Police said they were investigating the incident. “This incident is a direct result of the incitement by the defendant Netanyahu,” protest organizers said in a statement. Advertisement Earlier Saturday, protesters filed a police complaint against Yona Avrushmi, the killer of left-wing activist Emil Grunzweig, after he called them “germs” in a television interview and suggested that counter-demonstrators “know exactly what to do” about them. The complaint was lodged by a member of the Crime Minister group, one of the three main groups organizing the protests against Netanyahu. The group also sent an urgent letter to Acting Police Commissioner Motti Cohen urging that Avrushmi be arrested immediately. Avrushmi, who in 1983 lobbed a hand grenade into a left-wing rally, killing Grunzweig and wounding nine others — among them former Labor Party minister Avraham Burg and Likud minister Yuval Steinitz — told a Channel 12 interviewer in a clip aired on Friday that the protesters are “germs, there’s no argument there… they spread diseases and must be kept away from society.” Calling them “evil people” and “haters of Israel,” he said: “I hate them and they hate me.” Avrushmi, who lives in Tel Aviv, said he has no plans to “go to Balfour” to see the protests against Netanyahu but “some young guys are going, and they know what to do, they know exactly what to do.” Avrushmi was handed a life sentence for the murder and served 27 years in prison before his release in 2011. During a police interrogation after the murder, Avrushmi was quoted as telling officers that the peace activists protesting at the time were “germs that must be eliminated.” The Crime Minister group demanded that Avrushmi be arrested to “send a clear message of deterrence and zero tolerance to the young people he encouraged.” The group also criticized Channel 12 for broadcasting the interview. Advertisement Netanyahu and his supporters have strongly condemned the protesters, branding them “anarchists,” and accusing them of alleged incitement against the premier and his family. He has also protested media coverage of the protests, which he claims blows them out of proportion. In their statement, the Crime Minister group said it was clear that Avrushmi admires Netanyahu and suggested that the premier’s serious comments were being echoed by the convicted killer. The name of the group is borrowed from a popular slogan at the growing anti-Netanyahu rallies, and references his legal troubles. The premier is on trial for a series of cases in which he allegedly received lavish gifts from billionaire friends and traded regulatory favors with media moguls for more favorable coverage of himself and his family. He has denied any wrongdoing, accusing the media and law enforcement of a witch hunt to oust him from office. Along with those at the demonstrations calling on the premier to resign due to his indictment on corruption charges, people protesting the government’s economic policies during the coronavirus pandemic have joined the rallies, with crowds in the thousands and rising. More limited protests calling on Netanyahu to resign were held outside Netanyahu’s Jerusalem residence on Thursday and on Friday night. Recent weeks have seen some incidents of violence by right-wing supporters of Netanyahu. Protesters have also accused police of using excessive force during the demonstrations. According to Channel 12 news, a pro-Netanyahu activist attacked a protester outside the Prime Minister’s Residence on Friday and another posted, then deleted, a clip on Facebook saying opponents of the demonstrations should bring weapons to the rallies. On Thursday, police told the High Court of Justice that it believed it should reject a petition against the demonstrations by dozens of residents of Jerusalem neighborhoods Rehavia and Talbieh, who are seething over the weekly protests near their homes. Siding with the demonstrators, police told the court that any attempts to curtail the rallies, held several times weekly, would impinge on the freedom to protest. Police said they would therefore not place a cap on the number of participants, or relocate the protests elsewhere. The force also rebuffed a call to restrict the rallies due to health fears amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Thousands of Israelis gathered Saturday evening in protests against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as part of ongoing demonstrations over his indictment on corruption charges and handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The main protest took place outside the Prime Minister’s Residence in Jerusalem, where anti-Netanyahu rallies have been held regularly in recent months. Hebrew media reports put turnout at over 15,000 people, while organizers estimated the crowd at some 32,000 people, based on number of armbands given out to demonstrators as they entered the square. Hundreds of police officers were deployed at the scene. The demonstration appeared to be the largest yet of a growing movement that has seen thousands take to streets to rally against Netanyahu over the past month. Smaller protests were also held in Caesarea outside Netanyahu’s private residence, and at highway overpasses nationwide. The number of families with children was especially prominent at the Jerusalem demonstration, in addition to the groups of young people.

Police and municipal inspectors clashed on Sunday with demonstrators as they cleared a protest site near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence for a fifth time. The encampment was part of the ongoing “black flag” anti-corruption protests against Netanyahu, who is standing trial in a series of graft cases and is additionally facing criticism for his government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Protesters said officers forcibly took equipment and confronted some 50 people who had spent the night at the encampment, including families with children, the Haaretz daily reported.

Netanyahu ally and Public Security Minister Amir Ohana was recorded last month pressuring police brass to step up enforcement against demonstrators, saying they are “taking over the sidewalks with sleeping bags and mattresses.” The encampments are part of the black flag movement which led demonstrations on Saturday evening against Netanyahu as part of ongoing protests.

Hundreds of people gathered Friday evening in protests against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as part of ongoing demonstrations over his indictment on corruption charges and handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Demonstrators said they would not let Thursday’s news of the historic normalization agreement reached between Israel and the United Arab Emirates distract from Netanyahu’s failures. “This agreement does not make our government any more functional, this agreement does not make the prime minister any less corrupt, this agreement, above all, will not make us go away,” protester Eli Brook told the crowd. About 1,000 people attended the weekly Friday protests, which are called “Kabbalat Shabbat,” and tend to attract more young families than the larger Saturday night protests, which have frequently seen clashes between protesters and police. About 100 others protested outside Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Protesters have long been holding regular rallies outside the Prime Minister’s Residence on Balfour Street in Jerusalem, as well as in Tel Aviv and other areas, calling on the premier to resign due to his indictment on corruption charges. They have been joined in recent weeks by people protesting the government’s economic policies during the coronavirus pandemic, with crowds in the thousands and rising. Netanyahu is on trial for a series of cases in which he allegedly received lavish gifts from billionaire friends and traded regulatory favors with media moguls for more favorable coverage of himself and his family.

The demonstration appeared to be the largest yet of a growing movement that has seen thousands take to streets to rally against Netanyahu over the past month. Smaller protests were also held in Caesarea outside Netanyahu’s private residence, and at highway overpasses nationwide. The number of families with children was especially prominent at the Jerusalem demonstration, in addition to the groups of young people. Many activists dressed up as extraterrestrials, in mocking homage to the prime minister’s son Yair Netanyahu, who earlier last week derided the protesters as “aliens.” Representatives of independent businesspeople joined the protest, as no separate demonstration of those battered economically by the pandemic was held. Organizers instead called for a single, unified demonstration to be held at the Prime Minister’s residence.

Hundreds of people gathered Friday evening in protests against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as part of ongoing demonstrations over his indictment on corruption charges and handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Demonstrators said they would not let Thursday’s news of the historic normalization agreement reached between Israel and the United Arab Emirates distract from Netanyahu’s failures. “This agreement does not make our government any more functional, this agreement does not make the prime minister any less corrupt, this agreement, above all, will not make us go away,” protester Eli Brook told the crowd. About 1,000 people attended the weekly Friday protests, which are called “Kabbalat Shabbat,” and tend to attract more young families than the larger Saturday night protests, which have frequently seen clashes between protesters and police. About 100 others protested outside Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea.

They have been joined in recent weeks by people protesting the government’s economic policies during the coronavirus pandemic, with crowds in the thousands and rising. Netanyahu is on trial for a series of cases in which he allegedly received lavish gifts from billionaire friends and traded regulatory favors with media moguls for more favorable coverage of himself and his family. The prime minister has denied any wrongdoing, accusing the media and law enforcement of a witch hunt to oust him from office. Last Saturday tens of thousands took part in protests across the country.

News article:
Israeli police arrested 11 people early on Sunday, as they forbade protesters outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Jerusalem residence from marching beyond a designated area, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Demonstrations against Netanyahu after sunset on Saturday have become a weekly occurrence. Economic protesters hit hard by restrictions to curb a second wave of coronavirus in Israel have joined political protesters, who demand the long-time prime minister step down until he proves his innocence in a corruption trial that started against him in May. Netanyahu denies the allegations against him. An estimated 10,000 Israelis turned out in Jerusalem late on Saturday, while many more protested outside Netanyahu's private villa north of Tel Aviv and on bridges over highways across the country. "Whoever is here, is taking part in an illegal gathering. No procession will be allowed. Anyone who disturbs the order will be arrested," an officer in a police car, using his megaphone, told the protesters in Jerusalem. The demonstrators waved Israeli flags, and chanted: "We won't give up until Bibi resigns." Bibi is Netanyahu's nickname. The overnight protests have continued despite the Israel-United Arab Emirates (UAE) peace treaty, widely seen in Israel as a major foreign policy achievement for Netanyahu.
