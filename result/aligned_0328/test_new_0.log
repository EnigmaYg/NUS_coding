News article:
Reuters reported on Tuesday about the significant role Iran has in arming, training, and commanding Shiite militias in Iraq. A secret branch of the Iraqi government known as the Popular Mobilization Committee (“Hashid Shaabi” in Arabic) serves as an umbrella group for Shiite paramilitary organizations. The group is run by Abu Mahdi al-Mohandis, who U.S. officials have accused of bombing the American and French embassies in Kuwait in 1983. Al-Mohandis is identified as a deputy of Qassem Suleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) Quds Force, in Iraq. Suleimani is a United States State Department-designated terrorist and the Quds Force is a designated terrorist organization. Mohandis was designated as an individual posing a threat to the stability of Iraq by the United States Treasury Department for targeting American and coalition forces in Iraq. A commander of the Badr Corps, a Shiite militia accused of severe human rights violations, was quoted saying that Suleimani “participates in the operation command center from the start of the battle to the end and the last thing (he) does is visit the battle’s wounded in the hospital.” Iran has supplied everything from tactical support to drones, electronic surveillance and radio communications to the Iraqi militias. There are billboards in Baghdad depicting IRGC Gen. Hamid Taghavi, who was killed in northern Iraq last December. In an essay in The Daily Beast appearing in early February, Michael Weiss and Michael Pregent wrote about Iran’s increasing influence in Iraq, which “has resulted in a wave of sectarian bloodletting and dispossession…usually at the hands of Iranian-backed Shia militia groups…” The Iraqi Minister of the Interior is a member of the aforementioned Badr Corps. Shiite militias were responsible for hundreds of American casualties during the Iraq War. Eli Lake asserted in Bloomberg View that “On the front lines of Iraq’s war against Islamic State, it’s increasingly difficult to tell where the Iraqi army ends and the Iranian-supported Shiite militias begin.” The long term problem of the tacit cooperation between the United States and the Iran-backed Shiite militias was summed up in a recent essay in Foreign Policy by Ali Khedery, the former adviser to five American ambassadors in Iraq, which highlighted the human rights abuses committed by the militias and Iraq’s military. Khedery expresses concern that the infiltration of the Iranian-backed militias is “eclipsing Iraqi institutions, and sowing the seeds of conflict for decades to come.” [Photo: الدعوة إلى الله / YouTube]

News article:
A new video released by the Islamic State (IS) extremist group appears to show militants turning Iraq's cultural heritage into dust as they destroy scores of priceless artifacts at a museum in the city of Mosul. The five-minute video, shared on social media on February 26, depicts militants smashing statues and other ancient treasures with sledgehammers. The video shows a militant who highlights that the artifacts on display in the museum depict or refer to gods other than Allah and are against Islam. A group of militants are then filmed removing plastic covers from statues and sculptures and turning them into rubble. One of the statues destroyed by the militants depicted a 900 B.C. Assyrian protective god in the form of a winged bull. An Iraqi Twitter user, who tweets under the name Ihsan, tweeted that the Islamic State group had "destroyed Iraq's last bit of cultural memory." "5,000 years of human heritage are gone forever," Ihsan tweeted, adding that, "All that's left of our country's heritage are pictures of what once was. We'll show our children photos of the glory we couldn't protect." The Islamic State group overran Mosul in June. According to The Daily Beast, the leader of Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, visited the Mosul Museum shortly after the group took control of the city. The release of the video appearing to show militants destroying priceless Iraqi artifacts came after the country's antiquities officials called on the Obama administration in July to help save Nineveh and other sites around Mosul. Iraqi National Museum Director Qias Hussein Rashid told The Daily Beast in July that the arrival of Islamic State was a "brutal shock" and that curators were "not able to take preventative measures." The militants told the museum staff that the ancient sculptures were "against Islam." The shocking images of Iraq's priceless cultural heritage being reduced to rubble in the February 26 video are not the first pictures of militants willfully destroying "non-Islamic" artifacts in Iraq and Syria. Images shared in November by Chechen Islamic State militants on the Russian social networking site VKontakte in late 2014 showed extremists smashing artifacts with hammers. The exact location where the pictures were taken in Syria was not specified. -- Joanna Paraszczuk

News article:
Iraq Advances on Booby-Trapped Road to Tikrit by VOA News March 03, 2015 An Iraqi coalition is battling its way toward Tikrit for a third day, facing Islamic State snipers and roadside bombs as it flanks the extremist group's strategic stronghold north of Baghdad. With an estimated 30,000 fighters pressing toward the rebel-held city, the offensive is Iraq's largest to date in an effort to regain control of territory lost to the militants last year. According to a French news agency (AFP) report, the Islamic State group on Tuesday claimed an American citizen with the nom de guerre Abu Dawud al-Amriki launched a suicide attack against encroaching Iraqi forces near the city of Samarra, the staging ground where anti-IS forces organized the march on Tikrit. The claim could not be independently verified. Shi'ite and Kurdish militia members have joined Iraqi troops in the province of Saladin in a highly publicized campaign to storm the provincial capital - and birthplace of executed leader Saddam Hussein - which was overrun by IS militants in June. Neighboring Iran is also said to have a hand in rolling out the operation, which includes air strikes and ground troops. Major General Qasem Soleimani, who heads the elite Iranian special forces division known as the Quds Force, joined Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi at the start of the offensive earlier this week. But beyond the tactical support, the extent of Iran's involvement in the battle for Tikrit remains unclear. A senior U.S. military official confirmed to VOA Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb that Tehran is contributing to the Tikrit offensive. A U.S.-led international coalition, which is responsible for daily air raids targeting the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, has been noticeably absent from the campaign; the military official said that as long as Iran is involved, the United States will stay out of the operation. A victory in Tikrit would be a geographic stepping stone for Iraqi forces to approach Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city that serves as an IS stronghold and nerve-center.

News article:
BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraqi troops fought on Tuesday with Islamic State extremists south of the jihadist-held city of Tikrit but their offensive to retake Saddam Hussein’s hometown was slowed by roadside bombs, local officials said. Backed by Iranian-backed Shiite militias and advisers along with Sunni tribal fighters, government forces made little headway on the second day of a large-scale military operation to recapture Tikrit, which fell to the Islamic State group last summer, two local officials said. Fierce clashes were underway mainly outside the town of al-Dour, south of Tikrit, while government troops were shelling terrorist bases inside the city, they said. The officials spoke anonymously as they were not authorized to brief media. On Monday, Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency reported Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the elite Revolutionary Guard’s Quds Force, was taking part in the offensive. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Soleimani has emerged as the chief tactician in Iraq’s fight against the Sunni militants. The military operation is seen as a litmus test for the capability of Iraqi troops to dislodge the jihadists from major cities they conquered in the country’s Sunni heartland in the north and west during an onslaught last summer. Previous attempts to capture Tikrit all failed because of tough resistance from the Islamic State. Tikrit, the provincial capital of Salahuddin province, is located 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Baghdad. It was taken by the Islamic State group along with the northern second-largest city Mosul during last year’s fighting. Advertisement US military officials have said a coordinated military mission to retake Mosul will likely begin in April or May and involve up to 25,000 Iraqi troops. But the Americans have cautioned that if the Iraqis aren’t ready, the offensive could be delayed. On Monday, Iraqi and U.S. officials said the US-led coalition was not involved in the Tikrit operation and had not been asked to carry out airstrikes. Also Gen. Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi, the military commander of the Salahuddin region told Iraqi state TV that troops would need some time to enter the city of Tikrit. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press

News article:
Iranian-supported militias make up the majority of ground forces now striking against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in the Iraqi city of Tikrit, in a growing shift of influence in the region even as the U.S. pours thousands of troops and millions of dollars in military equipment back into Iraq to bolster Baghdad's efforts against the terrorist group. "Iran's influence is growing in Iraq," commander of U.S. Central Command Gen. Lloyd Austin told the House Armed Services Committee Tuesday, in a day of congressional testimony from the Pentagon's top leaders that gradually painted a picture that was heavy in its revelations about Iran's role in Iraq, after years of little information on the issue. Iraq's operation over the weekend to attack Islamic State forces in Tikrit involved an Iraqi force that was made up of about one-third Iraqi Security Forces and two-thirds of Iranian-supported Shi'a militias, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey told senators, and was "the most overt" Iranian support in Iraq since Iranian-backed forces started infiltrating Iraq in 2004. Tikrit is a medium-sized Iraqi city about halfway between Baghdad and the northern city of Mosul and is the birthplace of Saddam Hussein. No U.S. support was requested by Iraq, which instead partnered with Shi'a militias to launch the operation against the Islamic State in Tikrit. On Tuesday, both generals sought to minimize the surprise of the Iranian's role, saying they are monitoring the interaction and support that Iranian forces in the east are providing Shi'a militias. Austin said the offensive did not catch the U.S. military off-guard. "We do not coordinate with the Iranians," Austin said. "Clearly, we have very good intelligence services. And we have good overhead Imagery… The activity in Tikrit was no surprise. I saw this coming many days leading up to this. It was a logical progression of what they've been doing in the east of the country." But lawmakers are growing concerned that Iran's influence will lead to future sectarian violence, as the U.S. was on the sidelines in Tikrit after spending more than $25 billion on Iraq's security forces and Iran was responsible for much of the technology behind sophisticated roadside bombs that claimed many U.S. soldiers' lives during U.S. combat operations in Iraq. "Are American taxpayer dollars going to the Shi'a militas that were once fighting against U.S. soldiers?" asked Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa. Three thousand U.S. troops are now in Iraq training new Iraqi security forces at four sites throughout the country, and the U.S. has budgeted about $3 billion to reconstitute the Iraqi Army after it collapsed against the Islamic State in the summer. That money is in addition to the $25 billion the U.S. spent on Iraq's security forces during its combat operations there. In addition, last week the Pentagon announced it was speeding another $17 million worth of arms to Iraq, including 10,000 M-16 rifles, 23,000 magazines of ammunition, 250 mine-resistant ambush protected vehicles, and a total of 1,750 Hellfire missiles to aid the fight. Both Dempsey and Austin said it would be difficult to keep the weapons out of the militia's hands. While Dempsey told the Senate Armed Services Committee "we've got confidence those are going into the right hands," he was quick to add that some of the previous weapons the U.S. sold Iraq through the Foreign Military Sales program are now in the "hands of Shi'a militia." "We are monitoring it as well as we can," Dempsey said. The U.S. is doing "everything in our power to prevent that from happening," Austin said. "The first line of defense is the Iraqi government." Dempsey said Iran's support and influence is "frankly only a problem" if it leads to further sectarian division in Iraq and the continued exclusion of Iraq's Sunni population from government and military leadership there. "We are going to have to count on the Iraqi government to do those things necessary to, number one, ensure that things don't trend toward greater sectarian violence," Austin said.

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, March 8 By Umid Niayesh - Trend: Iran will not have military presence in Iraq, Chief of Staff of Iran's Armed Forces, Major General Hassan Firouzabadi said. Firouzabadi made the remarks while responding a question about possibility of upgrading Iran's advisory presence in the neighboring country to military presence in the future. Major General Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force is in Iraq for military advice, Firouzabadi said, adding Soleimani is a powerful commander, who is familiar with the complicated wars. He also criticized the US military presence in Iraq saying establishment of peace and security is not an excuse for a country's military action in sovereign states, Iran's official IRNA news agency reported March 8. Iraqi army was disintegrated as a result of the US military interference so there was a need for Iran's advisory help, the commander said. On the other hand, commander of Iranian Army's Ground Force Brigadier General Ahmad Reza Pourdastan said that Iraq is the Islamic Republic's "strategic depth." Iran considers Iraq's security as its own, so will offer the neighboring country's army military training and advisory help if it is necessary. Earlier in September, Commander of the IRGC Aerospace Force Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh said that if there were no Iran's assistance, the Kurdistan Regional Government(KRG) would have been occupied by the IS(Islamic State) group. "Soleimani, himself with only 70 people prevented the IS from occupying the city of Arbil," Hajizadeh said. Iranian officials have repeatedly rejected reports about the presence of Iranian military forces in Iraq. Some KRG media have underscored the significant role of Iranian forces in fighting against the IS. The media reports said Iranian forces have a decisive presence on the battlefield. The Quds Force, the external-operations arm of the IRGC, has been involved for years in training Iraqi Shiite militias. It has also long worked with Hezbollah in Lebanon and has been reportedly helping Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the fight against the opposition in that country's civil war.

News article:
Iraqi forces, substantially bolstered by Iranian-backed Shiite militias, launched an offensive last week to capture the Iraqi city of Tikrit from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Tikrit is a predominantly Sunni city and the hometown of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. It is reported that 30,000 fighters are taking part in the offensive, of whom two-thirds are Shiite militiamen and approximately 700-1,000 are Sunni tribal fighters. The New York Times reports that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has advisers and troops on the ground and is providing artillery, rocket launchers, and surveillance drones. The Iraqi government did not ask for American air support for the offensive, according to the Associated Press, which has created fear of more Iranian influence and sectarian tensions. “This is the most overt conduct of Iranian support… Frankly, it will only be a problem if it results in sectarianism,” said Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday. However, Ali Khedery, a special assistant to five U.S. ambassadors to Iraq between 2003 and 2009, said that the “fundamental identity” of the Shiite militias is “built around a sectarian narrative rather than loyalty to the state.” Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said before a House Appropriations defense subcommittee on Wednesday that “sectarianism is one of the things that concerns me very much. And of course, it’s the root of the Iranian presence in Iraq.” Iran analyst Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace calls Iran “both the fire brigade and the arsonist.” The Iranians and Iran-backed Shiite militias are led by Qassem Suleimani, the commander of the IRGC’s external arm, the Quds Force. Suleimani is a U.S.-designated terrorist who has been said to be responsible for up to 20 percent of American casualties during the Iraq War. Suleimani has been seen in and around Tikrit. Christopher Harmer, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, referred to Suleimani as “a more stately version of Osama bin Laden” and expressed concern of U.S. de facto cooperation with him. It is feared that the Shiite militias will carry out revenge for ISIS’ massacre of over 1,000 predominantly Shiite fighters outside of Tikrit when they captured the city last June. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has said that “in this battle, there is no neutral party.” The Washington Post’s editorial board expressed alarm last week that the U.S. is “allowing Iran to take another step toward…[a] malevolent hegemony.” The Iranian involvement in the assault on ISIS in Tikrit is the latest engagement that prompted The New York Times last week to conclude that Iranian involvement in Iraq is United States government policy.

News article:
America’s strategy in fighting the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq (ISIS) has become “increasingly dependent on Iranian fighters,” according to an analysis published Friday in The New York Times. In the four days since Iranian troops joined 30,000 Iraqi forces to try to wrest Saddam Hussein’s hometown of Tikrit back from Islamic State control, American officials have said the United States is not coordinating with Iran, one of its fiercest global foes, in the fight against a common enemy. That may be technically true. But American war planners have been closely monitoring Iran’s parallel war against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, through a range of channels, including conversations on radio frequencies that each side knows the other is monitoring. And the two militaries frequently seek to avoid conflict in their activities by using Iraqi command centers as an intermediary. … “The only way in which the Obama administration can credibly stick with its strategy is by implicitly assuming that the Iranians will carry most of the weight and win the battles on the ground,” said Vali R. Nasr, a former special adviser to Mr. Obama who is now dean of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. “You can’t have your cake and eat it too — the U.S. strategy in Iraq has been successful so far largely because of Iran.” The Times article cites a number of battles where Iranian involvement was crucial, including breaking the siege of Amerli, freeing the city of Baiji from ISIS, pushing ISIS away from the Kurdish city of Erbil, and last week’s fight against ISIS in Saddam Hussein’s hometown of Tikrit, where “Iranian-backed Shiite militia leaders said that their fighters made up more than two-thirds of the pro-government force of 30,000.” The analysis in the Times highlighting Iran’s involvement in Iraq came a day after Secretary of State John Kerry said at a press conference in Saudi Arabia that despite the nuclear talks with Iran, the United States was keeping an eye on the Islamic Republic’s “destabilizing” behavior in the region. Now, I also want to make clear, as I did in every one of my meetings today: Even as we engage with these discussions with Iran around its nuclear program, we will not take our eye off of Iran’s other destabilizing actions in places like Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and the Arabian Peninsula – Yemen particularly. And whether or not we are able to reach a deal on the nuclear program, the United States will remain fully committed to addressing the full slate of issues that we have with Iran, including its support for terrorism. Last week, The Wall Street Journal published a video report (embedded below) of the increasing presence of Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps—Qods Force commander Qassem Suleimani on social media, portraying it as a sign that Iran wishes to take credit for its involvement in Iraq. In January, The New York Times reported that the administration was assuring Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, one of Iran’s chief clients, that he was not a target of American military efforts. While the interests of Iran and the United States may align for now, it may lead to disaster down the road, Jonathan Spyer and Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi warn in How Iraq Became a Proxy of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which was published in the December 2014 issue of The Tower Magazine: For the U.S. and its allies, this may represent a short-term advantage, but it is a long-term threat. The Iranian proxy militias, quite naturally, also embrace Iran’s ideology, which is intensely anti-American, anti-Western, and indeed, anti-Semitic. They parrot, for example, Iran’s official propaganda line, according to which the I.S. is supposedly a creation of “the Great Satan” (i.e., the United States) and/or the Jews. Nor does the eventual creation, or attempt to create, an Iranian sphere of influence across the Middle East bode well for American or Western interests. However effective they may be in fighting the I.S., Iran’s proxy militias in Iraq are part of this agenda and are helping Iran pursue it. Thanks to current Western policy, this time they are doing it with Western air support. [Photo: Wall Street Journal / YouTube ]

News article:
Tikrit, Iraq: Iraqi forces entered Tikrit Wednesday, dodging bombs and sniper fire in search of their biggest victory yet against embattled jihadists who tried to light new fires elsewhere in Iraq and Syria. The Islamic State group has suffered stinging defeats in the heart of its self-proclaimed “caliphate” recently, but its ultraviolent ideology has inspired attacks and recruits globally. With IS brutality and population displacement reaching new highs, Washington sought increased powers from the US Congress to take on a group threatening to reshape the Middle East. However, it was without direct support from the US-led coalition’s air campaign that Iraqi government and allied forces punched into parts of Tikrit, marking a new phase in a 10-day drive to wrest the city back from IS. A combination of army, police and volunteer forces moved into northern and southern Tikrit, the hometown of former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein and a main IS stronghold. A major general told AFP on condition of anonymity that government forces were battling “to cleanse the neighborhood of Qadisiyah” in Tikrit. “But we are engaging in a very delicate battle because we are not facing fighters on the ground, we are facing booby-trapped terrain and sniper fire. Our movement is slow,” he said. An army colonel said forces coming from another direction had also retaken the main hospital on the city’s southern edge. Early in the offensive, in which up to 30,000 men were initially involved while IS is believed to have just a few hundred men inside Tikrit, most outlying areas were reconquered. The town of Al-Alam, a flashpoint north of Tikrit along the Tigris river, was fully under the control of pro-government fighters and local anti-IS Sunni tribesmen Wednesday, an AFP reporter there said. On the back foot in eastern and northern Iraq, IS tried to seize the initiative elsewhere, including with a spectacular coordinated attack in Ramadi in the west. Twelve car bombs exploded almost simultaneously around the city after dawn, with at least seven suicide bombers targeting government security installations, police said. At least 17 people were killed and 38 wounded, according to a police lieutenant colonel and a doctor at Ramadi hospital. Clashes ensued but IS failed to gain any ground in one of the biggest attacks against a rare pocket of government control in Anbar. “Our brave security forces were ready and had excellent intelligence about the operation,” Anbar Governor Sohaib Al-Rawi said on social media. Also on the offensive in Syria, the jihadists launched a “huge assault” Wednesday to try to capture a strategic town on the border with Turkey, killing dozens. Their attack focused on Ras Al-Ain and IS seized a nearby village, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said the offensive was a preemptive strike against Kurdish militiamen planning to attack the IS-held town of Tal Abyad farther west. At least 12 fighters from the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, which control Ras Al-Ain and surrounding villages, were killed, he said. IS has also ramped up its propaganda war in what some analysts see as a possible sign of desperation by a movement on its last legs. After destroying several Iraqi heritage sites that are among the planet’s most precious, the jihadists again shocked the world on Tuesday by releasing a video in which an Arab Israeli accused of spying for Israel is “executed” by a boy who looks no older than 12. Addressing US lawmakers, Secretary of State John Kerry said it was a “pivotal hour” in the battle against the most violent group in the history of modern jihad. Appearing before the Senate foreign relations committee, he and top US defense officials appealed for a united vote in favor of a new authorization for the use of military force against IS. The United States leads a 60-nation coalition involved in the fight against the jihadists and has carried out hundreds of strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria. However, the US security establishment has expressed unease at the prominent role played by Iran in the military effort. “I am made uncomfortable by the fact that it looked like a Shia advance against a Sunni town,” former CIA chief Michael Hayden said Tuesday of the operation to retake Tikrit. Iran’s top commander for external military operations, Qassem Soleimani, has been ubiquitous on Iraq’s front lines. Comments by Iranian-backed militia commanders had stoked fears that the recapture of Tikrit could lead to widespread sectarian reprisal killings. But so far, reports of abuses by the mostly Shiite Iraqi forces battling IS in and around Tikrit have been relatively limited.

News article:
Thousands of Iraqi troops and militiamen laid siege to jihadist fighters holed up in Tikrit on Thursday, wary of rushing into streets littered with bombs and infested with snipers. After making major gains in and around the city on Wednesday, commanders were confident that Baghdad's biggest victory yet against the Islamic State (IS) group was only a matter of time. "Now we are moving to the second phase of our plan," Defense Minister Khaled al-Obeidi told reporters in Salaheddin province, of which Tikrit is the capital. "We are very keen for our losses to be as low as possible. Time is on our side, we have the initiative," he said on the 11th day of the offensive. None of the fighting forces involved has provided casualty figures since the start of the operation to wrest back Tikrit, the largest since IS captured the city nine months ago. Dozens of bodies are being driven south to Baghdad and the Shiite holy city of Najaf almost every day, however, and, while government forces have had the upper hand, IS has done damage with suicide car bombs, booby traps and snipers. "We don't want to be rushed because we want to avoid casualties," police Staff Major General Bahaa al-Azzawi told Agence France-Presse in Albu Ajil, a village from which Tikrit can be seen across the Tigris river. "Tikrit is sealed off from all sides," he said. All towns and villages on the eastern bank of the Tigris were under the control of anti-IS forces Thursday, including al-Alam, Albu Ajil and ad-Dawr. Black and white IS flags painted on walls had been graffitied over with slogans cursing the jihadist group or praising Shiite militia groups. Tikrit is on the west bank and, until military engineering units throw floating bridges across the river, the nearest bridge Iraqi forces can use is in Samarra, nearly 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the south. Troops and police as well as volunteers from the Popular Mobilization units moved deep into the northern half of Tikrit on Wednesday and finished securing outlying areas. - Sunni tribes fighting - Tikrit was the hometown of executed dictator Saddam Hussein, whose Baath party collaborated with the jihadists when they took over almost a third of the country last June. With crucial military backing from neighboring Iran and a 60-nation U.S.-led coalition, Baghdad has rolled back some of the losses. It started with operations to secure the Shiite holy cities of Karbala and Najaf and bolster Baghdad's defenses, then worked its way north, retaking Diyala province earlier this year. Commanders see the recapture of overwhelmingly Sunni Arab Tikrit as a stepping stone for the reconquest of Mosul further north, Iraq's second city, which once had a population of two million. Analysts say the battle for Tikrit is also a key test of how well the regular army can work with the myriad of militia groups and prevent reprisal attacks against Sunnis. The defense minister, who is himself Sunni, said he was impressed with the level of cooperation and played down concerns that victory in Tikrit could further alienate the minority community. "What caught my attention and was very positive, was that I met a number of fighters, maybe more than 250, who are all sons of Tikrit," he said. "It sends a very positive message to the Iraqi people and lifts the spirit of the security forces," Obeidi said. - Concern for civilians - Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi too hailed the advances made by government forces when he spoke to students at a technology institute. "With our unity we achieve victory and the greatest example of this is today in Salaheddin and Anbar," he said. IS launched a spectacular attack on the government-held heart of Anbar's capital Ramadi on Wednesday, using at least 12 simultaneous car bombs. Seventeen people were killed, mostly members of the security forces, in addition to a minimum of seven suicide bombers. An Australian teenager was reportedly one of the bombers, something which Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Thursday described as "absolutely horrific." With Iraqi forces choking jihadist fighters hunkered down in Tikrit's smoldering center, it was unclear how many civilians might still be trapped there. Shiite militia leaders had warned before the offensive began that it would be an opportunity to mete out revenge for the massacre by IS in June of hundreds of military cadets at a nearby base called Speicher. They have since publicly urged their men to refrain from any acts that could tarnish a victory, and relatively few reports of abuses have surfaced in nearly two weeks. However, Amnesty International cautioned it was still too early to tell if Tikrit had been a cleaner operation than usual. "For now access to combat areas is restricted and information about abuses may take time to filter out," the rights group's senior crisis response adviser Donatella Rovera told AFP.

News article:
Britain’s commander-in-chief in the Middle East has transmitted to London a request for authority for British troops to take over virtual military control of all Trans Jordan territory. Reinforcement on a considerable scale has already begun, presumably with the consent of Sir William Slim, chief of the Imperial General Staff who is now with the Middle East commander at Fayed, Egypt. Marine commando reinforcements and a tank regiment have already been landed at Aqaba, and the latest type fighter aircraft have been sent to Mafrak, chief R.A.F. base in Trans Jordan. But the crucial decision which the Cabinet in London must take is whether British aid is also to be extended to Iraqi forces in the Palestine triangle. The Trans Jordan view, as expressed by Brig. John Glubb Pasha, former Arab Legion commander, is that the Iraqis in Palestine are essentially flank cover for the Trans-Jordanians on the Jerusalem front. No British decision has been taken so far, but pressure from the Niddle East command, supported by Gen. Slim, is urgent; what is desired is full British responsibility for the entire Trans Jordan and Iraq front in Palestine. Sir Alec Kirkbride, British Ambassador to Trans Jordan, is now in London to discuss Anglo-Trans Jordan relations with the Foreign Office, an official spokesman revealed today. He added, however, that the visit was arranged before the recent events in Palestine occurred. A Foreign Office representative confirmed last night that the Israeli Government received a warning from Britain that if Jewish forces in the Aqaba area cross into Trans Jordan territory, British troops stationed at Aqaba would go into action against them.

News article:
The defeat of Saddam Hussein’s forces was as much a “watershed” in the Middle East as Egyptian president Anwar Sadat’s decision to seek peace with Israel, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff declared Tuesday. “We must all meet the challenge of peace with the same clarity and unity of purpose with which we met Saddam’s aggression,” Gen. Colin Powell told the closing luncheon of the 32nd annual policy conference of AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. He said Israel and the Arab states must seek a “common solution” that will result in “peace and security for all the nations and peoples of the Middle East.” Powell’s appearance was the emotional high of the three-day conference, attended by more than 2,000 people, including 800 college students, twice the number at last year’s conference. Conference participants greeted Powell with repeated ovations as they waved U.S. flags that had been provided at each seat. Many had tears in their eyes as they watched a 10-minute film, made by AIPAC’s office in Israel, showing the Iraqi missile attacks on Israel and the arrival of U.S. Patriot anti-missile batteries and their crews to safeguard Israel against the attacks. Powell praised Israel’s restraint in not responding to the 39 Scud missiles launched against it, even though “Israel had every right to respond to these terrorist attacks.” “Israel faced the same threat as the other members of the coalition,” and when it was attacked, “the United States stood by Israel,” he said. “Let there never be any question about our commitment to Israel,” the general added. He said that an Israel that is strong and secure is “an Israel that can participate in the peace process with confidence and security.” ARABS SHOULD MAKE FIRST MOVE But two U.S. senators, who addressed the conference’s annual banquet Monday night, said the Bush administration is going at peacemaking the wrong way and should be urging the Arab states, not Israel, to make the first move toward peace in the Middle East. “This is not the time to call on Israel to trade land for peace,” Sen. John Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) said to an ovation from the nearly 2,800 delegates and guests attending the AIPAC banquet. “This is the time when the Arabs should first demonstrate peaceful purposes and take concrete peacemaking steps,” he said. President Bush has called on Israel to consider giving up land for peace as part of a two-track diplomatic approach, in which the Arab countries move toward recognizing Israel while Israel seeks a dialogue with the Palestinians. Secretary of State James Baker said Sunday that both sides should move simultaneously, with neither having to go first. But Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) stressed to the AIPAC dinner audience that the Arab states, especially Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, must end their state of belligerency with Israel. Gramm also received an ovation when, observing that U.S. troops went to the Middle East to save those two countries, he said, “They owe us, and not the other way around.” “I do not believe it is asking too much to ask them to lay the cornerstone for lasting peace in the Middle East by recognizing the State of Israel,” he said. Rockefeller agreed, saying, “We did not send half a million American men and women to defend Saudi Arabia and to liberate Kuwait so those countries will continue to wage war against Israel.” But Rockefeller also stressed that Bush and Baker “must be more than a deal-maker” in trying to bring about Middle East peace. “They must be a friend” to Israel. Pointing out that the administration is “constantly reaching out” to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev despite his increasingly hard line, Rockefeller said, “Israel deserves no less than that.” Powell observed Tuesday that while the United States plans to strengthen its strategic alliance with Israel, it was allied democratically and morally with the Jewish state even before the strategic alliance existed. Before leaving the conference, Powell sought to clear up reports that he speaks Yiddish as a result of growing up in a Jewish neighborhood of the Bronx and even used that language to talk to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. “I do not speak Yiddish,” Powell said. He then paused and added, “Well, maybe a bissel.”

Qassem Soleimani, Iran's top officer responsible for foreign operations, provides assistance in Iraq "whenever we need him," Hadi al-Ameri, the commander of the Badr militia, said on Sunday. "He was giving very good advice. The battle ended now, and he returned to his operations headquarters," Ameri told journalists close to the Al-Alam area north of Baghdad. He was apparently referring to the battle to retake the nearby city of Tikrit from the Islamic State (IS) jihadist group, which began earlier this month and has since become a siege. "Qassem Soleimani is here whenever we need him," said Ameri, whose Badr militia is a powerful Iranian-backed force in the fight against IS. Ameri's remarks are a sign of the important role Soleimani plays in military operations against IS in Iraq and the influence Tehran wields here, both much to Washington's chagrin. Soleimani has advised Iraqi forces in multiple operations against IS, which led a major offensive last June that overran large areas north and west of Baghdad. In doing so, he and other Iranian advisers provide the kind of forward support during operations that U.S. President Barack Obama has yet to authorize American forces to undertake. Soleimani has played an increasingly public and open role in the fight against IS, a major change for a man who was once known as the elusive operative leading Iranian efforts against the U.S. in Iraq. Now, his face is widely known, pictures of him are shared on social media, and he has even been the topic of music videos.

News article:
Washington: Iranian fighter jets struck Daesh militants in eastern Iraq in recent days, the Pentagon said on Tuesday, signalling Tehran’s determination to confront the Islamist militants and Washington’s tacit partnership with arch-foe Iran. The air raids marked an escalation in Iran’s role in a conflict that has seen Tehran and the Washington set aside their customary hostility to battle a common enemy in Daesh, which both governments view as a dangerous threat. “We have indications that they did indeed fly air strikes with F-4 Phantoms in the past several days,” Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said. His comments came days after Al Jazeera ran footage of what appeared to be an F-4 fighter, similar to those used by the Iranian air force, attacking targets in the eastern province of Diyala. Iranian forces have been active on the ground in Iraq assisting Shiite militia and Baghdad government units, but this was the first time the United States had confirmed the Iranian air force was conducting strikes against Daesh. Kirby said the United States was not coordinating with Iranian forces and that it was up to the Iraqi government to oversee military flights by different countries. “We are flying missions over Iraq. We coordinate with the Iraqi government as we conduct those. It’s up to the Iraqi government to deconflict that air space,” Kirby told reporters. “Nothing has changed about our policy of not coordinating military activity with the Iranians.” Monitor Even if there is no direct communication between the two countries’ forces, the Americans likely would be aware and easily monitor flights over Iraq by Iran’s less sophisticated air fleet, which uses a fighter jet that dates back to the Vietnam War. A US air command centre in Qatar coordinates American fighters, bombers, drones and surveillance aircraft flying round-the-clock missions over Iraq along with other coalition warplanes from European governments as well as Australia and Canada. The onslaught of Daesh in Iraq has forged an unlikely alignment between Iran and the United States, which have been locked in a cold war for more than three decades. The fight against the Daesh has come amid a US diplomatic drive to agree a deal with Iran over its nuclear programme, and officials acknowledge the two sides have discussed the war in Iraq on the margins of the nuclear talks. But the two rivals remain deeply opposed over Syria, with Iran providing crucial military backing for President Bashar Al Assad while Washington has vowed to train a moderate rebel force to eventually confront the Damascus regime. Analysts and former US officials say neither country appears ready to pursue elaborate cooperation for military operations in Iraq, but there appears to be some level of tactical communication at least to avoid accidents. As the two governments expand their military activity in Iraq, there is a growing risk of potential crossed signals or conflict as Washington and Tehran remain bitter enemies. Shiite-ruled Iran has close ties to the Shiite-led government in Baghdad, and Tehran quickly came to the government’s aid after Islamist militants overran Iraqi army units in western and northern Iraq earlier this year. Iran also has provided Sukhoi Su-25 aircraft to Iraq amid widespread speculation that the planes are flown by Iranian pilots. Iranian weapons have made their way to Shiite fighters in Iraq, including 12.7mm rifles designed to penetrate armoured vehicles and multiple rocket launchers, according to a report by IHS Jane’s Defence. The commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force, Major General Qasim Sulaimani, led a counter-attack in Iraq over the summer that pushed back Daesh militants from a key route leading from Samarra to Baghdad, according to Lebanon’s Shiite movement Hezbollah. Sulaimani flew to Baghdad on June 10, hours after Daesh seized the Iraqi city of Mosul, and hammered out a strategy “to secure Baghdad and its surroundings,” according to the Shiite group’s Al Manar website. Sulaimani also reportedly has had a hand in operations against Daesh in Amerli in the north and in eastern Iraq near the Iranian border. Iranian television last month released a rare photo of Sulaimani in Iraq with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, promoting Tehran’s role in the fight against Daesh. Iran has declined to join the US-led coalition against Daesh and publicly dismissed the air war, but Tehran’s Iraqi allies have benefited from the strikes against the Islamist militants. Iran acquired its F-4 fighters from the United States before the 1979 revolution that toppled the country’s pro-US monarchy.

The air raids marked an escalation in Iran’s role in a conflict that has seen Tehran and the Washington set aside their customary hostility to battle a common enemy in Daesh, which both governments view as a dangerous threat. “We have indications that they did indeed fly air strikes with F-4 Phantoms in the past several days,” Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said. His comments came days after Al Jazeera ran footage of what appeared to be an F-4 fighter, similar to those used by the Iranian air force, attacking targets in the eastern province of Diyala. Iranian forces have been active on the ground in Iraq assisting Shiite militia and Baghdad government units, but this was the first time the United States had confirmed the Iranian air force was conducting strikes against Daesh. Kirby said the United States was not coordinating with Iranian forces and that it was up to the Iraqi government to oversee military flights by different countries. “We are flying missions over Iraq. We coordinate with the Iraqi government as we conduct those. It’s up to the Iraqi government to deconflict that air space,” Kirby told reporters. “Nothing has changed about our policy of not coordinating military activity with the Iranians.” Monitor Even if there is no direct communication between the two countries’ forces, the Americans likely would be aware and easily monitor flights over Iraq by Iran’s less sophisticated air fleet, which uses a fighter jet that dates back to the Vietnam War. A US air command centre in Qatar coordinates American fighters, bombers, drones and surveillance aircraft flying round-the-clock missions over Iraq along with other coalition warplanes from European governments as well as Australia and Canada. The onslaught of Daesh in Iraq has forged an unlikely alignment between Iran and the United States, which have been locked in a cold war for more than three decades. The fight against the Daesh has come amid a US diplomatic drive to agree a deal with Iran over its nuclear programme, and officials acknowledge the two sides have discussed the war in Iraq on the margins of the nuclear talks. But the two rivals remain deeply opposed over Syria, with Iran providing crucial military backing for President Bashar Al Assad while Washington has vowed to train a moderate rebel force to eventually confront the Damascus regime. Analysts and former US officials say neither country appears ready to pursue elaborate cooperation for military operations in Iraq, but there appears to be some level of tactical communication at least to avoid accidents. As the two governments expand their military activity in Iraq, there is a growing risk of potential crossed signals or conflict as Washington and Tehran remain bitter enemies. Shiite-ruled Iran has close ties to the Shiite-led government in Baghdad, and Tehran quickly came to the government’s aid after Islamist militants overran Iraqi army units in western and northern Iraq earlier this year. Iran also has provided Sukhoi Su-25 aircraft to Iraq amid widespread speculation that the planes are flown by Iranian pilots. Iranian weapons have made their way to Shiite fighters in Iraq, including 12.7mm rifles designed to penetrate armoured vehicles and multiple rocket launchers, according to a report by IHS Jane’s Defence. The commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force, Major General Qasim Sulaimani, led a counter-attack in Iraq over the summer that pushed back Daesh militants from a key route leading from Samarra to Baghdad, according to Lebanon’s Shiite movement Hezbollah. Sulaimani flew to Baghdad on June 10, hours after Daesh seized the Iraqi city of Mosul, and hammered out a strategy “to secure Baghdad and its surroundings,” according to the Shiite group’s Al Manar website. Sulaimani also reportedly has had a hand in operations against Daesh in Amerli in the north and in eastern Iraq near the Iranian border. Iranian television last month released a rare photo of Sulaimani in Iraq with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, promoting Tehran’s role in the fight against Daesh. Iran has declined to join the US-led coalition against Daesh and publicly dismissed the air war, but Tehran’s Iraqi allies have benefited from the strikes against the Islamist militants. Iran acquired its F-4 fighters from the United States before the 1979 revolution that toppled the country’s pro-US monarchy.

News article:
Iraqi president expects U.S.-led coalition air strikes on Tikrit soon By Richard Mably and Samia Nakhoul BAGHDAD, March 25 (Reuters) - Iraq's President Fouad Massoum said on Wednesday that the U.S.-led coalition will soon carry out air strikes against Islamic State in the Sunni city of Tikrit, after starting aerial reconnaissance flights this week. A three-week offensive by Iraqi government forces and Iranian-backed Shi'ite paramilitaries has failed to flush out Islamic State fighters from Tikrit, the birthplace of former dictator Saddam Hussein. "Since yesterday, aerial support and reconnaissance flights started in Tikrit. They first begin with reconnaissance missions; then they compile the aerial reports; and afterwards the aerial (strike) operations start," Massoum told Reuters in an exclusive interview at the presidential palace in Baghdad. Iraqi military commanders had asked for air strikes, while the Iranian-backed Shi'ite militias had publicly rejected the U.S. role in the campaign to retake the jihadist bastion. Faced with the deadlock, the Iraqi government had called a halt to most operations a week ago, citing concerns about civilian and military casualties. But Massoum made clear that the Iraqi government had decided to ask for the U.S.-led alliance's air support in the battle. "The Iraqi government along with residents of the area wanted an active contribution from the international coalition... The Iraqi government alone decides and no other force decides," Massoum, a veteran Kurdish politician who became Iraq's president last summer, said. He also alluded to the United States' previous hesitation to participate in battles alongside Iranian-supported Shi'ite armed factions and their Iranian advisers. "If there were any kind of hesitation in the position of the coalition to support the (Iraqi) army and volunteers in Tikrit," Massoum said. "It seems now that this sensitivity has ended. Of course, the participation of the coalition will have an impact." A senior Western diplomat told Reuters on Tuesday the Iraqi government was on the verge of requesting U.S.-led air strikes, and that the international community was ready to accept. The president said the timing of the air strikes will be determined by Iraqi and coalition military experts. "The experts decide whether this needs one week, less or more," Massoum told Reuters. He emphasised that the strikes would avoid the civilian populations despite Islamic State's attempts to use civilians as human shields and clearly target its fighting positions. Islamic State, a radical Islamist movement, which seizes to establish a medieval-style caliphate across the Middle East, seized large sections of northern and western Iraq and much of eastern Syria last year.

U.S. aircraft on Wednesday began providing air support for Iraqi forces fighting to retake Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from the Islamic State, putting them on the same side with Iranian-backed Shiite militias. In a statement, the coalition command said its forces were providing airstrikes, airborne intelligence-gathering and advising to Iraq's military at the request of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. "These strikes are intended to destroy [Islamic State] strongholds with precision, thereby saving innocent Iraqi lives while minimizing collateral damage to infrastructure," said U.S. Army Lt. Gen. James L. Terry, commander of coalition forces. "This will further enable Iraqi forces under Iraqi command to maneuver and defeat [the Islamic State] in the vicinity of Tikrit." Iraqi forces, assisted by Iranian-backed Shiite militias, have been fighting for control of Tikrit. Iranian advisers are also on the scene, including Gen. Qassem Soleimani, commander of Iran's Quds Force and a longtime U.S. nemesis. CIA Director John Brennan told Fox on Sunday that Soleimani's work in Iraq was creating instability and repeated the Obama administration's insistence that it would not cooperate with Iran in the fight against the Islamic State.

News article:
The war in Iraq may not be Israel’s war, as Prime Minister Ariel Sharon likes to say — but the stakes for Israel could hardly be higher. If the United States wins a convincing victory, it could assure Israel’s place in a more stable Middle East for years to come. If it does not, Israel could find itself the prime target of emboldened Middle Eastern radicals and face far greater threats to its existence than it does today. An overwhelming American victory and the establishment of a pro-western regime would remove a nonconventional — and possibly nuclear — threat to Israel from a capricious rogue regime. Moreover, a pro-Western regime in Baghdad would finally lay to rest one of Israel’s worst nightmares: a united “Eastern Front” consisting of Iraq, Syria and Jordan, with thousands of tanks ready to bear down on Israel from Jordanian territory. With Iraq, the most powerful of the three countries, out of the equation, the balance of power would change dramatically. That in turn would make it most unlikely that Jordan could be persuaded to forego its peace treaty with Israel, leaving Syria on its own and the “Eastern Front” notion devoid of operational meaning. A second major strategic benefit for Israel would be an American presence opposite Iran, perhaps Israel’s most implacable foe. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said recently that the United States had “suddenly” discovered that “Iran is much further along, with a far more robust nuclear weapons development program, than anyone said it had.” Powell was commenting on the fact that Iran managed to set up a centrifuge plant near the town of Natanz, 200 miles south of Tehran, undetected by Western intelligence agencies. The Iranians deny that they intend to develop nuclear weapons, but the centrifuges could be used to manufacture weapons-grade uranium, enabling Iran to produce several nuclear bombs a year beginning in 2005. A weakened Iraq, an American presence in the Persian Gulf and a credible American threat to disarm Iran might slow down the Iranian nuclear program. American success in Iraq also might weaken the Iran-Syria-Hezbollah axis, which threatens Israel from the north. Last year the Iranians delivered over 700 rockets to the fundamentalist Shi’ite militia through Syria. Hezbollah now has 1,000 rockets in southern Lebanon, trained on Israeli targets. The perception of American power and America readiness to use it could lead to Iran to rethink its ties with Hezbollah. It might also persuade Syria, not wanting to be held accountable for Hezbollah attacks on Israel, to rein in the organization. Some Israeli analysts, including Sharon’s national security adviser, Ephraim Halevy, say the ripple effect of American success even could lead to an Israel-Lebanon peace treaty, and possibly later to an accommodation with Syria. In this optimistic scenario, the Syrians pull out of Lebanon, disarm Hezbollah and seek a peace treaty with Israel as part of a vigorous new effort to curry favor with a victorious Washington. But even if things don’t go that far, the threat on Israel’s northern border is likely to diminish. Last but not least, American victory in Iraq could impact favorably on the Palestinian front. If Saddam is toppled and replaced by a less belligerent and more pragmatic regime — even one that isn’t exactly friendly toward Israel — that could serve as a model for change among the Palestinians. Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat could be further distanced from power and a new, reformed Palestinian leadership could help promote a peaceful modus vivendi with Israel. There are two possible negative outcomes. One is that the American campaign in Iraq proves ineffectual and Saddam survives with his regime intact. The second, less drastic possibility is if fierce fighting leaves many American casualties, emboldening Arab radicals to think that it is possible to stand up to Western might — and making the United States far more wary of future engagements in the Middle East. In either case, the prognosis for Israel would be dire. If Saddam survives, he could go nuclear a few years down the road, and might target Israel in revenge for what he calls the “American-Zionist conspiracy” against him. Even if he doesn’t go nuclear, he could still seek to threaten Israel by other means. Secondly, resurrection of the “Eastern Front” would become a theoretical option, with a strong Iraq exerting pressure on Jordan to break its ties with Israel and rejoin the rejectionist front. U.S. failure in Iraq also would encourage Iran to ignore American pressure about its nuclear program and to produce nuclear weapons as soon as possible. Iran already has developed and tested a prototype missile, the Shihab 3, which can reach Israel with either conventional or non-conventional payloads. According to SIDE’S 11-volume investigation, Iran’s spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khameini, was personally involved in planning and approving the attack. Indeed, an American setback in Iraq would encourage radical terrorists throughout the world, and especially in the Middle East, to step up their campaigns — and Israel would be a prime target. As one pundit put it in the Israeli media: “From an Israeli point of view, the success of the war is imperative. If pictures” of American POWs “like those we saw on Sunday continue to stream out of Iraq, it won’t be long before extremists in the Arab world start scenting blood and ‘join the party.’ If that happens, the northern border could heat up, motivation to carry out terror in Israel will grow and moderate Arab regimes, whose stability is vital for Israel, will be at risk.” Indeed, the radical threat could take its toll on moderate Arab regimes too, leaving Israel in a region more volatile than ever, exposed to terrorist and possibly even nonconventional weapons attack from all quarters. Israelis are keeping their fingers crossed for America. But they could just as easily be keeping their fingers crossed for themselves.

News article:
By Saif Hameed BAGHDAD, March 26 (Reuters) - Iraqi special forces advanced on central Tikrit on Thursday, backed by U.S.-led coalition planes in the largest offensive yet against Islamic State militants holding out in Saddam Hussein's home city. Coalition jets launched their first air strikes against Islamic State targets in Tikrit on Wednesday, coming off the sidelines to aid Iraqi forces against the Sunni Islamist militants. Underlying the complex web of loyalties behind the conflict, a senior U.S. general said Washington had demanded the withdrawal of Iran-backed Shi'ite militias fighting alongside Iraq's government before agreeing to take part. Two Shi'ite Muslim groups in turn said they were suspending participation in the fight in protest against the U.S. involvement. Some of the militias have targeted Americans in past Iraqi conflicts, but the fight against Islamic State has put them on the same side. A spokesman for Iraq's Defence Ministry said the coalition had carried out 17 strikes in Tikrit so far, in addition to 24 by Iraq's own airforce. "The Iraqi and coalition air forces conduct strikes in order to remove the enemy and then our forces advance," said General Tahsin Ibrahim Sadiq. "When the attacking forces advance, they clear any pockets of resistance and allow for the rest of our forces to move in and barricade further ahead." More than 20,000 Iraqi troops and allied Shi'ite paramilitary groups known as Hashid Shaabi have been taking part in the offensive, which began in early March but was brought to a halt around two weeks ago by homemade bombs and booby-traps. Iraqi forces retook the area surrounding Tikrit in the first week of the campaign, and entered some districts of the city itself, which had been overrun in June by Islamic State. But the militants have held out for more than three weeks in several areas including a sprawling complex of palaces that was built during Saddam's rule and covers an area of around 6 km overlooking the Tigris river, according to provincial officials. The mayor of Tikrit said coalition and Iraqi planes were striking the palace complex as well as the northern Qadisiya district, part of which is still held by insurgents, and the Shisheen neighbourhood in the south. "The focus is on the IS leadership command locations," said Omar al-Tikriti. Targets had to be carefully identified because IS fighters were believed to be holding prisoners in some of the 65 palaces. Two officers in the Tikrit operations centre said coalition and Iraqi strikes had targeted parts of the complex used by the militants to store weapons and ammunition. TWO MILITIAS SUSPEND ROLE The coalition joined the fray in Tikrit at the request of Iraqi military commanders, but Shi'ite militia commanders publicly rejected any U.S. role in the campaign to retake the jihadist bastion. The Kataib Hizbollah and Asaib Ahl al-Haq militias both suspended their participation in Tikrit on Thursday in protest, although the Badr Organisation, which is the largest and most powerful group within the Hashid Shaabi said it would continue to fight. "We were able to conclude the battle ourselves, but the U.S. came in order to usurp this major victory," Asaib Ahl al-Haq spokesman Naim al-Uboudi said. Jaafar al-Husseini, a military spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah, criticised Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi for inviting the coalition to take part and threatened to withdraw from the battlefield. "It is not possible for Kataib Hezbollah or any of the resistance factions to be in the same trench as the Americans." Speaking at an air base where Iraqi planes were taking off to fly sorties over Tikrit, Iraq's Defence Minister Khaled al-Obeidi played down the role of Iranian advisers in the battle.

News article:
Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) traveled to Baghdad on Monday, where he met Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to discuss the political and security situation there, according to the prime minister’s office. In another meeting with Speaker Salim al-Jabouri, Boehner affirmed support for Iraq’s democratic system and discussed the shared U.S. determination to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), according to a parliamentary statement provided to The Hill by a local journalist. {mosads}The Speaker’s visit with a congressional delegation comes as local forces, including Iranian-backed Shiite militias, work to retake the city of Tikrit, about 100 miles northwest of Baghdad, days after the U.S.-led, anti-ISIS coalition launched more than a dozen airstrikes there. United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon was also in Baghdad on Monday to meet with al-Abadi. The Iraqi prime minister will visit the U.S. and meet with President Obama on April 14, White House press secretary Josh Earnest announced last week. It will be al-Abadi’s first visit to Washington since becoming prime minister. With Congress on recess, Boehner traveled with Republican congressional delegations to England on Friday to discuss U.S.-British ties, and met with Jordan’s King Abdullah II on Sunday, where talks focused on Iranian-backed violence in the region, according to Boehner’s office. “America’s ability to lead in the world depends on Jordan’s ability to remain a stabilizing force in the Middle East, and we could not ask for a more solid partner,” Boehner said in a statement Monday. “We share the belief that defeating ISIL and stopping the spread of the terrorist threat will require a comprehensive approach. That means, in addition to security responses to the instability and violence, we have to improve our strategies to counter the economic and social drivers of radicalization,” Boehner added, using an alternate acronym for ISIS. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was meeting with Abdullah on Monday, according to the Jordanian leader’s official Twitter account. During a trip to Jerusalem over the weekend, McConnell warned that international negotiators are on the cusp of a bad deal on Iran’s nuclear program, with a preliminary deadline looming Tuesday for a framework agreement. Boehner is expected to visit Israel later this week, though he has no plans to speak to speak to its Knesset parliament. At the Speaker’s invitation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Congress earlier this month.

Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) traveled to Baghdad on Monday, where he met Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to discuss the political and security situation there, according to the prime minister’s office. In another meeting with Speaker Salim al-Jabouri, Boehner affirmed support for Iraq’s democratic system and discussed the shared U.S. determination to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), according to a parliamentary statement provided to The Hill by a local journalist. {mosads}The Speaker’s visit with a congressional delegation comes as local forces, including Iranian-backed Shiite militias, work to retake the city of Tikrit, about 100 miles northwest of Baghdad, days after the U.S.-led, anti-ISIS coalition launched more than a dozen airstrikes there. United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon was also in Baghdad on Monday to meet with al-Abadi. The Iraqi prime minister will visit the U.S. and meet with President Obama on April 14, White House press secretary Josh Earnest announced last week. It will be al-Abadi’s first visit to Washington since becoming prime minister. With Congress on recess, Boehner traveled with Republican congressional delegations to England on Friday to discuss U.S.-British ties, and met with Jordan’s King Abdullah II on Sunday, where talks focused on Iranian-backed violence in the region, according to Boehner’s office. “America’s ability to lead in the world depends on Jordan’s ability to remain a stabilizing force in the Middle East, and we could not ask for a more solid partner,” Boehner said in a statement Monday. “We share the belief that defeating ISIL and stopping the spread of the terrorist threat will require a comprehensive approach. That means, in addition to security responses to the instability and violence, we have to improve our strategies to counter the economic and social drivers of radicalization,” Boehner added, using an alternate acronym for ISIS. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was meeting with Abdullah on Monday, according to the Jordanian leader’s official Twitter account. During a trip to Jerusalem over the weekend, McConnell warned that international negotiators are on the cusp of a bad deal on Iran’s nuclear program, with a preliminary deadline looming Tuesday for a framework agreement. Boehner is expected to visit Israel later this week, though he has no plans to speak to speak to its Knesset parliament. At the Speaker’s invitation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Congress earlier this month.

News article:
Iraqi Security Forces have liberated the city of Tikrit from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced Tuesday. Al-Abadi made the announcement to Iraqi media, but also on Twitter. PM Al-Abadi announces the liberation of Tikrit and congratulates Iraqi security forces and popular volunteers on the historic milestone — Haider Al-Abadi (@HaiderAlAbadi) March 31, 2015 The “popular volunteers” is a reference to Shia militia controlled by the Iraqi Ministry of Defense. However, it is not clear whether the battle for Tikrit is actually over. Al-Abadi’s spokesman Rafid Jaboori told Agence France Presse that “Iraqi forces reached the centre of Tikrit, raised the Iraqi flag and are now clearing the city.” The Pentagon issued a statement several hours later to confirm Abadi’s announcement. “We can confirm ISF’s advancement into Tikrit to liberate the city center as well as other parts of the city from ISIL,” it said in a statement, using an alternate name for ISIS. “The coalition will continue to provide support to the ISF as they continue to operate in the area.” Iraqi Security Forces began an offensive to retake the city from ISIS on March 2, and victory would be a huge blow to ISIS, which captured the city last summer. Initially, the U.S. refrained from taking part in the operation, due to the participation of an Iran-backed Shia militia. However, the operation had stalled in recent days, prompting Iraq last week to formally request the U.S. conduct airstrikes in Tikrit. The U.S. began striking targets last week, after the Iraqi government agreed that the Iran-backed Shia militia they would not take part in the offensive, according to U.S. officials. Some reports say that the militia had objected to U.S. airstrikes, and they left after the U.S.-led coalition began to conduct them in Tikrit. Iran has sent commanders and troops into Iraq to assist forces in the fight against ISIS, which has raised questions over whether the U.S. was cooperating with Iran in Iraq. U.S. officials deny any cooperation with Iran, and say Iraqi officials are responsible for coordinating U.S. and Iranian efforts in Iran. — Updated 6:30 p.m.

News article:
While much of the world’s attention is focused on the war in Yemen against Iranian-backed rebels, as well as the aftermath of the nuclear negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 states, Iraq (backed by Iran) has achieved a significant achievement in the long battle against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). In recent weeks, the Iraqi army was able, with the help of Iranian-backed Shiite militias and United States-led air raids, to retake the city of Tikrit (Arabic link), the hometown of Saddam Hussein, from the forces of the Islamic State. Conquest of the city is but one step in the long journey to retake the territory that had previously been controlled by the extremist terror group. The path to stability is still long, because the chaos in Iraq is not only a result of massive ISIS raids but also of corrupt sectarian governments that ruled the country in the decade preceding the conquest carried out by ISIS in northern and western Iraq. ISIS, which ruled Tikrit for a few months, committed massacres and abuses against local population. Many residents were forced to leave their homes. The Iraqi army was able to retake the city after a month of battles. Tikrit, it should be noted, is a predominantly Sunni city and is considered a stronghold of the Sunni resistance to the pro-Iranian Shiite government in Iraq. Therefore, the victory in the city is symbolically important for Baghdad. The Iraqi government used Shi’ite militias supported by Iran to take Tikrit. Analysts believe that the government had no choice but to do so because of the weakness of the army. After a while, the international coalition forces also began to intervene from the air, bombing areas in Tikrit. Shiite forces on the ground did not like the Western involvement and withdrew from the battle. After a few days, they returned to the fighting and helped complete the takeover of the city. The Shiite militias were accused of looting and vandalizing the Sunni population of Tikrit. As a result, the Iraqi government decided to ban the Shiite militias from taking part in future attempts to re-capture Mosul, the main stronghold of ISIS. The news site al-Arabi al-Jadid reported (Arabic link) that this is an implied admission of mistakes made during the conquest of Tikrit. Iraq is expected to rely instead on air strikes of coalition forces led by the United States. Tikrit, it should be noted, is a strategic city, since it leads to Mosul (Arabic link), Iraq’s second largest city and the most prominent city held by ISIS in Iraq. The conquest of Tikrit is therefore an important step towards the retaking Mosul from the terror group. But Mosul is a much bigger city than Tikrit and its liberation will be much more difficult. ISIS has held the city for ten months has had more than adequate time to prepare for potential invasions. The city also is further away from Baghdad than Tikrit is, and the logisticis of transferring aid and military equipment to this area on a continuous basis are much more difficult. In addition, while most of the residents of Mosul abhor ISIS’s terrorism and control of the city, they are not fond of the government and the Iraqi army, which take orders from Iran and its proxy Shiite militias. Iraq won the battle for Tikrit, but now it will have to gain the support of the Sunnis. Disgust felt by the Sunni tribes in Iraq to the country’s Shiite government facilitated the takeover of Iraqi lands by ISIS last year. According to some observers, members of the former regime of Saddam Hussein helped the terrorist group. The Iraqi government needs the support of the Sunnis to keep the re-occupied territories’ stable. To do this, the government has been trying to integrate Sunni forces into the army divisions in Tikrit. Now, Sunni tribes are seeking funding and arms from the central Iraqi government, similar to the aid granted to Shiite militias. Sunnis under ISIS control find themselves in a bind. On the one hand, they suffer from ISIS’s terrorist regime, which is full of religious restrictions and persecution. But they are also uncertain of their future under an Iraqi regime that is backed by Iran and allied Shiite militias. The cooperation of these three groups – Sunnis, Shiites, and the Iraqi army – ultimately will determine whether the liberation of Mosul from ISIS will be successful.

News article:
Iran increases gas production; no need for Turkmenistan gas January 7, The Iran Project – Following the row between Iran and Turkmenistan over outstanding debts for previous natural gas sales, Ithe slamic Republic, to compensate for the halt in supplies from its northern neighbor, increased gas production and cooperated with other countries. Although Turkmenistan’s move to cut exports of natural gas to Iran led to a halt in the activities of several power plants in northern Iran that run on gas, we could successfully provide enough gas for residential and industrial areas of Mazandaran province, said Mohammad Esmaeil Ebrahimzadeh, CEO of an NIGC offshoot in the northern province of Mazandaran. Saying Iran’s gas production has been increased more than 50 percent over the past three years, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh also noted that there is no problem for gas production. Zanganeh repeatedly explained over the past three years, due to the opening of South Pars phases, we could increase gas production by 50 percent. Meanwhile, Deputy Director of National Iranian Oil Company announced that to compensate Turkmenistan gas halt, Iran’s central regions increased gas production to 300 million cubic meters of gas per day. This past Sunday, Turkmenistan cut exports of natural gas to Iran on grounds that the country should make a rapid payment of the debts that remained from past sales. Iran’s Ministry of Petroleum in a statement on Monday strongly criticized Turkmenistan’s move, describing it as “illogical”. It added that Turkmenistan – which it said had also turned the taps on Iran over price disputes during several past winters – had acted against an agreement that had been reached between Tehran and Ashgabat.

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, Jan. 10 By Dalga Khatinoglu – Trend: Iran has prioritized development of Tous gas field, the second upstream gas project after Khangiran in the country’s north-eastern part. The decision comes 10 days after Turkmenistan cut gas flow to Iran. Astan Quds Razavi Holding would develop Tous field, Mohammad Mam Beigi, the managing director of East Oil & Gas Production Co., told IRNA Jan. 10. Tous’ reserve contains 60 billion cubic meters (bcm) of sour gas and Iran projects to produce 4 million cubic meters per day (mcm/d) of gas from the field, he said. Mam Beigi didn’t mention when Astan Quds Razavi Holding would start developing the field, but he said the company has finished the study of reserve according to a memorandum of understanding. Currently, only Khangiran field in northeast of Iran is operating with nearly 48 mcm/d of gas production. Turkmenistan cut gas flow to Iran on January 1 due to a dispute over gas price and violation of take-or-pay term of the sides’ agreement. Iran doubled gas import from Turkmenistan in 2015 to 9 bcm, but according to the agreement, it should have imported 14 bcm. During a period from 2006 to 2016, Iran imported about 74.35 bcm of Turkmen gas, the official statistics of Iran’s Oil Ministry indicates. But based on the agreement, which was amended in 2007 and came into force in 2010, Iran should have imported 130 bcm of Turkmen gas.

News article:
It appears Turkmenistan is about to lose its second-best customer for natural gas, Iran. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said on August 11 that his country no longer needed gas from Turkmenistan. Zanganeh went so far as to say, "Iran is importing Turkmen gas just because it is important to promote political and economic relations with Turkmenistan." The oil minister's comments could be bargaining tactics, as Iran has frequently sought to convince Turkmenistan to lower the price for its gas, or it could reflect a potential shift in Iran's role in the international gas market. Zanganeh said that with Iran about to boost domestic gas production by some 200 million additional cubic meters starting in March next year, the country could "abandon completely gas imports from Turkmenistan." This contrasts with his statements in May that Iran would continue to import Turkmen gas at existing levels. It is quite a turn of events for Turkmenistan. In early 2010 a new, second pipeline bringing Turkmen gas to Iran was launched. At that time leaders in the two countries spoke about gas imports to Iran reaching up to 20 billion cubic meters (bcm) annually. A new gas-compressor station started operation in western Turkmenistan in December 2013, built specifically to export more gas to Iran. The first gas pipeline connecting the two countries -- the 200-kilometer Korpedzhe-Kurdkui pipeline -- was launched at the end of 1997. It was also the first pipeline that gave Turkmenistan an export route to somewhere outside the former Soviet Union. Iran funded construction of the pipeline to import some 8 bcm of gas a year, mainly to areas of northern Iran that were not well connected to the gas fields of the south. Russia remained the biggest purchaser of Turkmen gas until a suspicious explosion along the pipeline connecting the two countries occurred in April 2009, amid tense negotiations between the two over the price for Turkmen gas. The ruptured pipeline cut off gas flows entirely for months. Iran then became for a brief time the main buyer of Turkmen gas, until the new pipeline from Turkmenistan to China started operation at the end of 2009. Supplies of Turkmen gas to Russia were eventually renewed, but in greatly diminished volumes, leaving Iran the No. 2 customer for Turkmen gas, after China. International sanctions on Iran have hindered the country from developing its gas sector and from constructing an infrastructure to distribute gas for domestic use. Iran has the second-largest proven gas reserves in the world (Russia has the most) but again, due to sanctions there has been little opportunity to take advantage of that resource. As talks progress between Tehran and major world powers about Iran's nuclear program, and sanctions are slowly eased, there are new prospects on the horizon for Iran and gas exports are a big part of that. The same day Zanganeh spoke of the end of Turkmen gas imports, the deputy oil minister in charge of international affairs, Ali Majedi, told journalists Iran was ready to supply Europe with gas via the Nabucco pipeline project. Nabucco was recently shelved after more than a decade of shareholders trying to get potential gas suppliers to sign contracts for supplies, which gas suppliers were hesitant to do since it was unclear how soon, or even if, Nabucco would be built. Nabucco was originally envisioned to bring gas from Caspian Basin countries -- Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, possibly Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan -- and also possibly from Iraq to Europe by way of a 3,300-kilometer pipeline. Nabucco was all but scrapped after Azerbaijan opted last year to use the Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline to feed into the Trans-Adriatic pipeline across Southern Europe. Majedi claimed two European countries had already shown interest in reviving the Nabucco scheme and that "Iran with its major gas fields could supply gas to Europe via Nabucco." And Nabucco's map of its proposed route envisioned the possible inclusion of Iran, so the route is already set. In such a scenario Turkmenistan changes from Iran's gas supplier into Iran's competitor for a space in a pipeline across northern Iran into Turkey and on, eventually, to Austria. If Oil Minister Zanganeh was sincere in his remarks, this is very bad news for Turkmenistan. It leaves Turkmenistan with two customers for its gas – China and Russia. China is a guaranteed long-term and virtually insatiable customer. Russia has always mixed politics with business in gas dealings with Turkmenistan, an arrangement Ashgabat hoped it was breaking as the Central Asian state showed it was diversifying its export markets. -- Bruce Pannier, with contributions from Toymyrat Bugayev of RFE/RL's Turkmen Service

The Express Tribune A gas pipeline between Iran and Iraq will be unveiled on Tuesday, though exports to the latter will remain at a standstill, a spokesman for National Iranian Gas Company (NIGC) said.“Iran is ready to inject gas into the export pipeline; the Iraqi side is still unprepared to receive Iran’s natural gas,” remarked Majid Bujarzadeh, NIGC spokesman.Earlier, Iranian Deputy Oil Minister for International Affairs Amir Hossein Zamaninia said the pipeline for gas exports to Baghdad was replete with natural gas, but Letters of Credit (LCs) needed to be opened first for the process to begin.He noted that banking issues had to be fully resolved before Iranian gas could be supplied to Iraq, explaining that “a letter of credit is a letter from a bank guaranteeing that a buyer’s payment will be received by the seller on time and for the correct amount.”Being part of the sixth national pipeline, which will transmit gas to Iraq, it will be inaugurated, but exports will not begin. NIGC Managing Director Hamidreza Araghi will attend the unveiling ceremony on Tuesday.The second part of the sixth national pipeline with a length of 600 km is still under construction. The national gas pipeline network has the capacity to carry 110 million cubic metres per day and it will supply natural gas to Iraq and Syria.NIGC and the Iraqi Ministry of Electricity and Power signed a gas contract in 2013 and in 2016 the scope of the deal was extended in order to increase the export volume and duration. Accordingly, seven million cubic metres per day will be exported initially and the volume will touch the highest level in line with the contract after 21 months.As such, in hot seasons 35 and in cold ones 25 million cubic metres of natural gas will be supplied to the Baghdad region, yielding an aggregate of 10 billion cubic metres per year.A deal for gas exports to Basra was inked in 2015. According to the agreement, 35 and 25 million cubic metres of natural gas will be exported to the Iraqi region in hot and cold seasons, respectively.Though nearly three years have passed since the signing of the gas contract between Iran and Iraq, gas exports have remained at a standstill as delays have mainly been caused by activities of the Islamic State terrorist group as well as Iraq’s failure to fulfil the financial claims of contractors.Published in, January 24, 2017.Like Business on Facebook , follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, Jan. 24 By Farhad Daneshvar – Trend: Iran may file a complaint against Turkmenistan in the International Court of Arbitration over a recent gas dispute, a senior Iranian oil official said. Hamid-Reza Araqi, Iranian deputy oil minister, has said that his country will definitely file the complaint in the International Court of Arbitration if Turkmenistan refuses to hold talks with Iran to resolve the issue, Mehr news agency reported. He further pointed to the agreement on gas swap between Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan through Iran and added that about six million cubic meters of gas are swapped between the two post-Soviet nations on a daily basis. “Although Turkmenistan has stopped exporting gas to Iran, we have, so far, no plans on halting the neighboring country’s gas swap program,” he added. Araqi further called for launching talks aimed at resolving the issue. Turkmen Foreign Ministry said Jan. 3 that Turkmenistan limited the natural gas supply to Iran from Jan. 1 over the outstanding debts for previous natural gas sales.

Tehran, Iran, Jan. 28 By Mehdi Sepahvand – Trend: Iran is ready to sit for gas talks with Turkmenistan, but first the Turkmens would have to “make up for the damages they have done”, CEO of the National Iranian Gas Company Hamidreza Araqi told Tasnim news agency January 28. Turkmenistan halted gas flow to Iran on January 1, just one day after they had agreed that a previous deal for gas import from Turkmenistan would stay in force for five years. Turkmenistan claims Iran has to pay $1.8 billion due payment for gas it received in 2007-2008. Iran denies the claim. In that period Turkmenistan reportedly increased the gas price for Iran from $40 to $360 per 1,000 cubic meters, despite a 20-year deal. Turkmenistan had been supplying gas to Iran since December 1997. On Jan. 24, Araqi said Tehran may file a complaint against Turkmenistan in the International Court of Arbitration over the gas dispute. In his most recent interview, however, Araqi said Iran may for the time being consider not pursuing the legal case. He added Iran considers the previous agreement invalid and would only negotiate a new agreement.

Given expiry time of former agreement, advisor to the Petroleum Minister and in charge of following up claims of the Ministry Ali Asghar Hendi and Director General for discovery and oil, gas production of Oil Ministry of Oman Ceif Hamad al-Salmani signed the document.Meeting between Iranian and Omani delegation to renew the agreement and considering the latest situation to prepare preliminary works to build the pipeline held Tuesday morning in presence of Petroleum Minister Bijan Zangeneh and Omani Minister of Oil and Gas Mohammad bin Hamad al-Rumhi.During the meeting, representatives from companies like French Total, Shell (Dutch-British), South Korean Cogs, German Uniper and Japanese Mitsui were present and offered their proposals for possible participation in the project.Zangeneh said that we reach sum up on ways to implement the project until the end of February.Iran and Oman signed Memorandum of Understanding in year 2013 for exporting natural gas to Oman through a pipeline from under Persian Gulf seabed.It is due that a part of the gas to be consumed in Oman and the rest of it to turn to Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) and to be exported to the target markets.Considering opposition of the United Arab Emirates by passing the pipeline from its shallow waters, the pipeline should pass deep waters of the Oman Sea, so it will increase both cost and execution time.Iranian companies have construction and installation technology to build pipeline in shallow waters of the sea, but they do not have experiences to install pipeline under deep waters and more than one thousand meters, so they should use international companies’ experiences.1391**2050

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, Feb. 8 By Fatih Karimov – Trend: The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) signed a memorandum of understanding with Malaysia's Bukhary International Ventures(BIV), to study two gas fields in Iran. The deal was signed by Gholam Reza Manouchehri, deputy head of the NIOC and Shamsul Azhar bin Abbas, head of the BIV on Feb. 8 in Tehran, Shana news agency reported. Under the MoU, the Malaysian firm will undertake studies in Iran’s Ferdowsi and Golshan gas fields and will submit its feasibility studies to the NIOC within seven months. The reserve at the Golshan gas field, located at approximately 180 km south east of Bushehr, 65 km offshore the Persian Gulf, is estimated more than 50 trillion cubic feet of gas and it is expected to produce 2.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. The Ferdowsi gas reserve is estimated at around 10 trillion cubic feet and it would produce more than 880 million cubic feet of gas on a daily basis. Manouchehri said that the BIV will study gas extraction from the fields and its transfer to onshore to convert to LNG. He further said that the fields also posses very heavy crude oil, adding that Iran has never extracted this type of crude oil so far. Manouchehri said that the signed MoU follows a deal that was made in 2007 with Malaysia's Bukhary group in 2007. In December 2007, Malaysia’s SKS signed a preliminary agreement with NIOC to develop the Golshan and Ferdowsi gas fields and construct a plant to produce LNG from them.

News article:
Ankara: Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday Tehran would not accept “unreasonable demands” by world powers during negotiations over its disputed nuclear programme, and ruled out letting inspectors interview its atomic scientists. The comments, broadcast live on state TV, were the latest in a series of forthright statements on inspections in the countdown to a June 30 deadline to resolve a decade-old standoff over Iran’s nuclear work. “We will never yield to pressure ... We will not accept unreasonable demands ... Iran will not give access to its (nuclear) scientists,” Khamenei said. “We will not allow the privacy of our nuclear scientists or any other important issue to be violated.” Khamenei, who has the final say for Iran on any deal, last month ruled out any “extraordinary supervision measures” over nuclear activities and said military sites could not be inspected. The UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been trying to investigate Western allegations that Iran has worked on designing a nuclear warhead. Iran says its nuclear programme is peaceful and that it is working with the IAEA to clear up any suspicions. UN inspectors regularly monitor Iran’s declared nuclear facilities, but the IAEA has complained for years of a lack of access to sites, equipment, documents and people relevant to its probe. Western officials say Iran must step up cooperation with the IAEA if it wants to reach a broader diplomatic deal with world powers that would gradually end crippling financial and other sanctions on the oil producer. “They say we should let them interview our nuclear scientists. This means interrogation,” Khamenei said. “I will not let foreigners talk to our scientists and to interrogate our dear children ... who brought us this extensive (nuclear)knowledge.” Iran has yet to answer questions about two areas of the investigation into alleged research activities that could be applicable to any attempt to make nuclear bombs - explosives testing and neutron calculations. Iran reached a tentative deal with the powers on April 2 to allow UN inspectors to carry out more intrusive, short-notice inspections under an “Additional Protocol” to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. But there have been sharply differing interpretations from both sides on the details of that access. Negotiators from Iran and the powers will meet in Vienna on Wednesday to try to iron out remaining differences, including the timing of sanctions relief and the future of Iran’s atomic research and development programme. Talks between EU political director Helga Schmid and Iranian negotiators Abbas Araqchi and Majid Takht-Ravanchi will run until Friday, with experts meeting in parallel to discuss technical annexes, the EU said in a statement.

Supreme Leader: No inspection to military sites allowed IRNA - Islamic Republic News Agency Tehran, May 20, IRNA – Supreme Leader of Islamic Revolution said on Wednesday that Iran will not allow inspection to any military sites. Addressing the graduation ceremony of Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khameneie said that Iran will not allow interview with the nuclear scientists either. 'Permission for doing such things will absolutely not be available and the enemies should know that the Iranian nation and the government will at no case retreat in confrontation with their totalitarian and bullying demands,' the Supreme leader said. The Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces expressed deep concern about the attempt made by certain governments in the Persian Gulf region pushing forth proxy wars towards the Iranian borders. 'If any notorious act takes place, the Islamic Republic of Iran's reaction will be very severe,' the Supreme Leader said. Ayatollah Khamenei said that the Iranian nation's prestige was revived thanks to Islam and the revolutionary ideals of the Iranian nation and thank God, the Islamic Republic of Iran is powerful enough to thwart the challenges. 'We feel no fear of being faced with such challenges, since being challenged is a sign of being dynamic, alive, active and moving forward,' added Ayatollah Khamenei. 'The Iranian nation will pass through the challenges mightily, having trust in God, and with high self-confidence,' he said. Ayatollah Khameneie said that one of those challenges is the oppressive approach and totalitarianism of the western governments in the nuclear talks. 'The enemies have still not well understood the Iranian nation and government and that is the reason why they have aggressive demands, because the nation, and the government that is a part of this nation, will never yield to arbitrary demands,' the Supreme Leader said. 'The more we will retreat in confrontation with the totalitarian demands of the western governments, the more they will advance.' The Supreme Leader said that a strong wall comprised of trust in God and national might needs to be constructed against such totalitarian demands. 'I will not permit the aliens to come and talk with the scientists, the dear childern of this nation, for interrogation.' Ayatollah Khameneie said that the dear officials of our country who are bravely moving in this field should know the only way to confront the rude and shameless enemy is having a resolute will and refraining from passiveness. 'The officials and negotiating team must convey the message of the Iranian nation's grandeur in the nuclear talks.' 2329**1416 NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
Iran has provided some information about one of two open items in a U.N. nuclear watchdog investigation into whether it may have researched an atomic bomb, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported on Friday. The confidential IAEA report, obtained by Reuters, said Tehran had "shared some information in relation to one of these measures. The Agency and Iran agreed to continue the dialogue on these practical measures and to meet again in the near future", Reuters reported. The latest quarterly IAEA report on Iran was issued to the U.N. agency's member states with Iran seeking to nail down final terms of an accord with six world powers on curbing its disputed nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions. The seven countries have set themselves a deadline of June 30 but that is showing signs of slipping. The Vienna-based IAEA also said it remained vital that Iran provide answers to the agency's questions on and access to the Parchin military base, where Western officials suspect Tehran conducted explosives tests relevant to nuclear bombs. The Islamic Republic denies this and has long maintained that it is enriching uranium only for electricity and medical isotopes rather than to develop a nuclear bomb capability in secret as the West has suspected. "The (IAEA) remains ready to accelerate the resolution of all outstanding issues under the Framework for Cooperation. This can be realized by increased cooperation by Iran and by the timely provision of access to all relevant information, documentation, sites, material and personnel in Iran as requested by the agency," the report said. Western diplomats have viewed Iran's stonewalling of the IAEA inquiry as an indicator of the its unwillingness to cooperate fully until punitive sanctions are lifted in talks with the six powers that resumed in Vienna this week. The United States said it is not considering negotiating beyond the end-June deadline despite comments from France and Iran indicating there was some room to do so. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is to reconvene with Iranian counterpart Mohammed Javad Zarif in Geneva on Saturday. The lead U.S. negotiator, Wendy Sherman, flew to Vienna on Wednesday for talks among Iran and the powers and will join Kerry in Geneva before resuming talks in the Austrian capital. The deal sought by the powers would have Iran accept limits to its uranium enrichment capacity and open up to unfettered IAEA inspections to help ensure it could not put its nuclear program to developing bombs. They also want Iran to resolve all IAEA questions to build trust in its nuclear aspirations. In return, OPEC member Iran would see a lifting of international sanctions that hobbled its oil-based economy. A tentative agreement was reached between Iran, the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China on April 2. But pivotal issues remain unresolved, including the pace of easing Western sanctions and the extent of monitoring and verification measures to ensure Iran honors any agreement.

News article:
Tehran, Iran, May 30 By Mehdi Sepahvand - Trend: Iran has said that a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the Iranian nuclear program contains legal problems. Behrooz Kamalvandi, deputy head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said that the report is repetitive and contains unfounded accusations, Mehr news agency reported May 30. The report is going to be referred to the UN Security Council Board of Directors next week. Referring to IAEA Secretary General Yukiya Amano's statement of inability to express any idea about Iran's "unannounced" nuclear activities, Kamalvandi said that the issue can be addressed via the Additional Protocol to the NPT and furthermore, Iran believes its activities are peaceful, something the IAEA also confirms. He also pointed to the impression that the IAEA may have the authority to inspect any place in Iran at any time and said that the impression is not true. "Even the Additional Protocol would not give the IAEA such a privilege, neither about Iran nor about any other country," Kamalvandi asserted. Commenting on IAEA request to visit Iran's Parchin military site, Kamalvandi said that upon a request by the agency in 2011, a report was filed that listed people, documents, and places demanded by the IAEA in 23 items. Access was given so as to give the IAEA the chance to say that it has had no unvisited place. "Under situations when we are holding talks with the group 5+1 (the US, UK, France, Russia, China, and Germany) as UN Security Council members and have granted that Iran's peaceful activities be continued with some voluntary limitations, the IAEA points to the issue of the suspension of our activities in the Security Council," Kamalvandi said. "If the IAEA considers UN Security Council resolutions, then it must take into consideration the agreements we had with the 5+1 as well. Therefore, the IAEA secretary general's report has problems," he concluded. Edited by CN Follow the author on Twitter: @mehdisepahvand

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print The UN atomic watchdog chief called Monday on Iran to cooperate more in a probe into nuclear weapons activity, a key part in a possible nuclear deal with world powers. The International Atomic Energy Agency “remains ready to accelerate the resolution of all outstanding issues,” agency head Yukiya Amano told a regular meeting of the IAEA’s board of governors in Vienna. “This can be realized by increased cooperation by Iran and by timely provision of access to all relevant information, documentation, sites material and personnel in Iran,” Amano said according to the text of his speech. The IAEA also wants the Iranian regime to answer about conducting research into making a nuclear weapon. An IAEA probe into the “possible military dimensions” (PMD) has been stalled since last August. Western powers say that advancing the investigation is a vital part of the hoped-for June 30 deal, which would see Iran scale down its nuclear program in return from relief from sanctions. A statement from Iran and the six powers in Lausanne said that under the final accord, the IAEA would “be permitted the use of modern technologies and will have enhanced access through agreed procedures, including to clarify past and present issues”. Amano said Monday that clearing up the allegations is “possible within a reasonable timeframe if Iran implements the measures envisaged” in Lausanne. He also said that Iran’s implementation of the Additional Protocol of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty would “significantly increase the agency’s ability to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in the country”. Meanwhile, the European Union is telling the Iranian regime to cooperate with a stalled U.N. probe, according to a copy of EU statement The Associated Press has obtained. The EU statement says getting to the bottom of the probe “will be essential” to a nuclear deal. #Iran #IAEA #IranDeal #IranTalks #Nuclear

UN experts: No country reports Iran arms embargo violation UNITED NATIONS (AP) — U.N. experts said in a report circulated Tuesday that not a single country has reported any violations of an arms embargo against Iran, possibly the result of a political decision to avoid any "negative impact" on negotiations to rein in Tehran's nuclear program. The panel of experts monitoring sanctions against Iran said in the final report on its year-long mandate that the "drastic reduction in reporting and information-sharing" by governments could also reflect a reduction in Iran's efforts to buy banned materials. But it cited several sanctions violations that were not reported and quoted some unnamed countries as saying Tehran's previous attempts to circumvent the bans remain basically unchanged. The report's release coincided with the Security Council's unanimous approval of a resolution extending the mandate of the panel of experts until July 9, 2016. It came just three week before the June 30 deadline for Iran to reach a deal with six world powers that would put long-term caps on its present nuclear activities and lift some sanctions. The Security Council has imposed four rounds of sanctions against Iran because of concerns it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons, and its refusal to suspend enrichment. Tehran claims its nuclear program is peaceful and exists only to produce energy for civilian use. The sanctions, which have chipped away at Iran's economy, include a ban on the import of nuclear and missile-related materials and travel bans and the freezing of assets on listed individuals and companies. The panel said the commitment by member states to implement sanctions has exerted "a definite influence" on the negotiations, noting the "high expectations of a final agreement." While the panel said Iran has "implemented its commitments" under a deal with the six Western countries to curb its nuclear program in exchange for a limited easing of economic sanctions during the negotiations, its questioning of the failure to report any new violations in Tehran's procurement efforts is likely to raise questions in the United States and among its key European allies. Although no country reported a travel ban violation, the panel cited media reports and published several photos of Maj. Gen. Ghasem Soleimani, commander of the elite Quds Force in Iran's Revolutionary Guard, showing that he traveled to Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Soleimani, who has been on the U.N. sanctions blacklist since 2007, "was reportedly organizing and training militia and regular forces in those countries," the panel said. He was also shown on a magazine cover as a commander fighting the Islamic State group in Iraq, it said. The experts said they were investigating a report from an unnamed member state that an Iranian approached a company in January 2015 trying to buy compressors, which are used in the oil and gas industry but can also be used to extract enriched uranium from centrifuges that could be used to fuel nuclear missiles. The experts said they haven't had time to investigate a report from Britain on April 20 that it "is aware of an active Iranian nuclear procurement network which has been associated with Iran's Centrifuge Technology Company and Kalay Electric Company," which is under U.N. sanctions. Iran has also sent arms to Iraq, according to the report. It said Massoud Barzani, president of Iraq's Kurdistan regional government, confirmed last August that Iran had supplied its fighters with weapons and ammunition, a period coinciding with the Islamic State extremist group's capture of swaths of territory in Iraq. It said Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also confirmed sending equipment to Iraq. It also cited a recent media report quoting a U.S. official saying Iran sent Iraq advanced weapons including rockets and missiles. The report lists arms shipments to Yemen dating back to 2009 — including recent reported shipments to Houthi Shiite rebels fighting the country's government.

News article:
United Nations monitors have said that governments are not reporting new incidents of Iran violating Security Council sanctions, even though some have unfolded in plain sight. The monitors’ claims were made in a report dated June 1, the contents of which were made public by Bloomberg news on Tuesday. “The current situation with reporting could reflect a general reduction of procurement activities by the Iranian side or a political decision by some member states to refrain from reporting to avoid a possible negative impact on ongoing negotiations” between Iran and six world powers, said the panel of experts for the UN committee on Iran sanctions in its latest report. While the panel found that Iran “implemented its commitments” under an interim framework easing economic sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear activities, the report raised questions about whether countries, including the U.S. and its European allies, have looked the other way on some sanctions violations, according to Bloomberg. For example, no country reported that General Qassem Suleimani, commander of the elite Quds force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, violated a UN-mandated travel ban despite “a number of media reports with photographs and videos” showing him in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, “reportedly organizing and training militia and regular forces in those countries.” The report included examples of such photos, noted Bloomberg. “This is a clear political decision not to publicize these examples of sanctions evasion in order to ensure that public reporting on this doesn’t in any way jeopardize the talks or harden congressional resolve,” said Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who has advised Congress on expanding sanctions, in an interview. “The Obama administration has bent over backwards to try and whitewash Iranian violations both on the nuclear side and also on the sanction-busting side,” he told Bloomberg. One country that was not named also reported that Iran tried to import a nuclear compressor illegally, the panel said, adding that it didn’t have enough time to investigate the information for this report. Two unnamed governments informed the panel that Iran was carrying out nuclear procurement-related financial transactions through banks outside Iran that aren’t under sanctions. Iranian businessmen acquired majority shares in one of the banks in 2011, according to the report. Bloomberg also noted that the report provides fresh ammunition for critics, including Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and members of both parties in the American Congress who say that President Barack Obama and America’s allies are too eager for a deal with Iran. The report comes as Iran and the six world powers are holding ongoing discussions aimed at turning a preliminary deal into a permanent one by a June 30 deadline. The sides made a major breakthrough at talks with Iran on April 2 by agreeing on the parameters for a final deal to scale back its nuclear capabilities, but still have a series of technical issues to resolve by the looming deadline. The issue of the sanctions on Iran is one of the issues of contention between the sides. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has demanded that sanctions be immediately lifted when any deal is signed, while the West has rejected that demand.

News article:
Washington – Secret escorts. Hiding out. Back farm roads. Military jets. All in the name of a little mystery. President Donald Trump announced last week via Twitter that he’d name his choice to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat on Tuesday. With that, the race was on to find out which of his short-listers made the cut. White House counsel Don McGahn had to break the news to the other finalists — Judges Thomas Hardiman, Judge William Pryor and Amul Thapar all received calls to say they wouldn’t succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia. But when Judge Neil Gorsuch’s phone rang on Monday, it was the president himself calling to invite him to Washington for the big announcement, according to White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who told reporters Tuesday about their plan. Almost instantly, the wheels were set in motion to get Gorsuch and his wife, Louise, to Washington with as much secrecy as possible. The U.S. 10th Circuit judge first paid his neighbor in Boulder, Colorado a visit — during which time, members of the White House counsel were on their way from Washington to Colorado to escort the soon-to-be Supreme Court nominee. From there, Gorsuch and his wife were met by White House counsel staff, who drove them along “a back farm road” between Boulder and Denver, Spicer said. Within a few hours of getting word that he was Trump’s pick for the Court, he was in Denver, boarding a military jet with White House staff, en route to Washington. Even in Washington, he avoided staying at any hotels, instead laying low at the home of friends until it was time to head to the White House for the announcement. On the flight over, Spicer said White House officials prepared him for the hefty job ahead — that is, the uphill fight he’ll face to get confirmed. Spicer says, the White House staff went to great lengths to keep their plan as much of a secret as possible — especially from the media. “You saw a very well planned out and executed strategy tonight,” Spicer said following Tuesday’s ceremony when Trump announced Gorsuch as his pick for the high court. And now comes the hard part. On Wednesday, Gorsuch hits the ground running on Capitol Hill, to begin meetings with various groups and individuals, including members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

News article:
Washington (AFP) - National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's political future was thrown into serious doubt, when the White House said President Donald Trump was "evaluating" the aide's contacts with the Russian government. At Trump's behest, press secretary Sean Spicer issued a statement saying that the president was looking into Flynn's private discussions with Moscow's ambassador to Washington and subsequent actions. Flynn -- the former head of defense intelligence whose encounters with Russian President Vladimir Putin have already drawn criticism -- is accused of discussing the Obama administration's election-hacking-related sanctions with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn had initially claimed he did not discuss sanctions, prompting Vice President Mike Pence to publicly come to his defense. Flynn now stands accused of inappropriate contacts with a foreign government and of misleading the vice president of the United States. White House officials said that Flynn has since apologized to Pence. "The president is evaluating the situation," Spicer said, indicating that Trump was speaking to Pence and "various other people about what he considers the single most important subject there is -- our national security." In the cutthroat world of Washington politics, that could spell the beginning of the end, despite other Trump aides suggesting that Flynn has the full support of the president. The White House on Monday said that there was nothing wrong with Flynn contacting other governments per se. "I think general Flynn both during the transition and after, just as part of the job of national security advisor, is to speak with counterparts," said Spicer. But he was quick to distance the president from any talk of sanctions -- which could be seen as undermining then president Barack Obama's policy and a potential breach of the law. Asked if the president was aware that Flynn would discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador, Spicer said: "No, absolutely not. No way." Story continues - From inner circle to... ? - Until now, Flynn has been an instrumental player in Trump's inner circle. He was an early supporter of Trump's improbable bid for the presidency and has encouraged tougher policies on Iran and a softer policy on Russia.

Washington (AFP) - National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's political future was thrown into serious doubt, when the White House said President Donald Trump was "evaluating" the aide's contacts with the Russian government. At Trump's behest, press secretary Sean Spicer issued a statement saying that the president was looking into Flynn's private discussions with Moscow's ambassador to Washington and subsequent actions. Flynn -- the former head of defense intelligence whose encounters with Russian President Vladimir Putin have already drawn criticism -- is accused of discussing the Obama administration's election-hacking-related sanctions with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn had initially claimed he did not discuss sanctions, prompting Vice President Mike Pence to publicly come to his defense. Flynn now stands accused of inappropriate contacts with a foreign government and of misleading the vice president of the United States. White House officials said that Flynn has since apologized to Pence. "The president is evaluating the situation," Spicer said, indicating that Trump was speaking to Pence and "various other people about what he considers the single most important subject there is -- our national security." In the cutthroat world of Washington politics, that could spell the beginning of the end, despite other Trump aides suggesting that Flynn has the full support of the president. The White House on Monday said that there was nothing wrong with Flynn contacting other governments per se. "I think general Flynn both during the transition and after, just as part of the job of national security advisor, is to speak with counterparts," said Spicer. But he was quick to distance the president from any talk of sanctions -- which could be seen as undermining then president Barack Obama's policy and a potential breach of the law. Asked if the president was aware that Flynn would discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador, Spicer said: "No, absolutely not. No way." Story continues - From inner circle to... ? - Until now, Flynn has been an instrumental player in Trump's inner circle. He was an early supporter of Trump's improbable bid for the presidency and has encouraged tougher policies on Iran and a softer policy on Russia. That was a sharp break with the Obama administration, which introduced a wave of sanctions against Moscow over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea, support for separatists in eastern Ukraine and what US intelligence says were its attempts to sway the 2016 election in Trump's favor.

WASHINGTON - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu landed in Washington Monday evening ahead of a meeting with President Donald Trump on Wednesday that may be overshadowed by an unprecedented internal crisis in the White House surrounding the resignation of Trump's National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. >>> Get all updates on Israel and President Trump: Download our free App, and Subscribe >>> Flynn announced his resignation over his connections to the Russian government and conversations that took place with the Russian Ambassador in Washington, Sergei Kisliak, during the transition period between Trump's November 2016 election and his January 2017 inauguration. In the conversations, Flynn spoke with Kisliak regarding the possibility that Trump would remove American sanctions currently in place against Russia, leading the FBI and other sources in the American intelligence community to carry out investigations of Flynn's connections to the Russians. The final revelation that led to Flynn's resignation was the fact that he decieved Vice President Mike Pence regarding the nature of his conversations with the ambassador. Open gallery view Donald Trump's former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, February 13, 2017. Credit: SAUL LOEB/AFP >> Must read analyses on Trump-Netanyahu meeting: Weak and trapped, Netanyahu will have to tiptoe around Trump | On eve of Netanyahu summit, will peace fans whitewash Trump? | The Israeli right voted for Trump but got Obama >> Flynn was a central figure in setting up the meeting between Trump and Netanyahu. Mossad Director Yossi Cohen and acting national security adviser Jacob Nagel met twice with Flynn since Trump's election victory. The first round of meetings took place in early December 2016 and the second came in the middle of January 2017, just a few days before Trump's swearing in. In both rounds of talks, Cohen and Nagel briefed Flynn on a series of strategic political and security issues and shared with him Israeli intelligence assessments on issues such as Iran's nuclear program, the civil war in Syria and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On Friday and Monday, a third round of meetings was held between Nagel and Flynn in order to finish the preparations for Netanyahu's meeting with Trump. It remains unclear how Flynn's resignation will affect the meeting between Trump and Netanyahu, but in light of the central role he played in preparing the summit between the two leaders, it can be assumed that it will have some certain effect. In addition, Flynn's resignation threw the White House into a particularly volatile crisis. President Trump appointed General Keith Kellogg as acting national security adviser and is expected to spend the next day attempting to find a permanent replacement for Flynn as soon as possible. One of the leading candidates for the position is former CIA director General David Petraeus, who's expected to meet with Trump over the course of the day. Netanyahu spoke with reporters accompanying him on the flight to the U.S. Upon arriving at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, Netanyahu told Israel's Channel 2 that he has "only good expectations" for his meeting with Trump. During the flight, officials in the Prime Minister's Office told reporters that Netanyahu is quite angry over leaks from Sunday's security-cabinet meeting, where ministers discussed the policy that Netanyahu would present to Trump during their meeting. Yoav Horowitz, Netanyahu's chief of staff, told reporters that leaks from the meeting, particularly those concerning President Trump, cause political damage to Israel and could sabotage the meeting. Horowitz said he is not ruling out an investigation of the leaks, including polygraph tests of the ministers present.

Donald Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned amid controversy over his contacts with the Russian government, a first stunning departure from the president's inner circle less than a month after his inauguration. The White House late Monday said Trump had accepted Flynn's resignation amid allegations the retired three star general discussed US sanctions strategy with Russia's ambassador Sergey Kislyak before taking office. Flynn -- who once headed US military intelligence -- insisted he was honored to have served the American people in such a "distinguished" manner. But he admitted that he "inadvertently briefed" the now Vice President Mike Pence with "incomplete information" about his calls with Kislyak. Pence had publicly defended Flynn, saying he did not discuss sanctions, putting his own credibility into question. "Regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology," read Flynn's letter, a copy of which was released by the White House. The White House said Trump has named retired lieutenant general Joseph Kellogg, a decorated Vietnam war veteran who was serving as a director on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to be interim national security advisor. Flynn's resignation so early in a US administration is unprecedented, and comes after details of his calls with the Russian diplomat were made public -- increasing pressure on Trump to take action. Several US media outlets on Monday reported that top Trump advisers were warned about Flynn's contacts with the Russians early this year. Questions will now be raised about who knew about the calls, and why Trump did not move earlier to replace Flynn. Flynn's resignation will also fuel calls for an independent investigation into Russia's influence during the 2016 US presidential election. Earlier in the day White House spokesman Sean Spicer insisted Trump was not consulted about Flynn discussing sanctions, nor did he task Flynn to do so. Asked if Trump was aware Flynn would discuss sanctions with the Russian envoy, Spicer said: "No, absolutely not. No way." A former head of defense intelligence, Flynn's encounters with Russian President Vladimir Putin had already drawn criticism. US media reported Monday that the Justice Department had warned the White House that Flynn had misled senior administration officials about the contents of his talks with Kislyak, and that it could make him vulnerable to Russian blackmail. The message was delivered in the last days of Barack Obama's administration by then-acting attorney general Sally Yates -- who Trump sacked after she instructed Justice Department lawyers not to defend his contested travel ban. CNN said then director of national intelligence James Clapper and John Brennan, the CIA chief at the time, agreed the White House should be alerted about the concerns. In the hours before his resignation, some Trump aides suggested that Flynn had the full support of the president. Until now, Flynn had been an instrumental player in Trump's inner circle. He was an early supporter of Trump's improbable bid for the presidency and has encouraged tougher policies on Iran and a softer policy on Russia.

Washington and Moscow had also clashed over alleged war crimes in Syria, where Russia is accused of aiding the bombing of hospitals and other civilian targets. Despite this, Flynn had argued for rapprochement. A few of Trump's fellow Republicans had joined their Democratic foes in urging Flynn to resign over a situation that had become a major embarrassment for the ruling party. "It is his duty to be fully transparent and forthright in his actions -- anything less is unacceptable," Representative Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican, said in a statement. "If in fact he purposely misled the president, he should step down immediately." Flynn's resignation took place just days before his first official talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, discussions in which the president's national security advisor would normally have a key role.

He added that "this resignation shows some weakness of the new US Administration" and that "in this case, Trump and his team were not willing to use political leverage to defend their position." Olevich was echoed by Pavel Podlesny from the Moscow-based Institute for US and Canadian Studies, who said Flynn's resignation is the result of internal conflicts within the new US Administration. "The Trump Administration includes a whole array of people with different views who have never met before. So there may be some mutual friction and disagreements caused by any plausible pretext," he said. Podlesny added that the 1799 Logan Act was used in order to drive another wedge between the United States and Russia and complicate the work of the new US Administration. "Yes, Flynn called the Russian Ambassador in Washington, but these were not formal negotiations. This was a pretext to remove the man who called for the improvement of Washington's relations with Russia," he pointed out. Michael Maloof, for his part, said that the resignation of Michael Flynn is an unfortunate development, and something that can be called a victory for the Democrats. "This is a victory of [the US] mainstream media and the Democrats. They dislike the current Administration so they will do their best to prove its unreliability. This is just the beginning," he said. He recalled that from the very beginning, the US elite wereopposed to Flynn's nomination and the fact that Flynn appeared on RT as a political analyst only added fuel to the fire. Meanwhile, the US political journalism website Washington Free Beacon has reported that members of the former US Administration allegedly conducted "a secret, months-long campaign" to discredit Michael Flynn. The Washington Free Beacon referred to "multiple sources in and out of the White House who described… a behind-the-scenes effort by these officials to plant a series of damaging stories about Flynn in the national media." "The operation primarily focused on discrediting Flynn, an opponent of the Iran nuclear deal, in order to handicap the Trump Administration's efforts to disclose secret details of the nuclear deal with Iran that had been long hidden by the Obama administration," the Washington Free Beacon said.

News article:
The abrupt resignation Monday evening of White House national security adviser Michael Flynn is the culmination of a secret, months-long campaign by former Obama administration confidantes to handicap President Donald Trump’s national security apparatus and preserve the nuclear deal with Iran, according to multiple sources in and out of the White House who described to the Washington Free Beacon a behind-the-scenes effort by these officials to plant a series of damaging stories about Flynn in the national media. The effort, said to include former Obama administration adviser Ben Rhodes—the architect of a separate White House effort to create what he described as a pro-Iran echo chamber—included a small task force of Obama loyalists who deluged media outlets with stories aimed at eroding Flynn’s credibility, multiple sources revealed. The operation primarily focused on discrediting Flynn, an opponent of the Iran nuclear deal, in order to handicap the Trump administration’s efforts to disclose secret details of the nuclear deal with Iran that had been long hidden by the Obama administration. Insiders familiar with the anti-Flynn campaign told the Free Beacon that these Obama loyalists plotted in the months before Trump’s inauguration to establish a set of roadblocks before Trump’s national security team, which includes several prominent opponents of diplomacy with Iran. The Free Beacon first reported on this effort in January. Sources who spoke to the Free Beacon requested anonymity in order to speak freely about the situation and avoid interfering with the White House’s official narrative about Flynn, which centers on his failure to adequately inform the president about a series of phone calls with Russian officials. Flynn took credit for his missteps regarding these phone calls in a brief statement released late Monday evening. Trump administration officials subsequently stated that Flynn’s efforts to mislead the president and vice president about his contacts with Russia could not be tolerated. However, multiple sources closely involved in the situation pointed to a larger, more secretive campaign aimed at discrediting Flynn and undermining the Trump White House. “It’s undeniable that the campaign to discredit Flynn was well underway before Inauguration Day, with a very troublesome and politicized series of leaks designed to undermine him,” said one veteran national security adviser with close ties to the White House team. “This pattern reminds me of the lead up to the Iran deal, and probably features the same cast of characters.” The Free Beacon first reported in January that, until its final days in office, the Obama administration hosted several pro-Iran voices who were critical in helping to mislead the American public about the terms of the nuclear agreement. This included a former Iranian government official and the head of the National Iranian American Council, or NIAC, which has been accused of serving as Iran’s mouthpiece in Washington, D.C. Since then, top members of the Obama administration’s national security team have launched a communications infrastructure after they left the White House, and have told reporters they are using that infrastructure to undermine Trump’s foreign policy. “It’s actually Ben Rhodes, NIAC, and the Iranian mullahs who are celebrating today,” said one veteran foreign policy insider who is close to Flynn and the White House. “They know that the number one target is Iran … [and] they all knew their little sacred agreement with Iran was going to go off the books. So they got rid of Flynn before any of the [secret] agreements even surfaced.” Flynn had been preparing to publicize many of the details about the nuclear deal that had been intentionally hidden by the Obama administration as part of its effort to garner support for the deal, these sources said. Flynn is now “gone before anybody can see what happened” with these secret agreements, said the second insider close to Flynn and the White House. Sources in and out of the White House are concerned that the campaign against Flynn will be extended to other prominent figures in the Trump administration. One senior White House official told the Free Beacon that leaks targeting the former official were “not the result of a series of random events.” “The drumbeat of leaks of sensitive material related to General Flynn has been building since he was named to his position,” said the official, who is a member of the White House’s National Security Council. “Last night was not the result of a series of random events. The president has lost a valuable adviser and we need to make sure this sort of thing does not happen again.” Other sources expressed concern that public trust in the intelligence community would be eroded by the actions of employees with anti-Trump agendas. “The larger issue that should trouble the American people is the far-reaching power of unknown, unelected apparatchiks in the Intelligence Community deciding for themselves both who serves in government and what is an acceptable policy they will allow the elected representatives of the people to pursue,” said the national security adviser quoted above. “Put aside the issue of Flynn himself; that nameless, faceless bureaucrats were able to take out a president’s national security adviser based on a campaign of innuendo without evidence should worry every American,” the source explained. Eli Lake, a Bloomberg View columnist and veteran national security reporter well sourced in the White House, told the Free Beacon that Flynn earned a reputation in the Obama administration as one of its top detractors. “Michael Flynn was one of the Obama administration’s fiercest critics after he was forced out of the Defense Intelligence Agency,” said Lake, who described “ the political assassination of Michael Flynn ” in his column published early Tuesday. “[Flynn] was a withering critic of Obama’s biggest foreign policy initiative, the Iran deal,” Lake said. “He also publicly accused the administration of keeping classified documents found in the Osama bin Laden raid that showed Iran’s close relationship with al Qaeda. He was a thorn in their side.” Lake noted in his column that he does not buy fully the White House’s official spin on Flynn’s resignation. “For a White House that has such a casual and opportunistic relationship with the truth, it’s strange that Flynn’s ‘lie’ to Pence would get him fired,” Lake wrote. “It doesn’t add up.” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer stated in his daily briefing that “the evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable incidents is what led the president to ask General Flynn for his resignation.” A third source who serves as a congressional adviser and was involved in the 2015 fight over the Iran deal told the Free Beacon that the Obama administration feared that Flynn would expose the secret agreements with Iran. “The Obama administration knew that Flynn was going to release the secret documents around the Iran deal, which would blow up their myth that it was a good deal that rolled back Iran,” the source said. “So in December the Obama NSC started going to work with their favorite reporters, selectively leaking damaging and incomplete information about Flynn.” “After Trump was inaugurated some of those people stayed in and some began working from the outside, and they cooperated to keep undermining Trump,” the source said, detailing a series of leaks from within the White House in the past weeks targeting Flynn. “Last night’s resignation was their first major win, but unless the Trump people get serious about cleaning house, it won’t be the last.”

By bringing more and more accusations against US President Donald Trump's team, the Democratic Party tries to create preconditions for the President's impeachment, Vladimir Vasiliev, a senior fellow at the Institute of the USA and Canada, believes.

The media outlet claimed that one of Trump's advisors allegedly spotted communicating with Russian security agents was Paul Manafort. However, Manafort dismissed the allegations dubbing them as "absurd."

Staff at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have been told that President Trump is preparing a handful of executive orders to reshape the agency, to be signed once a new administrator is confirmed, two sources who attended the meeting told Reuters on Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Wednesday dropped a U.S. commitment to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the longstanding bedrock of Washington's Middle East policy, even as he urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to curb settlement construction. “I’m looking at two states and one state, and I like the one both parties like,” Trump told a joint news conference with Netanyahu. “I can live with either one.” Contemplation U.S. first lady Melania Trump and Sara Netanyahu look at the Contemplative Court fountain during a visit to the African American Museum of History and Culture in Washington, U.S., February 15, 2017.

News article:
With enemies like Jake Tapper, President Donald Trump really doesn’t need friends. As a candidate, and now as president, one of Donald Trump’s recurring themes has been that the majority of the big media outlets have been unfair and biased against him. Since becoming president, that theme has become, if anything, even more prominent in Mr. Trump’s public statements. “Fake news” and the “dishonesty” of the press coverage of the new administration are constant complaints streaming from the White House. The friction between the Trump administration and the Washington press corps most recently erupted last Friday when press secretary Sean Spicer invited certain news outlets into his office for a “gaggle”—an un-televised news conference—while leaving other outlets uninvited and excluded. {mosads}Among the excluded news sites were CNN, The New York Times, The Hill, Politico, BuzzFeed, the Daily Mail, BBC, the Los Angeles Times and the New York Daily News. The Trump administration has made it perfectly clear that it wants to portray a big segment of the media as enemies of both the administration and, as Trump has said, of “the people.” There can be no doubt that the Trump administration, at the very highest levels, has decided that portraying the so-called “mainstream-media” as the enemy is a winning strategy. The media, when confronted with that kind of a White House tactic, has a choice to make. Does it continue to try to do its job in as fair, truthful, and objective way as it can, or does it in effect accept the Trump administration premise that the media and the administration are enemies? That is, does it abandon all efforts to even appear to be fair and simply exchange blows with the administration, tit for tat? One might think that mature, thoughtful people who have made it their profession to report the news would be able to resist the impulse to get into a mudslinging contest with the new president. One might think that, but let me tell you about Jake Tapper. On Saturday, the New York Times published a story about the new administration’s relations with the press. In that story, reference was made to the fact that press secretary Sean Spicer was born in New England. As it turns out, the story was incorrect. Mr. Spicer was not born in New England. So, in what was no doubt an effort to reinforce the theme that the main-stream-media is frequently a source of “fake news,” Spicer tweeted that the New York Times “can’t even get where I was born right and failed to ask.” Later, the Times published a correction. What we had here was a relatively minor dust-up between the New York Times and Sean Spicer, the press secretary for the Trump administration. The controversy had nothing to do with CNN—not one thing. It was just Sean Spicer tweaking the Times, and that was all. Enter Jake Tapper. From out of nowhere, a couple of hours after Spicer tweeted his complaints about the inaccurate Times story, Jake Tapper tweets to Spicer: I imagine it must be really annoying when someone puts out false info about where you were born. Must really bother you!! cc @BarackObama https://t.co/BCQAWiEksB — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 25, 2017 And he ever-so-subtly copies that tweet to former-President Barack Obama’s twitter account. So here is Jake Tapper, a leading luminary of CNN, spontaneously barging into a brouhaha between Sean Spicer and the New York Times, and somehow attributing to Spicer the “birther” controversies that Mr. Trump was so active in stirring up even before he began his campaign for the presidency. Of course, Sean Spicer was not acting as Mr. Trump’s spokesman when the latter was questioning whether Mr. Obama had been born in Hawaii. I don’t know whether Mr. Trump and Mr. Spicer even knew each other at that time. But, what is remarkable here is that Jake Tapper, one of the CNN heavyweights, decided to volunteer himself for a role that no one had even asked him to play: the role of enemy of the Trump administration. Based on his most recent behavior, one might be forgiven for thinking that Tapper spends all his time, whether at work or at leisure, looking for opportunities to embarrass and insult anyone and everyone in the Trump administration. Trump claims he and his administration can’t get a fair shake at many news outlets, and CNN is perhaps the one he most frequently criticizes for lack of fairness. How does CNN respond? One of its most recognizable and important on-camera figures butts into a matter that has nothing to do with CNN and trolls a senior administration figure. That will certainly go a long way to reassure people that CNN will try to be fair and objective in its reporting. There are many people who think that Trump spends too much of his time engaging in thoughtless, foolish tweeting. Trump may not be the only one. David E.

News article:
Several senators on both sides of the aisle rushed to back Attorney General Jeff Sessions Thursday as he sought to blunt resignation calls from senior Democrats, following revelations he met last year with Russia's ambassador – a detail omitted from recent congressional testimony. His defenders say such meetings between senators and diplomats were routine. And Sessions even got an inadvertent boost from Democratic Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, who in demanding the AG's resignation initially claimed she never called or met with Russia's ambassador -- only for tweets to surface indicating she had, at least twice. Other former colleagues intentionally came to Sessions' defense, backing the former Alabama senator's claim he only met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in his official capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “I’ve met with the Russian ambassador with a group, in my capacity, with a group of other senators,” Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., told CNN. “That’s in my official capacity. That’s nothing. That’s my job.” Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said in a statement that he’d talked to “at least twenty ambassadors in the last six weeks.” “It would have been very normal for Sessions, as a senator, to have talked to the Russian ambassador without discussing the election,” Blunt said. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said on MSNBC that he’d met with “six ambassadors in the last five months.” Though he hadn’t met with Kislyak, Cruz said he would do so without reservations. The statements of support came as other lawmakers -- including the two top-ranking Democrats, Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer -- demanded Sessions' resignation. The calls came in the wake of The Washington Post first reporting that Sessions met with Kislyak in July and September, despite testimony during his confirmation hearing that he had never spoken with Russian officials during the time he was a campaign surrogate for then-GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. Sessions is maintaining he never discussed campaign matters with the Russian ambassador, and the White House has backed him. Sessions, while an Alabama senator, in fact met often with ambassadors from a variety of countries, according to a schedule provided to Fox News by a Department of Justice spokesperson. From April 14 through Nov. 11, Sessions had 30 meetings with ambassadors, including four with the ambassador for Great Britain. The day before then-Sen. Sessions met with Kislyak on Sept. 8, he took a meeting with Ukraine Ambassador Valeriy Chaly. Though it’s unclear what was discussed, the back-to-back meetings occurred a week before Russia accepted a unilateral ceasefire plan in Ukraine on behalf of the separatist rebels it backs there. Seeking to drive a stake into Sessions’ defense, however, McCaskill tweeted Thursday she had “been on the Armed Services Com for 10 years. No call or meeting w/Russian ambassador. Ever. Ambassadors call members of Foreign Rel Com.” Except, that’s not quite true. In a pair of tweets first unearthed by National Review’s Charles C.W. Cooke, McCaskill twice wrote messages about meetings with Kislyak, in 2013 and 2015. “Off to meeting w/Russian Ambassador. Upset about the arbitrary/cruel decision to end all U.S. adoptions, even those in process,” McCaskill tweeted on Jan. 30, 2013. On Aug. 6, 2015, McCaskill wrote: “Today calls with British, Russian, and German ambassadors re: Iran deal. #doingmyhomework.” Today calls with British, Russian, and German Ambassadors re: Iran deal. #doingmyhomework — Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) August 6, 2015 McCaskill later blamed Twitter's character limit for the seeming disparity in her tweets, suggesting the limit prevented her from being more specific in Thursday's tweet. She downplayed the significance of her own conversations with Russia's ambassador.

News article:
Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente will now take over any and all investigations into Russia's potential meddling in the 2016 election now that Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from those matters. In his statement released Thursday, Sessions said Boente "shall act as and perform the functions of the Attorney General with respect to any matters from which I have recused myself to the extent they exist." Boente was appointed to be acting deputy attorney general in late January after President Trump fired Sally Yates for refusing to defend his immigration executive order. A former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Boente is acting deputy attorney general until the president's nominee, Rod Rosenstein is confirmed. Rosenstein, the current U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, goes before the Senate Judiciary Committee next Tuesday. Boente, 62, was nominated by former President Barack Obama for his role in the Eastern District of Virginia and has worked for the DOJ for more than three decades. The Eastern District of Virginia is considered a very high-profile district, as it is home to the CIA and the Pentagon. Former AG Loretta Lynch called Boente one of the department's "consummate utility players" who notably led the corruption prosecutions of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, former Louisiana Rep. William J. Jefferson and former New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin. Boente's office in Alexandria, Virginia, did not return a request for comment from the Washington Examiner.

News article:
Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal leaves any Justice Department investigation of alleged Russian election interference temporarily in the hands of an official who began his career as a prosecutor under President Ronald Reagan and was promoted by Barack Obama. Sessions on Thursday stepped aside from taking any role in federal inquiries into Donald Trump's presidential campaign, including whether officials or surrogates had improper contacts with the Russians. Sessions had a meeting last year in his office with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, which he said was unrelated to the campaign. That means it's the job of Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente to oversee any investigations related to the presidential campaigns by the FBI or Justice Department attorneys. Boente — who started at the DOJ under Reagan and then rose through the ranks — would give up that authority when and if a permanent deputy is confirmed. In 2015, Obama promoted him to U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Virginia. The White House has nominated the U.S. attorney in Baltimore, Rod Rosenstein, a Republican veteran of George W. Bush's administration, to the position. His confirmation hearing is scheduled for Tuesday. Beyond that, the course of any investigation is unclear, and several important questions can't yet be answered. One of them is what Sessions' announcement actually means. Sessions said that he's recusing himself from "any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for president of the United States." Attorney General Jeff Sessions leaves a press conference on Thursday. Nicholas Kamm / AFP - Getty Images The Federal Election Commission categorizes presidential campaigns by campaign cycles, which are generally considered to end on Election Day. By that strict definition, Sessions could say he's withdrawing from any investigation of alleged impropriety occurring up to and including Nov. 8 — and that he could potentially step back in if an allegation surfaces about anything that may have happened later. Sessions left the door open for that possibility in an interview on Fox News on Thursday night. Take, for example, the controversy surrounding Michael Flynn, who resigned as Trump's national security adviser on Feb. 13. NBC News has confirmed that Flynn and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and adviser, had what was described as a "brief courtesy meeting" with Kislyak in December — after Election Day. Asked by Fox News host Tucker Carlson whether his recusal applied to investigations of Flynn, Sessions said: "If something else comes up that's not related to the campaign, we would go through the same process — to see if I should not be involved in the case." So what can the Justice Department do to ensure an independent investigation? It could appoint an independent special counsel to oversee any inquiries — something Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York and many other Democrats urged Boente to do. (Schumer went even further, calling on Sessions to resign.) Special counsels are appointed only in the most sensitive cases. There hasn't even been one since Pat Fitzgerald wrapped up his investigation of who leaked the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame during George W. Bush's presidency. The U.S. Code sets out specific criteria to justify appointing a special counsel. First the attorney general or his or her proxy must determine that a criminal investigation is warranted. President Donald Trump speaks alongside Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Feb. 9. SAUL LOEB / AFP - Getty Images Sessions stressed Thursday that he couldn't confirm or deny that there is any investigation at all. Second, the attorney general or his or her proxy must determine that it would be a conflict of interest for the department or a U.S. attorney's office to conduct the investigation. Both determinations will now be up to Boente or Resenstein. During his years in the Senate representing Alabama Sessions made it clear that he believes special counsels should be appointed to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. As recently as Nov. 5 — three days before the election and more than eight months after he began campaigning for Trump — Sessions co-wrote an editorial column on the Fox News website calling on Loretta Lynch, the attorney general at the time, to appoint a special counsel to investigate Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. "We are concerned about the egregious damage that has been inflicted on two revered government agencies: the Department of Justice and Department of State," Sessions wrote, along with Rudy Giuliani and three other former Justice Department officials. "You should never politicize criminal investigations or prosecutions," Sessions said in an interview on CNBC the next day. Lynch, he said, "knows who appointed her, and she knows whose pleasure she serves at. So we need an independent person, a person that's not politically connected." Boente hasn't spoken publicly about the matter, and it's unlikely that he will. Until and unless he or Rosenstein do, the bottom line is that — as Sessions himself said Thursday night in an interview on Fox News — the process "will just have to play out."

News article:
Washington: When former attorney-general Eric Holder Jr came under fire for leaks of classified information about the Obama administration’s role in authorising cyberattacks against Iran, he turned to a veteran federal prosecutor — a Republican — to help head his investigation into who was leaking. That same federal prosecutor, Rod Rosenstein, is being tapped again, this time by President Donald Trump’s attorney-general, to oversee another high-profile case, the FBI’s investigation into Russian meddling and any links between Russian officials and Trump’s associates. Attorney-General Jeff Sessions recused himself Thursday from the investigation and designated his acting deputy attorney-general, the second-highest-ranking official in the Justice Department, to oversee the probe. But the responsibility is expected to soon fall to Rosenstein, 52, the longest-serving US attorney, whose Senate confirmation hearing to become deputy attorney-general is set for Tuesday. Rosenstein, the sole holdover US attorney from the George W. Bush administration, is widely respected by Democrats and Republicans for his experience working on sensitive cases in the face of political pressure, according to attorneys he has worked with during his nearly three decades in the department. “I cannot imagine a more challenging environment in which to be the deputy attorney-general than what we have now,” said Jason Weinstein, a former Justice Department official who worked with Rosenstein during the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. “And I cannot imagine a better person for the job at this time than Rod. He is not political at all. In every decision he makes — and I’ve seen him make some very difficult ones — the only question he really cares about is what is right and what is just.” A Philadelphia native, Rosenstein began working as a trial attorney in the public integrity section of President George H.W. Bush’s Justice Department after graduating from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review, and clerking for Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Soon afterward, President Bill Clinton’s deputy attorney-general hired Rosenstein to be his counsel. During the Clinton administration, Kenneth Starr tapped him to be his associate independent counsel on the investigation into the business dealings of the Clintons and their associates in the Whitewater Development Corp. Rosenstein stayed on into the George W. Bush administration and in 2005, Bush appointed him US attorney for the US District Court for the District of Maryland, where he remained through Barack Obama’s administration. “He came in under one administration, stayed under another and is now being elevated under yet another,” said George Terwilliger III, the former deputy attorney-general and acting attorney-general under George H.W. Bush. “That tells you everything about the consummate professional that he is.” Beneath Rosenstein’s mild-mannered demeanour is a tough determination, his current and former colleagues say. As the Baltimore US attorney, for example, Rosenstein successfully prosecuted then-Prince George’s County (Maryland) executive Jack Johnson for corruption. Johnson was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2011 after an investigation in which he was heard on a wiretap ordering his wife, Leslie, to flush a $100,000 (Dh367,300) cheque from a developer down the toilet and hide $79,600 in cash in her underwear as FBI agents were knocking on their door with a search warrant. Earlier this week, Rosenstein announced indictments against seven Baltimore police officers in a racketeering conspiracy. Rosenstein is also credited with turning around a troubled US attorney’s office. “He’s calm, deliberative, analytical and — as they used to say on the kindergarten report card — he works and plays well with others,” said former attorney-general Michael Mukasey. It was that reputation that led Holder to tap Rosenstein in 2012 to be one of two US attorneys to oversee the investigations into the leaking of classified national security information. The probe resulted in the former vice-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General James ‘Hoss’ Cartwright, to plead guilty to one felony count of lying to the FBI. “He ran that investigation effectively, vigorously and without any respect for partisanship,” said Robert Litt, former general counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in the Obama administration. “After all, he was going after the guy who was reported in the press to be Obama’s favourite general at a time when Obama was president.” If he is confirmed, Rosenstein — who lives with his wife, an attorney, and two teenage daughters in Bethesda, Maryland — will be responsible for the day-to-day running of the sprawling Justice Department, which has 113,000 employees across the country. The heads of the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will report directly to him. And as of Thursday, he will also take on the oversight of all federal investigations into Russia and the 2016 presidential election.

News article:
By Chemi Shalev (Haaretz) March 5, 2017 Donald Trump’s relatively calm and controlled speech to Congress last week caused several analysts, including this one, to wonder whether the President might turn a corner and henceforth stop his loony outbursts. It took only a day or two for Trump to respond with a resounding and emphatic “No!” His series of spectacularly raving tweets on Saturday made clear not only that the U.S. president has no intention of behaving reasonably and responsibly, but the increasing pressure of his so-called Russiagate affair is making him go bonkers more than ever before. Trump accused Barack Obama of wiretapping phones at his campaign headquarters at Trump Tower in Manhattan in October. He can’t make up his mind whether that makes the former President bad or sick. He thinks it’s like Watergate, which is somehow understandable, but also like McCarthyism, an analogy that challenges even the most fawning and flexible of historians. In between one ludicrous allegation and another, Trump found time to deal with the cardinal question of whether Arnold Schwarzenegger resigned or was fired as his replacement on “The Apprentice.” Seriously, you can’t make this up, no matter how hard you try. Cynical American commentators – like their Israeli counterparts who proclaim Benjamin Netanyahu a “magician” every time he incites against Arabs or leftists in order to divert attention from some embarrassment – explained once again that Trump is creating a ruckus so that the media will deal with his tweets rather than with his ties to the Kremlin or with the false statements made by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to Congress about his meetings with the Russian ambassador. According to his logic, Trump doesn’t mind if the “mainstream media” views him as the village idiot, as long as it stops digging around in his affairs. His “base,” which eagerly lapped up his lies about Obama’s birthplace, will be just as happy with any other cock-and-bull accusation, ludicrous as it may be. Another explanation is linked to Trump’s exceedingly thin skin. The current barrage of unhinged tweets, according to this view, is a direct result of his anger at the fact that his honeymoon with the media in the wake of his speech to Congress was cut short so quickly because of the Sessions scandal. Trump was reportedly incensed with Session’s announcement on Thursday that he would recuse himself from investigations of Trump-Russia ties, because in Trump’s world, one never apologizes or admits a mistake but always attacks, attacks, attacks instead. But all such explanations about the inner purpose of Trump’s paroxysms and all of the reports that Trump based his attack on another story that appeared on the controversial Breitbart website are dwarfed by a possibility that seems just as feasible as all the rest: that Trump is right. Not that Obama tapped his phones, but that federal agents did. There have been sporadic reports to that effect in several news outlets, including the Guardian, but this would be the first official confirmation. Thus, Trump may have taken the lid off a pressure cooker that will soon blow up in his face. True, some people who believe Obama capable of anything will have no problem advancing the theory that the former president hired his own group of Watergate-style “plumbers” to eavesdrop on the Republican candidate, though only God and Trump would know for what purpose. Trump’s tweets, however, refer to a “lower court” that failed to approve a request for wiretapping his headquarters, which means that a higher court did. That means that the FBI, after being duly authorized by the Justice Department, succeeded in convincing a special tribunal set up in accordance with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that despite the danger of being accused of improper interference in the political process, there was enough “probable cause” to suspect that Trump and/or his underlings were in contact with a foreign entity or foreign intelligence service (and we all know who that might be). If this is the case, then Trump himself may have offered the noose from which he might ultimately hang, politically speaking. As soon as Washington recovers from another one of its recurring shocks, there is certain to be a growing demand to expose the material on which the FBI based its surveillance request, if it exists, and what it may have found out, if the wiretapping took place. Democrats will be particularly incensed to learn that while FBI Director James Comey was concealing the possibility that the GOP presidential candidate might be guilty of treason, he found it necessary to publicize an extremely damaging letter about Hillary Clinton’s emails just nine days before the elections. The new mayhem will undoubtedly expand polarization in Washington as many Republicans jump to Trump’s defense. But it takes only a few Republicans who haven’t lost their conscience to turn the demand for an independent investigation of Russiagate affair into an ultimatum that can’t be refused. It’s tempting to say that Trump, in his mindless impetuousness, has hurt himself. Instead of trying to shift the media’s focus from his Russia ties to other matters, he has now ensured that it will intensify, get ugly and stay around much longer. But there’s always the possibility that Trump knows very well that this affair isn’t going to go anywhere until it is resolved and until it exacts its toll, which, in this case, could be his presidency.

News article:
Washington – U.S. President Donald Trump has almost certainly not spoken to FBI Director James Comey about the president’s claim that the previous administration wiretapped him during the 2016 election campaign, the White House said on Monday. Federal Bureau of Investigation head James Comey has asked the Justice Department to reject Trump’s accusation that former President Barack Obama ordered a wiretap at Trump Tower in New York because the claim was false and must be corrected, a federal law enforcement official said. White House Spokesman Sean Spicer said he was “almost 100 percent certain” Trump had not spoken to Comey since the Republican president made the allegation on Twitter on Saturday. “I’m not aware that that occurred,” Spicer told reporters. Trump gave no evidence for his claim, the latest twist in a controversy over ties between Trump associates and Russia that has dogged the early days of his presidency. The wiretapping allegation hit U.S. stocks on Monday. Some investors worried that the affair could distract Trump from his economic agenda of introducing tax cuts and simplifying regulations that has powered a record-setting rally on Wall Street since the election. The lack of detail on Trump’s proposals, his isolationist stance and setbacks in filling his Cabinet have made investors question whether the post-election rally has run its course. Democrats accused Trump of making the wiretapping claim to try to distract from controversy about possible links to Russia. His administration has come under pressure from FBI and congressional investigations into contacts between members of his campaign team and Russian officials. A Republican lawmaker who heads a House of Representatives oversight panel said on Monday he had seen no direct evidence to back Trump’s wiretapping assertion. “Thus far, I have not seen anything directly that would support what the president has said,” Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told CBS in an interview. The White House asked the Republican-controlled Congress to examine, as part of an ongoing congressional probe into Russia’s influence on the election, whether the Obama administration abused its investigative authority.

News article:
Washington – The White House on Monday appeared to soften President Donald Trump’s unproven assertion that his predecessor wiretapped his New York skyscraper during the election. The shift came as the Justice Department faced a deadline to provide lawmakers evidence to back up Trump’s explosive claim. More than a week after Trump leveled his allegations in a series of early morning tweets, spokesman Sean Spicer said the president wasn’t using the word wiretapping literally, noting that Trump had put the term in quotation marks. “The president used the word wiretap in quotes to mean broadly surveillance and other activities,” Spicer said Monday. He also suggested Trump wasn’t accusing former President Barack Obama specifically, but instead referring to the actions of the Obama administration. Spicer’s evolving explanation underscores the bind Trump has put his own White House in. Current and former administration officials have been unable to provide any evidence of the Obama administration wiretapping Trump Tower, yet the president’s aides have been reluctant to publicly contradict their boss. Trump himself has not commented on the matter since his March 4 tweets, in which he said he had “just found out that Obama had my “wires tapped” in Trump Tower just before the victory.” He also wrote: “Is it legal for a sitting President to be ‘wire tapping’ a race for president?” The president’s accusations against Obama came amid numerous political questions surrounding his associates’ possible ties to Russia. The FBI is investigating Trump associates’ contacts with Russia during the election, as are House and Senate intelligence committees. The White House has asked those committees to also investigate Trump’s unverified wiretapping allegations against Obama. The House committee has turned the matter back on the Trump administration, setting a Monday deadline for the Justice Department to provide evidence. Spicer said he expected the Justice Department to comply with that request. DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said Monday that the department was reviewing the request, “but we don’t have any further comment at this time.” Other congressional committees are also pushing the administration to clarify Trump’s claims. Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., asked Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente and FBI Director James Comey to produce the paper trail created when the Justice Department’s criminal division secures warrants for wiretaps. The senators, who head the Senate Judiciary Committee’s crime and terrorism subcommittee, are seeking warrant applications and court orders, which they said can be scrubbed to protect secret intelligence sources and methods. Trump’s critics have slammed the president for making the wiretapping claim on his Twitter account without evidence. Wiretapping a U.S. citizen would require special permission from a court, and Trump as president would have the ability to declassify that information. Sen. John McCain, an influential Republican, said Sunday: “I think the president has one of two choices: either retract or to provide the information that the American people deserve.” “If his predecessor violated the law, President Obama violated the law, we have got a serious issue here, to say the least,” McCain said. Comey has privately urged the Justice Department to dispute Trump’s claim but has not come forward to do so himself. James Clapper, who was Obama’s director of national intelligence, has said that nothing matching Trump’s claims had taken place. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway sidestepped questions about the lack of proof Monday, saying she was “not in the job of having evidence.” “That’s what investigations are for,” Conway told CNN’s “New Day.” “The president is pleased that the House and Senate intelligence committees have agreed that this should be part of the investigation that already exists about Russia and the campaign, an investigation that apparently has gone nowhere so far.” In a weekend interview with the Bergen Record, a newspaper in her home state of New Jersey, Conway appeared to point toward the recent WikiLeaks release of nearly 8,000 documents that purportedly reveal secrets about the CIA’s tools for breaking into targeted computers, cellphones and even smart TVs. “What I can say is there are many ways to surveil each other now, unfortunately,” including “microwaves that turn into cameras, et cetera,” Conway said. “So we know that that is just a fact of modern life.”

News article:
As the White House attempts to distance itself from former Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort, details of his ties to Russia keep piling up. The Associated Press reported Manafort worked secretly in 2005 to advance Putin’s interests and undermine anti-Russian movements in the former Soviet republics, proposing a media strategy in the United States, Europe and the former Soviet republics, as well as trying to influence politics and business deals. He also tried to win a U.S. visa for Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin with mob ties and one of Russia’s wealthiest men. Deripaska owns Basic Element Co., employing 200,000 people worldwide in everything from agriculture to manufacturing, including aluminum giant UC Rusal. Forbes estimated he is worth $5.2 billion. Read: RT America Should Be Investigated, Jeanne Shaheen Says The revelations come as the FBI and congressional committees investigate possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives, as well as Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. During a hearing Monday, FBI Director James Comey testified the FBI began investigating the Trump campaign in late July, while Manafort was still running Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. The AP reported Manafort signed a $10 million annual contract in 2006 with Deripaska, and the two retained business contacts until at least 2009, a source told the AP. The work was performed under the company name LOAV Ltd., not Manafort’s better known Davis Manafort, and its address was listed as his former home in Alexandria, Virginia. Manafort and Deripaska had a falling out in 2014 over a $19 million investment in Ukrainian TV, the AP said. Read: FBI Wanted To Hire Spy Who Compiled Trump Russian Dossier Years before the 2006 contract, Deripaska asked Manafort to help him obtain a U.S. visa after the U.S. State Department refused to issue one. Manafort Wednesday confirmed he worked for Deripaska but denied his work was pro-Russian in nature. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters the president was unaware of Manafort’s relationship with Deripaska. "To suggest that the president knew who his [Manafort’s] clients were from 10 years ago is a bit insane," Spicer said, calling AP's report " a lot of buzz" and noted Manafort's work occurred long before he joined Trump's campaign. "I don't know what he got paid to do. There's no suggestion he did anything improper."’ Spicer also noted Manafort worked on the George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole campaigns. He also worked on the presidential campaigns of Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. Among foreign leaders, Manafort played a role in Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos 1986 election, which was rife with voter fraud. In 2010, he helped Viktor Yanukovich win the Ukrainian presidency. Spicer Monday tried to say Manafort played only a minor role in last-year’s Trump campaign although he was chairman from March through August before being forced to resign amid reports he had masterminded a covert Washington lobbying effort in 2014 for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. Even after leaving the campaign, Manafort and Trump remained in contact through the November election, Politico noted. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump confidant, told Politico the smartest thing the White House could do is distance itself from Manafort by claiming ignorance of his past dealings. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called the revelations serious and said he expects “other shoes will drop.” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a frequent Trump critic said he doubts Trump knew about Manafort’s relationship but he wants the issue fully investigated. U.S. diplomatic cables from 2006 describe Deripaska as one of two or three oligarchs Putin relies on. Manafort also is the focus of a broad investigation into stolen Ukrainian assets taken when Yanukovich was ousted in 2014.

News article:
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said Friday that former Trump campaign adviser Paul Manafort has volunteered to testify before his committee in its ongoing investigation of Russia's influence in last year's election. Manafort resigned from his position before Trump was elected, and Democrats have said his close ties to Russia raise national security issues. "We thank Mr. Manafort for volunteering, and encourage others with knowledge of these issues to voluntarily interview with the committee," Nunes said. Nunes added that the committee has asked FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers to testify behind closed doors about the committee's ongoing investigation. Nunes said they want this meeting to happen next Tuesday, and that he would postpone the original open hearing that was scheduled for that time. "We are asking Mr. Comey and Mr. Rogers to come back in. And until we can get them in in a closed session, it's not going to be worth it to have the open session," Nunes told reporters. However, the ranking Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff, was opposed to the idea of postponing the already scheduled meeting. "We strongly object to the cancellation of this hearing." Schiff said. "We would still urge the majority to reconsider." Nunes clarified that he was not seeking this private testimony based on the new documents he briefed the White House about on Wednesday, when he said he has seen evidence that some of Trump's transition team may have been inappropriately "unmasked" after "incidental" surveillance. He also said Manafort's name does not appear in any of those documents. Nunes said both he and Schiff have agreed to ask the FBI to brief the full committee about the ongoing counterintelligence investigation, which was previously restricted to only Nunes and Schiff. That comes after Democrats complained that only Nunes had access to some initial information that he publicized this week about surveillance of the Trump transition team. Although the previously scheduled open hearing is now delayed, Nunes said he believes that those who were set to testify still will be able to do so, such as former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates.

The South Korean ambassador to Egypt, who celebrated the 20th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries on Tuesday, said that Egypt is an attractive place for investment Egypt's President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi accepted an invitation on Tuesday by his South Korean counterpart Park Geun-hye to visit Seoul, Egypt's minister of environment said. During a speech delivered on behalf of the Egyptian president during South Korea's embassy celebration on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries, Khalid Fahmi said "El Sisi is keen on developing bilateral relations with the Asian state". El-Sisi voiced interest in the continuation and deepening of the existing cooperative relations of mutual trust between the two countries since the establishment of relations between the countries on 13 April 1995. South Korean Ambassador to Egypt, Chung Kwang-Kyun, hailed the "significant potential" to expand ties between Korea and Egypt. "Egypt is an attractive destination for foreign investment as proved at the Sharm El-Shiekh Economic Development Conference last month, because it has huge markets, a strong labour force and a strategic location, linking the GCC countries with North Africa and Europe" Chung Kwang-Kyun asserted that Egypt is a leading and key player in the Middle East and beyond. The Korean envoy reiterated that his country regards Egypt as an important partner and stands ready to expand cooperation in an all-inclusive way. The relationship between Korea and Egypt has made significant progress. In the political arena, President Park Geun-hye of Korea and El-Sisi held a summit in New York City in September 2014 – the first summit between the two countries in eight years. The high-level political exchange continued when the Prime Minister of Korea made an official visit to Egypt in November 2014. Economically, Korean companies have been active investors in Egypt. Samsung Electronics decided in 2013 to make investments in the Upper Egypt governorate of Beni Suef. Samsung's flat-screen TV factory in Beni Suef is now exporting approximately $500 million worth of merchandise a year, and employing about 2700 Egyptian workers. Search Keywords: Short link:

During a speech delivered on behalf of the Egyptian president during South Korea's embassy celebration on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries, Khalid Fahmi said "El Sisi is keen on developing bilateral relations with the Asian state". El-Sisi voiced interest in the continuation and deepening of the existing cooperative relations of mutual trust between the two countries since the establishment of relations between the countries on 13 April 1995. South Korean Ambassador to Egypt, Chung Kwang-Kyun, hailed the "significant potential" to expand ties between Korea and Egypt. "Egypt is an attractive destination for foreign investment as proved at the Sharm El-Shiekh Economic Development Conference last month, because it has huge markets, a strong labour force and a strategic location, linking the GCC countries with North Africa and Europe" Chung Kwang-Kyun asserted that Egypt is a leading and key player in the Middle East and beyond. The Korean envoy reiterated that his country regards Egypt as an important partner and stands ready to expand cooperation in an all-inclusive way. The relationship between Korea and Egypt has made significant progress. In the political arena, President Park Geun-hye of Korea and El-Sisi held a summit in New York City in September 2014 – the first summit between the two countries in eight years. The high-level political exchange continued when the Prime Minister of Korea made an official visit to Egypt in November 2014. Economically, Korean companies have been active investors in Egypt. Samsung Electronics decided in 2013 to make investments in the Upper Egypt governorate of Beni Suef. Samsung's flat-screen TV factory in Beni Suef is now exporting approximately $500 million worth of merchandise a year, and employing about 2700 Egyptian workers. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
(MENAFN- Emirates News Agency (WAM)) A high-profile Arab delegation recently went on a diplomatic mission to Amazonas, the largest state in Brazil, to explore trade and investment opportunities between Brazil and Arab countries, the Arab-Brazilian Chamber of Commerce (ABCC) has announced. The Governor of Amazonas, Jose Melo de Oliveira (Pros) hosted the delegation which comprised diplomats from 15 Arab countries and the League of Arab States. The Arab delegation also met Arthur Virgilio Neto, the Mayor of Manaus, the capital of Amazonas, during their visit. Among the highlights of the visit were a meeting with local businessmen from the Federation of Industries of the State of Amazonas (FIEAM) and a seminar on the investment and business options between Manaus and the Arab Nations that took place at the FIEAM's headquarters. Amazonas is a very resourceful state with unexplored wealth and offers the right opportunities for the Arab region to enhance their business ties with Brazil. Dr. Michel Alaby, Secretary General and CEO, Arab-Brazilian Chamber of Commerce, said, "The diplomatic mission from Arab countries to the Brazilian state of Amazonas was facilitated by the Arab-Brazilian Chamber of Commerce since we believe that such strategic visits are highly effective in building bridges and consolidating bilateral ties between the two regions. We are confident that after the success of the visit, the investment at various levels will continue to grow and seek new possibilities of trade between Brazil and the Arab region. Brazil remains an active business partner for the Arab nations with US$13.4 billion worth of exports to the region, comprising primarily food stuff and commodities and US$11.4 billion of imports last year of mainly oil and oil products and fertilisers." In 2014, Amazonas exported US$3.2 million worth of products to Arab countries while exports were at US$492,000 as of Q1 2015. Though exports mainly consisted of motorcycles, they also included radios and televisions, rectifiers, shaving blades, stamping press, and mobile telephony terminals. On the other hand, the Brazilian state imported US$17 million worth of products over the past year and US$ 7.8 million in Q1 2015. While Amazonas exported mainly to Egypt, the UAE and Morocco, it imported largely from the KSA, Qatar, Egypt, and the UAE.

President El-Sisi is scheduled to visit Germany next June Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry discussed preparations for President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi's visit to Germany with his German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier in a telephone call earlier on Wednesday, the Ahram Arabic news website reported. The two FMs also discussed bilateral relations, according Ahram Arabic. Earlier on Wednesday, a German government spokesperson announced that German Chancellor Angela Merkel would meet El-Sisi during his visit to Germany next month. On Tuesday, Germany's parliament speaker Norbert Lammert announced that he had written to the Egyptian ambassador in Berlin cancelling his meeting with El-Sisi due to "human rights abuses" in Egypt. On Wednesday afternoon, at a press conference with his Austrian counterpart Sebastian Kurz, Shoukry said that Egypt had never asked to meet the parliament speaker during El-Sisi's visit in the first place. Other countries should not interfere in Egypt's internal affairs, he added. The European Union slammed the Egyptian authorities this week, after an Egyptian court issued a preliminary death sentence against former Islamist president Mohamed Morsi on Saturday, and the country executed 6 Egyptians convicted of terrorism by a military tribunal on Sunday. Egypt's foreign ministry rejected the EU's claims, insisting that all Egyptians are guaranteed a fair trial. Search Keywords: Short link:

Egyptian president Abdel Fattah El-Sisi met Thursday afternoon with Austrian foreign minister Sebastian Kurz, who is currently on a multiple-day visit to the Egyptian capital to boost mutual ties, Egypt's presidency said. El-Sisi and Kurz discussed developments in the Middle East, mainly the rise of militant terrorism, presidential spokesman Alaa Youssef said. Both officials stressed on the religious and intellectual aspects that need to be taken into account when fighting terrorism in the region and Europe, the spokesman added. Kurz said that the Islamic State group, which has seized large swathes of land in Syria and Iraq and is currently boosting its presence in Libya, poses a serious threat to Europe by continuing to draw thousands of European fighters to its ranks. The senior diplomat expressed fears that foreign fighters who have joined jihadist groups would bring their militant views back home. Over 170 people are estimated to have left Austria to fight in the Middle East, some of whom have been killed, according to the interior ministry. Kurz, who arrived to Cairo on Wednesday, held earlier talks with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukri where they also discussed combating Islamic terrorism and the conflicts in Libya, Syria and Yemen, as well as the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. On Wednesday, an Austrian court sentenced two men, an Egyptian and an Austrian, on charges of joining a terrorist organisation after ruling they had travelled to Syria for training by radical jihadists, the Austrian Press Agency reported. Also on Wednesday, Kurz held talks with Ahmed Al-Tayeb, the Grand Imam of Egypt's top Islamic authority Al-Azhar, where they looked at different means of cooperation to combat militancy.

Beijing and Cairo have spoken of strengthening economic cooperation; New Zealand is about to head up the UN Security Council Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi will meet with Chinese State Councillor Yang Jiechi Monday in Cairo, Al-Ahram's Arabic news website reported, and will also hold a separate meeting with New Zealand's Foreign Minister Murray McCully. El-Sisi visited China in December where he met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. China's Minister of Commerce Gao Hucheng said at Egypt's Economic Development Conference in Sharm El-Sheikh in March that economic cooperation between Egypt and China has been increasing in the communications and energy sectors, among others, offering over 10,000 job opportunities. He also said that China also intends to cooperate further in Egypt through investments in the Suez Canal development as well as in the clean energy, culture and tourism sectors. Egypt was approved in April as a founding member of the Beijing-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. New Zealand will take up the presidency of the United Nations Security Council in July. McCully has said that the Middle East peace process will be high on the agenda in his meeting with El-Sisi, and is planning to meet with a number of Middle Eastern actors in June in preparation. "In 2016, New Zealand and Egypt will serve together on the Security Council. In Cairo discussions will focus on mutual security concerns like Syria, and ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant), as well as gaining an Egyptian perspective," on the Middle East peace process, he was reported as saying in a statement.

News article:
CAIRO (AP) — Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sissi travels to Berlin on Tuesday, where German leaders are ready to roll out the red carpet for the ex-general despite his government's abysmal human rights record. The trip, a first state visit long desired by the former army chief, will see him meet Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Joachim Gauck, who as an activist played a prominent role in ending repressive Communist rule in East Germany. Al-Sissi will also meet corporate leaders at a business conference Thursday. Al-Sissi's office said he seeks to boost economic, military and security cooperation, and highlighted 4.4 billion euros ($4.8 billion) in bilateral trade last year. Germany's Siemens AG has made the largest single commitment so far to Egypt under Al-Sissi's yearlong rule — a 10 billion euro agreement to build power plants. Human rights groups on Tuesday urged Merkel to link closer ties to Egypt addressing pervasive violations. "Germany should continue to freeze transfers of arms and security-related items that can be used for repression until Egypt investigates and brings to justice the security forces responsible for unlawful killings of hundreds of protesters," read a joint letter by five groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. But with much of the Middle East plunged into violent chaos in the years since the Arab Spring uprisings, Western nations have once again come to see many of the region's autocrats as partners for stability. "Merkel probably doesn't have a lot of sympathy for Al-Sissi, but she is enough into realpolitik to just go along and not stir up things too much," said Kristian Brakel, a Middle East expert at Germany's Council for Foreign Relations. "We have seen her deal with a lot of political leaders whom she actually harbors no sympathies at all, so I don't see how it would be different with al-Sissi." Al-Sissi, who overthrew his elected Islamist predecessor, Mohamed Morsi, following mass protests in 2013, has said Egypt must focus on stability and security in order to recover from years of turmoil unleashed by the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Since Morsi's ouster, the military-backed government has waged a sweeping crackdown on his supporters and jailed secular activists for taking part in unauthorized street protests. Those jailed include some of the leading secular and left-wing activists behind the 2011 uprising. Just this past Sunday, Egypt's state-sanctioned rights body criticized the practice of detaining suspects for extended periods pending the filing of formal charges and trial. It said that at least 2,600 people were killed in violence in the 18 months following Morsi's overthrow, nearly half of them his supporters. And only hours before al-Sissi's arrival, a court said it would give its final ruling next week on a death sentence recently handed to Morsi. In a statement issued from Istanbul, the Brotherhood accused the court of delaying the decision to avoid embarrassing al-Sissi abroad. Berlin police say some two dozen protests have been registered, but with fewer than 100 people at each, numbers far below the thousands of pro-Sissi demonstrators registered by Coptic Christian and other groups. A plane carrying over 140 al-Sissi supporters, including celebrities, departed early Tuesday for Berlin ahead of his visit. But human rights activist Mohammed Lotfy, who was due to speak before Germany's parliament, said he was banned from travelling at the airport and had his passport confiscated. "What is more concerning is that the regime is scared of even one person going out to speak critically. That is a sign of how frail the state is," Lotfy said. Al-Sissi makes no secret of his admiration for German efficiency and the country's economic prowess, and proudly announced Merkel's invitation at an investment conference in March. In an interview with Der Spiegel magazine earlier this year, he defended his government's actions by saying there is a "civilizational gap" between Germany and Egypt. "The police and people in Germany are civilized and have a sense of responsibility," he said. Germany has not quite returned the same level of affection. The head of parliament, Norbert Lammert, last month called off a planned meeting with al-Sissi, citing Egypt's "systematic persecution of opposition groups," as well as "mass arrests, convictions to lengthy prison terms and an incredible number of death sentences." Another point of contention is Germany's Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, a non-governmental organization linked to Merkel's political party. Egyptian security forces shut down its Cairo office and sentenced its German director to five years in prison, and Egyptian employees to two years, all in absentia. During a visit to Egypt in early April, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he hoped a solution could be found in the coming weeks, but no changes have been announced.

CAIRO (AP) — Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sissi travels to Berlin on Tuesday, where German leaders are ready to roll out the red carpet for the ex-general despite his government's abysmal human rights record. The trip, a first state visit long desired by the former army chief, will see him meet Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Joachim Gauck, who as an activist played a prominent role in ending repressive Communist rule in East Germany. Al-Sissi will also meet corporate leaders at a business conference Thursday. Al-Sissi's office said he seeks to boost economic, military and security cooperation, and highlighted 4.4 billion euros ($4.8 billion) in bilateral trade last year. Germany's Siemens AG has made the largest single commitment so far to Egypt under Al-Sissi's yearlong rule — a 10 billion euro agreement to build power plants. Human rights groups on Tuesday urged Merkel to link closer ties to Egypt addressing pervasive violations. "Germany should continue to freeze transfers of arms and security-related items that can be used for repression until Egypt investigates and brings to justice the security forces responsible for unlawful killings of hundreds of protesters," read a joint letter by five groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. But with much of the Middle East plunged into violent chaos in the years since the Arab Spring uprisings, Western nations have once again come to see many of the region's autocrats as partners for stability. "Merkel probably doesn't have a lot of sympathy for Al-Sissi, but she is enough into realpolitik to just go along and not stir up things too much," said Kristian Brakel, a Middle East expert at Germany's Council for Foreign Relations. "We have seen her deal with a lot of political leaders whom she actually harbors no sympathies at all, so I don't see how it would be different with al-Sissi." Al-Sissi, who overthrew his elected Islamist predecessor, Mohamed Morsi, following mass protests in 2013, has said Egypt must focus on stability and security in order to recover from years of turmoil unleashed by the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Since Morsi's ouster, the military-backed government has waged a sweeping crackdown on his supporters and jailed secular activists for taking part in unauthorized street protests. Those jailed include some of the leading secular and left-wing activists behind the 2011 uprising. Just this past Sunday, Egypt's state-sanctioned rights body criticized the practice of detaining suspects for extended periods pending the filing of formal charges and trial. It said that at least 2,600 people were killed in violence in the 18 months following Morsi's overthrow, nearly half of them his supporters. And only hours before al-Sissi's arrival, a court said it would give its final ruling next week on a death sentence recently handed to Morsi. In a statement issued from Istanbul, the Brotherhood accused the court of delaying the decision to avoid embarrassing al-Sissi abroad. Berlin police say some two dozen protests have been registered, but with fewer than 100 people at each, numbers far below the thousands of pro-Sissi demonstrators registered by Coptic Christian and other groups. A plane carrying over 140 al-Sissi supporters, including celebrities, departed early Tuesday for Berlin ahead of his visit. But human rights activist Mohammed Lotfy, who was due to speak before Germany's parliament, said he was banned from travelling at the airport and had his passport confiscated. "What is more concerning is that the regime is scared of even one person going out to speak critically. That is a sign of how frail the state is," Lotfy said. Al-Sissi makes no secret of his admiration for German efficiency and the country's economic prowess, and proudly announced Merkel's invitation at an investment conference in March. In an interview with Der Spiegel magazine earlier this year, he defended his government's actions by saying there is a "civilizational gap" between Germany and Egypt. "The police and people in Germany are civilized and have a sense of responsibility," he said. Germany has not quite returned the same level of affection. The head of parliament, Norbert Lammert, last month called off a planned meeting with al-Sissi, citing Egypt's "systematic persecution of opposition groups," as well as "mass arrests, convictions to lengthy prison terms and an incredible number of death sentences." Another point of contention is Germany's Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, a non-governmental organization linked to Merkel's political party. Egyptian security forces shut down its Cairo office and sentenced its German director to five years in prison, and Egyptian employees to two years, all in absentia. During a visit to Egypt in early April, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he hoped a solution could be found in the coming weeks, but no changes have been announced.

News article:
(MENAFN- Daily News Egypt) Egypt and Switzerland's trade balance stood at CHF 1bn in 2014, according to Markus Leitner, Switzerland's ambassador to Egypt. Of this amount, 90% of exports come from the Swiss side, with only 10% from the Egyptian side, Leitner added. "There is obviously a huge gap, and we need to fix that to enable Egyptian exporters to take advantage of the framework agreements and the free trade agreement between Egypt and Switzerland. There's work to be done, we're aware of that and we're working on this issue," Leitner told Daily News Egypt. Egypt's exports to Switzerland include the very basic agricultural and textile products. Swiss exports, on the other hand, include machinery and pharmaceuticals that come in bulk, amongst others. Leitner indicated that in terms of development cooperation, the Swiss side has invested approximately CHF 25m in three pillars: democratic transition; economic development; as well as migration and protection. Most of the aforementioned amount went into economic development projects, he said. We have long-term projects here in Egypt, and among the projects we have participated in are the upgrading of radiology centres and the development of blood banks, amongst others, Leitner noted. Since 2011, the Swiss have increased their cooperation with Egypt in the area of water sanitation and irrigation, he specified. "Migration is also an important topic, as this is the biggest industry that Egypt has, and no other industry provides more foreign exchange than the Egyptian migrants abroad. We help them get protected and get their rights, and help channel their money back into Egypt. We further help them to invest here in Egypt," said the ambassador. Leitner also discussed a programme launched by the Swiss embassy in late November 2014 in Aswan. The programme aims to provide employment opportunities for youths outside of the tourism sector, and encourage entrepreneurial projects in the area. There are projects that the Swiss embassy is currently studying, although funding for specific projects has yet to be made. The embassy has allocated some CHF 5m for the programme in collaboration with Care organisation, a leading humanitarian company fighting global poverty, Leitner said. "Among the projects we're looking at now are in the fisheries sector, where we see good potential," Leitner said. He added that they are looking to support national ideas in the agricultural and basic industrial sectors. Through the Aswan programme, the embassy aims to help young entrepreneurs develop their business ideas, help them grow, and provide help to existing entrepreneurs to make them viable. It is a long term project covering the whole production chain, starting from the idea and carrying on through to the funding. It also targets helping young entrepreneurs in expanding their businesses and sell their products domestically and abroad. Leitner indicated that they chose Aswan in particular because there is not so much international focus in this area.

Volker Kauder said Egypt's role in the region is critical Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi met the leader of the ruling Christian Democratic Union party in the German Bundestag on Thursday, state news agency MENA reported. El-Sisi, who is on a two-day visit to Germany, met with Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday, along with other officials, and signed several business deals. Head of the CDU Volker Kauder described his meeting with El-Sisi as “positive”, according to MENA. He said they discussed “necessary” economic developments in Egypt in addition to the migration crisis that has seen waves of migrants arriving in Europe via the Mediterranean. Kauder said that Egypt's role is "pivotal" for installing stability in the region, MENA reported. The Egyptian military announced in May that border control forces had arrested over six thousand people attempting to illegally enter or leave Egypt. It did not specify at which borders the migrants were arrested, but people smugglers are known to operate along the Egyptian coastline. Hundreds of migrants have been killed in boat accidents in recent months, and the EU plans to take action against the smugglers. El-Sisi’s visit caused controversy in Germany after Norbert Lammert, the president of the German parliament and a CDU politician, refused a scheduled meeting with El-Sisi citing concerns about "a lack of democratic progress." During a Wednesday press conference, Merkel also voiced criticism of recent mass death sentences handed to Islamists convicted of a variety of criminal offences in Egypt. However, Merkel stressed Germany’s comprehensive support for Egypt in the latter’s war against terror. In the future, she said, Germany's support would increase, militarily and financially. El-Sisi also signed on Wednesday an 8 billion euro (approx. $9 billion) deal between German industrial group Siemens and Egypt to supply gas and wind power plants designed to boost Egypt's power generation by 50 percent.

Egyptian trade and industry minister believes Sunday's deal could open the way to an all-Africa free trade zone in the near future Africa's three major regional economic committees (RECs) are set to finalise an agreement on forming the continent's largest free trade area (FTA) during a tripartite summit taking place 7-10 June in Egypt's Sharm El-Sheikh. The tripartite grouping, which accounts for 51 percent of Africa's $2.3 trillion GDP, will sign a deal Wednesday to create free trade zones for goods immediately, with the hope of introducing services and intra-continent investor opportunities at a later stage. Intra-trade within the tripartite area increased threefold to $102.6 billion in the 10 years leading to 2014. The deal would bring together the 26 countries that are members of the three RECs, COMESA-EAC-SADC, giving Egypt free trade access to seven new African nations. The tripartite grouping includes African nations such as South Africa, Rwanda, Zambia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Egypt and Zimbabwe. "The agreement will bolster Egypt's status internationally and stragically," Ministry of Industry and Foreign Trade Mounir Fakhry Abdel-Nour told the state-run Al-Ahram daily Saturday. Egypt expects to see its exports to African countries rise by 100 percent in three years to $5 billion compared to $2.7 billion in 2013, a growth rate of 33 percent annually. Abdel-Nour added that Egypt has agreed with the African Development Bank to provide credit facilities worth $500 million to Egyptian exporters to support Cairo's trade deals with Africa, The industrial aspect of the agreement would also allow Egyptian businesses to invest in these countries, with many African nations in need of comprehensive industrial development, Fakhry added. The Egyptian goods expected to feature in the country's exports to African markets as a result of this agreement include engineering products, textiles, chemicals. furniture, and agricultural produce. The anticipated Sharm treaty is the culmination of four years of negotiations among member states of the tripartite, which ended in a tentative consensual agreement reached in Burundi in October 2014. Fakhry believes that the Sharm deal could be a first step towards forming an all-Africa free trade area by 2017, which is currently under negotiation. Thirteen heads of African states and other African delegates are expected to sign the deal in Sharm El-Sheikh Sunday. Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi is expected to attend the summit, as well as Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe. The summit will also be attended by heads of international organisations such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and World Bank. Search Keywords: Short link:

(MENAFN- Daily News Egypt) Suez Canal Authority Chairman Mohab Mamish revealed on Sunday the international coalition that will promote the opening of the new Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with two French companies as well as two companies from Egypt and the US, for the planned opening. The names of the companies are yet to be revealed. During a press conference held on Sunday morning, the promotional campaign, as well as the international coalition, was revealed. Mamish said that, to receive funds from investors, businessmen, and citizens to cover the opening's cost and not to waste the state budget, discussions with Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb and the Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), Hisham Ramez, are in progress. The discussions will focus on opening bank accounts under the name of "Farha Misr". Mamish added that meetings with the international coalitions were held and they are willing to share the opening's cost with a percentage of the dredging contract.

News article:
A police probe into the deadly shooting last month of a Bedouin man as his car struck and killed a policeman in the unrecognized Bedouin village of Umm al-Hiran revealed a breakdown in operational procedures in the lead-up to the operation. Police were still gathering testimony as part of the probe into the incident, which authorities first claimed as a ramming terror attack — a charge the family of the suspect, Yaqoub Mousa Abu Al-Qia’an, has vehemently denied, arguing that he was shot before his car sped up, leading him to lose control of the vehicle. Channel 10 reported Thursday that new testimony showed a troubling picture of police preparedness for the January 18 operation, which aimed to evacuate the village and demolish its homes. The report said planning for the predawn operation commenced just the previous afternoon, despite the fact that such operations generally require weeks of planning. The plan was initially rejected when submitted that evening for approval, on the grounds that the officers dispatched to carry it out were not sufficiently prepared, the report said. The plan was also leaked, and yet it went ahead anyway. Furthermore, a short briefing was held that morning at the village for senior officers only. The policemen dispatched to secure the demolition were unfamiliar with the layout, and were tense when they arrived because a vehicle had blocked the turnoff to the village, forcing them to abandon their vehicles and run on foot for several kilometers in the dark. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Previous testimony leaked this week suggested that Al-Qia’an was shot both before and after his car hit the officer, contributing to claims that the incident wasn’t a terror attack. A Justice Ministry investigation has found that the January incident was not terrorism, reports this week said. The incident took place in the early morning of January 18, when police arrived to demolish houses in the village, which the state was seeking to remove in order to clear the way for a new Jewish town. As officers converged on Umm al-Hiran, Abu Al-Qia’an, 47, a teacher and father of 12, packed a few belongings into his SUV and drove from his house, telling friends that he did not wish to witness its destruction. Soon afterward, the vehicle rammed into a group of officers, killing 1st Sgt. Erez Levi, 34. Abu Al-Qia’an was fatally shot by police. Advertisement Video footage that emerged in the hours after the incident showed that the officers fired before Abu Al-Qia’an accelerated, and that, contrary to police assertions, the car’s lights were on. In addition, Channel 10 reported last month that a police autopsy indicated that a police bullet hit him in the right knee, smashing it. The bullet wound may have caused Abu Al-Qia’an to lose control of his car, the TV report said. Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan (Likud), who, along with Israel Police Chief Roni Alsheich, initially asserted that Al-Qia’an was a nationalistically motivated terrorist, inspired by the Islamic State group, has since backtracked on the claim. The minister said on Thursday that he would apologize to the family if the Justice Ministry findings were conclusive. Erdan said in a statement that it was “possible” he was mistaken. The final report by the ministry’s Police Internal Investigations Department has not yet been released and officials say it’s still being worked on. Earlier this week, testimony collected from a number of officers at the scene suggested they may have shot Al-Qia’an before it was clear if he was trying to hit the police, Channel 10 news reported Wednesday. Raoul Wootliff contributed to this report.

Palestinian medical sources have reported that a young Palestinian man was killed, earlier at dawn Tuesday, after falling into a deep quarry when Israeli soldiers chased him, and others workers, while trying to enter Israel for work, without permits. The sources stated the Palestinian, Rabea’ Najeh Salman, 20, is from Askar refugee camp, in the northern West Bank district of Nablus. Eyewitnesses said the soldiers chased many Palestinian workers, west of Salfit, in central West Bank, especially as they climbed the Annexation Wall, near the Zawiya village, west of the city. The Palestinian then fell into a Stone Masonry quarry, that was approximately 50 meters high. Palestinian medics rushed to the scene after receiving a call about the incident, but the young man died from the fall, and was officially pronounced dead before the ambulance even reached Rafidia governmental hospital, in Nablus.

A colonialist Israeli settler shot and killed, Wednesday, a young Palestinian man, allegedly after he attacked him with a knife and stabbed him, in Teneh Omarim illegal colony, built on private Palestinian land, south of Hebron, in the southern part of the occupied West Bank. The Israeli army said its soldiers rushed to the scene and initiated an investigation into the incident. The Palestinian was later identified as Sa’adi Mahmoud Ali Qaisiyya, 25, from ath-Thaheriyya town, south of Hebron. Several Israeli ambulances were seen rushing to the colony, amidst extensive deployment of soldiers, and many armed colonists, while a military helicopter flew overhead. Israeli sources said the settler was attacked and mildly injured in his home, before “he drew his weapon and shot the Palestinian.” The sources added that the wounded Israeli, 33 years of age, suffered mild injuries to his limbs, and received treatment by Israeli medics. Israeli Ynet News said the incident took place in “Mor Farm” outpost, near Taneh Omarim settlement. It added that the Palestinian entered the farm before the settler heard noises outside his property, and reportedly “saw a man carrying two knives, then the settler ran towards his home to grab his weapon, while the Palestinian chased him, and stabbed him in front of his family.” It added that the wounded settler then managed to shoot and kill the young Palestinian man. Eyewitnesses told WAFA News Agency that the Palestinian bled to death without receiving medical treatment.

News article:
An Israeli settler has shot dead a Palestinian over an alleged stabbing attack in yet another instance of using lethal force against Palestinians in the occupied territories. An Israeli army spokeswoman said Wednesday’s incident took place in the Teneh Omarim settlement in the southern West Bank, near the Palestinian city of al-Khalil (Hebron). She further claimed that the Palestinian “armed with a knife” broke into an Israeli settler’s home and stabbed him, adding that the settler, who had suffered light wounds, shot and killed the assailant. The Palestinian Health Ministry identified the victim as 24-year-old Saad Qisiah from the nearby city of Dhahiriyah. Over the past months, Israeli settlers and the Tel Aviv regime forces have fatally shot many Palestinians, claiming that they sought to carry out attacks against Israelis. Leading Israeli officials have come under fire for supporting the shoot-to-kill policy against Palestinians suspects. Read more: Israel has handed down lenient sentences to those charged with extrajudicial killing of the Palestinians. Palestinians take part in a protest following the sentencing of Israeli soldier Elor Azaria, in the West Bank city of al-Khalil (Hebron), February 21, 2017. (Photo by Reuters) The latest example of such sentences is the case of Israeli Sergeant Elor Azaria, who has been given an 18-month jail term after being convicted of manslaughter for shooting dead a severely-wounded Palestinian following an alleged stabbing attack in al-Khalil in March 2016. Azaria was caught on camera cocking his rifle and fatally shooting Abed al-Fatah al-Sharif in the head from just several meters away while the victim was still alive. In another development on Wednesday, Azaria appealed against his manslaughter conviction and jail term. Three of his lawyers announced that they were quitting from the case, arguing that options other than an appeal should be pursued. Tensions have rocked the occupied Palestinian territories since August 2015, when Israel imposed restrictions on the entry of Palestinian worshipers into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in East Jerusalem al-Quds. Some 280 Palestinians have lost their lives at the hands of Israeli forces in the tensions since the beginning of October that year.

A Palestinian was killed in an exchange of fire with Israeli troops in the West Bank city of Ramallah, the Israeli army said Monday. The man, whom Israeli police named as 31-year-old Bassel al-Aaraj, opened fire at soldiers who came to arrest him at his home Sunday night and was shot dead. Two other Palestinians were wounded by gunfire in subsequent clashes with Israeli troops, Palestinian hospital sources said. Two weapons were later found on the property, according to an army spokeswoman. A police spokeswoman said al-Aaraj was "the head of a cell planning attacks against Israeli targets". Since a wave of violence broke out in October 2015, 254 Palestinians, 40 Israelis, two Americans, one Jordanian, one Eritrean and one Sudanese have been killed, according to an AFP count. Most of the Palestinians who lost their lives were carrying out knife, gun or car-ramming attacks, according to Israeli authorities, with others killed during protests, in clashes or during air raids on Gaza. The Israeli army routinely carries out forays and arrests in Ramallah even though it is in principle entirely under the control of the Palestinian Authority.

JERUSALEM (JTA) — A Palestinian man who allegedly was part of a terror cell planning attack on Israeli targets was killed in a gunfight with Israeli troops in the West Bank. Basel al-A’araj was killed overnight Monday during an IDF arrest raid in Ramallah in the northern West Bank. Al-A’araj, 31, was shot and killed by Israeli troops after they surrounded the house where he was holed up in order to arrest him. He opened fire on the troops, according to the IDF. Al-A’araj was alleged to be part of a terrorist cell planning to carry out attacks on Israeli targets and allegedly was responsible for procuring weapons. An M-16 rifle and an improvised Carlo-style submachine gun were found inside the home, the IDF said. Al-Araj was detained without charges or explanation by Palestinian security forces in April last year, the Palestinian Maan news agency reported. He was released in September after mounting a hunger strike in prison amid reports of torture and mistreatment. On Sunday, two Palestinian men from Nablus were arrested at the Tapuah Junction in the northern West Bank on suspicion that they were planning to carry out a stabbing attack there. One of the men was carrying a large knife.

A young Palestinian man has been killed as clashes broke out between Israeli forces and Palestinian youths in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah. The Israeli forces stormed the Qaddura Refugee Camp in central Ramallah in the early hours of Monday and fired tear gas and live ammunition at youths there, al-Aqsa satellite television said. The TV channel quoted Palestinian sources as saying that the victim was shot dead by Israeli forces at his home in Ramallah. Photos of the young man’s house were also released, showing traces of blood. Israeli media, however, alleged that soldiers killed the Palestinian man after he opened fire on them. According to al-Aqsa, two young Palestinian men were injured when Israeli soldiers fired live ammunition while several others suffered symptoms of tear gas inhalation. Tensions have rocked the occupied Palestinian territories since August 2015, when Israel imposed restrictions on the entry of Palestinian worshipers into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in East Jerusalem al-Quds. Around 285 Palestinians have lost their lives at the hands of Israeli forces since the beginning of October that year, when tensions escalated.

News article:
Two IDF Border policemen were wounded in a stabbing attack Monday morning by the Lions’ Gate in the Old City of Jerusalem, by an Arab from a neighborhood that has been the source of some of the deadliest attacks in Israel. The attack took place around 4:00 am, when the terrorist, armed with a large knife, entered the guard booth where the two policemen were stationed. The Palestinian terrorist stabbed the policemen, who were limited in their response by the cramped quarters. One of the IDF soldiers managed to exit the booth, load his weapon, and shoot the terrorist. One of the IDF soldiers suffered serious wounds while the other suffered moderate wounds. The terrorist was taken to the hospital where he died of his wounds. Security was on high alert and extra troops deployed in the city for the holiday of Purim. Celebrated on Sunday in most of the rest of the country, “Shushan Purim” is celebrated one day later in cities that were surrounded by walls at the time that Joshua first led the Jews into Israel after the Exodus from Egypt, an estimated 3,500 years ago. The terrorist was identified by Arabic media as Ibrahim Mahmoud Mattara, a 25-year-old resident of East Jerusalem’s Jabel Mukaber neighborhood. Several terrorists have come from this Arab suburb of Jerusalem, including the terrorist who killed four soldiers and injured 15 in a ramming attack in January. Hamas has a strong following in this section of Jerusalem, and a Hamas flag was found in Mattara’s home after the attack. In November 2014, two Arabs from the village gruesome stabbing-axe attack in the Har Nof Synagogue in November 2014, killing seven Jews while they were praying, and a Druze policeman, who was the first on the scene. Another resident of the village carried out a shooting attack almost exactly 9 years ago in Mercaz Harav Yeshiva, killing 8 students. Two Arabs from the village carried out a shooting-stabbing attack on an Israeli bus in October 2015, killing three Israelis. Israel conquered the town as part of East Jerusalem in 1967. When it was annexed in 1980, the Israeli government offered citizenship to the residents, many of whom rejected the offer, and remained as permanent residents. As holders of ‘blue’ identity cards identical to thse of Jewish citizens, they have wide freedom of movement within Israel, and access to health care, unemployment and other benefits.

News article:
Israeli police shot and killed a 25-year-old Palestinian near the Lion's Gate entrance to Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem's Old City early this morning after he allegedly stabbed two Israeli police officers, who were lightly and moderately injured. The man was identified as Ibrahim Mahmoud Matar, a resident of the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Jabal Al-Mukaber, located south of the Old City. The shooting happened ahead of the Muslim dawn prayers, as worshipers were headed to Al-Aqsa Mosque. Police 'controlling the situation' Witnesses told Ma'an they witnessed a dispute inside an Israeli police post located near Lion's Gate between an Israeli policeman and a Palestinian "who was carrying a stick". Israeli police then forced the young man outside of the enclosure and "executed" him at point blank range with four bullets, leading to his immediate death, witnesses said. Referring to the dispute that led to the shooting, eyewitnesses told Ma'an that Israeli police were "controlling the situation" and could have easily detained Matar without using lethal force. However, a statement released by Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Al-Samri alleged that Matar entered the police post with a knife and stabbed two Israeli police officers before a third shot and killed him immediately. According to Al-Samri, Matar had arrived to the area in his car, which he parked near Lion's Gate. Israeli border police stopped him as he tried to walk through Lion's Gate and led him into the police room to search him, when he "attacked" two Israeli border police officers that were inside. A third officer was able to leave the room, and then shot and killed Matar, the police statement said. Al-Samri said the first officer sustained moderate injuries, while the second was slightly injured. They were both taken to a hospital for medical treatment. Lockdown Following the killing, there was a heavy deployment of Israeli forces in and around Lion's Gate and many Palestinians were prevented from reaching Al-Aqsa Mosque to pray, with witnesses saying the lockdown lasted from 04:30 until 06:00. Later Monday morning, Israeli forces raided Matar's home in Jabal Al-Mukaber and detained his brother, parents and his uncle, according to locals and Israeli police. Following the raid, Israeli police spokesperson Micky Rosenfeld said in a written statement that Israeli police were carrying out "general security measures" in public areas across Jerusalem as celebrations for the Jewish holiday of Purim were scheduled throughout the day, and that investigations into the shooting were ongoing.

Israeli soldiers killed, Monday, a young Palestinian man in the Asbat Gate area, in Jerusalem’s Old City, after he reportedly “stabbed two border police officers.” The Israeli army alleged that the young man, later identified as Ibrahim Mahmoud Matar, 25, “attacked and stabbed two soldiers before they shot him.” Following the fatal shooting, the soldiers closed the entire area, while more units were deployed in the neighborhoods and alleys of the Old City. Later, the soldiers invaded Jabal al-Mokabber neighborhood, southeast of Jerusalem, to break into the home of the slain Palestinian, in Eshqeirat area, and clashed with dozens of youngsters, who hurled stones on them, while the army fired gas bombs and concussion grenades. Israeli daily, Haaretz, said the two injured officers suffered moderate wounds, and quoted the police stating that the Palestinian exited his car and “went into a post where the officers were stationed, and stabbed them.” It added that the police struggled with the Palestinian, “before one of the two officers managed to overtake him, and shot him.” Following the fatal shooting, the soldiers invaded the family homes of the slain Palestinian, and abducted his parents, and his uncle.

A Palestinian teenager allegedly attempted to ram her car into a bus stop at the Etzion Junction in the central West Bank on Wednesday, prompting Israeli security forces to shoot and wound her, the army said. No Israelis were seriously injured in the incident, though a 28-year-old Israeli woman in “advanced stages of pregnancy” was taken to the hospital after experiencing a panic attack, according to the Magen David Adom ambulance service. The 16-year-old Palestinian driver was critically injured from the crash and IDF gunfire, according to Arab media. She received medical treatment from the Israel Defense Forces and was taken to the hospital, MDA said. She was identified by Arabic media as Fatemah Taqatqa from Beit Fajjar, a Palestinian town south of Bethlehem. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The incident occurred shortly before 4:00 p.m. Surveillance footage from the scene, first posted on social media and later released by the IDF, showed the car veer across multiple lands of traffic and crash into the metal bollards surrounding the bus stop. Advertisement According to the military, the teenager specifically targeted the troops stationed at the junction, but both soldiers and civilians could be seen standing at the bus stop. Local Bethlehem media reported that the driver’s cousin, Amjad Taqatqa, was arrested shortly after the attack. The IDF could not immediately confirm the report. The Etzion Junction’s bus stop and hitchhiking post has been the scene of a number of terror attacks in late 2015 and early 2016, including both car-rammings and shootings. The busy junction sits at a major crossroads in the Etzion settlement bloc between Jerusalem and Hebron. The vehicular attacks forced the government to install metal poles around the junction’s bus stop in order to prevent attacks, which have waned over the past year. Though a marked drop has been recorded by security officials in recent months, 40 Israelis, two Americans, a Palestinian and an Eritrean national have been killed in the spate of stabbing, car-ramming and shooting attacks that began a year and a half ago. Advertisement According to AFP figures, some 250 Palestinians, a Jordanian and a Sudanese migrant have also been killed, most of them in the course of carrying out attacks, Israel says, and many of the others in clashes with troops in the West Bank and at the Gaza border, as well as in Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip in response to rocket attacks. The spate of Palestinian attacks that began in October 2015 was dubbed the “lone wolf” intifada, as many of the attacks were carried out by individuals who were not connected to any terror group. The attacks were at first attributed to tensions over Palestinian fears that Israel was seeking to change the status quo on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, a charge Israel has repeatedly and vehemently denied. Palestinian leaders have argued that the primary cause for attacks during this period was despair caused by Israel’s military occupation of the West Bank. The Hamas terror group, which controls the Gaza Strip, continues to refer to each attack as a part of a “Jerusalem Intifada.”

News article:
A murder suspect killed a Palestinian policeman on Monday in a shootout at a refugee camp in the West Bank, the official Wafa news agency reported. The shooting broke out in the densely populated Palestinian refugee camp of Balata, in the Israeli-occupied city of Nablus, when police went to arrest suspects, Wafa said, quoting officials. Police spokesman Adnan al-Damiri identified the policeman who died as Hassan Ali al-Hajj and said he was shot dead by Ahmed Abu Hamada, also known as "Zaabur". Abu Hamada, who was wounded in the gunfight, was wanted by for murder, the possession of weapons and trafficking, as well as opening fire on police, said Damiri. Police had gone to arrest him and other wanted criminals, but he refused to surrender and began shooting at the security forces. The governor of Nablus told Wafa that a second policeman was slightly wounded in the shootout. The suspect was eventually arrested, said Wafa. Balata -- the largest Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank home to 30,000 people -- saw an uptick of violence last year when Palestinian security forces launched raids to seize illegal weapons. There are frequent clashes between police and armed men who are holed up in the camp. One of the men, Hatem Abu Rizeq, 30, recently told AFP he does not "trust Palestinian security forces" and those like him tracked by the authorities are constantly in fear of being "executed". Some analysts say Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas regards the camp as a support base for his political rival Mohammed Dahlan, who lives in exile.

London – A woman has been pulled from the River Thames alive after Wednesday’s attack on a bridge near Britain’s parliament in Westminster, the Port of London Authority (PLA) said, adding that she was being treated for serious injuries. “A female member of the public was pulled from the water near Westminster Bridge, alive, with serious injuries,” a PLA spokesman told Reuters. “She’s undergoing very urgent medical treatment now.” He added that the river had been closed to all non-emergency traffic in the immediate area. Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May will chair a meeting of the government emergency committee to discuss the response to the terror incident in London. The emergency committee known as Cobra coordinates the high-level response to serious incidents. It brings together government ministers with senior officials of the emergency services and security and intelligence agencies. Such meetings are held after serious incidents such at the July 7, 2005, attack on London transport services. The Wednesday meeting is held in the briefing room of the Cabinet Office on Whitehall.

By Reuters March 29, 2017 Israeli paramilitary police officers shot and killed a Palestinian woman who tried to attack them with a pair of scissors outside Jerusalem’s walled Old City on Wednesday, police spokesmen said. The incident occurred at Damascus Gate, a heavily guarded entrance to the Old City and the scene of similar violence in the past. “Police responded to a life-threatening situation and the female terrorist was shot dead at the scene,” police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Luba Samri, a police spokeswoman, said the 49-year-old woman had “approached a group of officers, pulled out a knife and tried to stab them.” She said the woman was a resident of East Jerusalem, which Israel captured along with the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. At least 241 Palestinians have been killed in Israel and the Palestinian Territories in a period of sporadic violence that began in October 2015 but has tapered off in recent months. Two American tourists and 37 Israelis have been killed in such incidents since the violence began.

News article:
Israeli security forces carry away a body, reportedly of a Palestinian who was shot after an attempted stabbing attack, at the entrance to Jerusalem's Old City on March 29, 2017 A Palestinian woman said to be the mother of a man killed last year attempted to stab Israeli police with scissors at the entrance to Jerusalem's Old City Wednesday before being shot dead, officials said. The woman pulled the scissors on the security force members at the entrance to Damascus Gate but was shot dead before she was able to stab anyone, a police spokeswoman said in a statement. A police image showed the woman with the scissors in the air seeking to stab the police. Photos posted on social media showed the middle-aged woman lying face down after the attack outside the gate, a main entrance to the Old City. A number of other entrances to the Old City, a key tourist attraction, were also briefly sealed off. The incident came ahead of the week-long Passover Jewish holiday beginning April 10, during which security in Jerusalem is often increased. The Palestinian health ministry identified the dead woman as Siham Nimr, 49, from the Shuafat refugee camp in east Jerusalem. The Palestinian official news agency said Nimr was the mother of Mustafa Nimr, a 27-year-old shot dead by Israeli police in September. Police initially claimed he was an attacker, but later admitted that was untrue and that he and his cousin Ali had merely tried to evade a police spot check near Shuafat while driving. Ali was later charged with manslaughter, with prosecutors saying his erratic driving made officers shoot. A wave of violence that broke out in October 2015 has claimed the lives of 258 Palestinians, 40 Israelis, two Americans, one Jordanian, an Eritrean and a Sudanese national, according to an AFP count. Most of the Palestinians killed were carrying out knife, gun or car-ramming attacks, according to Israeli authorities. Others died during protests, clashes or in Israeli air raids on the Gaza Strip. Violence has subsided in recent months, despite sporadic attacks. Human rights groups have accused Israeli security forces of using excessive force to subdue attackers in certain cases, most of which have been carried out by lone-wolf assailants, many of them young. Reviews by the army of two fatal shootings of attackers in October found that the use of deadly force could have been avoided.

News article:
A Palestinian woman from the village of al-Rama in northern Israel's Upper Galilee was shot dead on Monday, according to Israeli police, Maan News reported. Israeli police spokeswoman Luba al-Samri said in a statement that gunshots were fired at 35-year-old Lina Ahmad's car while she was driving, killing her immediately. She added that police detectives were investigating the shooting. Palestinian-majority areas in Israel have seen an increase in gun violence in recent years, while members of the Arab Joint List of Israel's parliament, the Knesset, have called on authorities to crack down on illegal weapons in Israel's Palestinian communities, where there is a disproportionate lack of policing compared to Jewish-majority neighborhoods. Read: 3 Israelis arrested over stabbing, seriously wounding 19-year-old Palestinian MK Yousif Jabarin of the Joint List warned against a rise in policing of Palestinian communities in the form of punitive action such as housing demolitions, rather than protecting Palestinian citizens of Israel from criminal violence. "This is an issue that desperately requires reform rather than punishment," Jabarin told Ma'an in April 2016. It is important that the police adopt a new policy and attitude towards the Arab community. […] Without this, the mere establishment of additional police stations and an increase in policing may result in increased tension and confrontation between our community and the police, rather than effective policing of crime and violence. In a Knesset meeting in January, Joint List MK Usama Saadi called illegal firearms "a cancer in the body of Arab society" – using the Israeli term to refer to Palestinian citizens of Israel. "We have constantly warned about this, but there is an outcry only when the weapons are directed — once — at Tel Aviv," referring to a shooting carried out by a Palestinian citizen of Israel in Tel Aviv in January 2016 that killed two Israelis and injured seven.

News article:
West Bank – An IDF soldier was killed and another lightly wounded when a Palestinian driver drove into a crowded bus stop outside the town of Ofra, north of Jerusalem, Thursday morning. The attacker, identified by Palestinian media as 21-year-old Malek Ahmed Mousa Hamed, was neutralized and lightly wounded, and taken into custody by IDF forces at the scene. The wounded soldier was evacuated to Hadassah University Medical Center at Mount Scopus. Elhai Teharlev, a resident of Talmon, in the Binyamin region of Samaria, will be laid to rest this evening at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem. The incident occurred shortly after 10:00 in the morning, when Hamed plowed his car into a crowded bus stop along Route 60. In the aftermath of the attack, Magen David Adom paramedic Ilan Klein told TPS, “this was a very bad incident. [When I arrived, I found] a young man, about 20 years old, lying unconscious on the ground, with no pulse and badly wounded. We tried to recussitate him but were had no choice but to declare him dead. “Nearby, another man, also about 20 years old, was lying nearby, wounded in the legs but conscious. Together with IDF medics, we administered first aid and evacuated him to Jerusalem,” Klein said. Another first responder, United Hatzalah EMT Nachum Bienenfeld added that emergency teams found the Palestinian vehicle overturned in a ditch near the bus stop. “The Palestinian vehicle had come up on the sidewalk, and rammed into a group of soldiers who were standing near the bus stop,” Bienenfeld said. “The vehicle had continued and landed in a ditch by the side of the road. Security poles that had been set up near the bus stop due to a previous ramming attack that had taken place at that bus stop prevented injury to other civilians who were standing at the bus stop.” Hamas praised the attack, calling it a “response to Israel’s crimes against the Palestinian people and a direct continuation of its heroism in the al-Quds Intifada.” The organization was using a common term to refer to the escalation in violence that began in October 2015. {NewsPhotosEmbed 793290014}

Credit: IDF Spokesperson Unit According to an initial assessment, the driver of a car with Palestinian license plates ploughed into two Israeli soldiers, killing the first young man, Golani Brigade sergeant Elichai Taharlev, 20, and injuring the second, 19. They were standing behind concrete slabs by a hitchhiking spot, located at the junction outside of the settlement of Ofra. Taharlev, who was promoted posthumously to the rank of sergeant was buried Thursday evening at Mt. Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem. The suspected assailant - identified by Palestinians as Malik Ahmed Hamed, 21, from the village of Silwad north of Ramallah - was arrested by Israeli army forces at the scene. Israeli forces entered Hamed's home in Silwad to question his family. Investigators said that Hamed planned the attack. Security officials added they spoke to his family, which said he was motivated politically to carry out the attack. Hamed had spent four months in an Israeli prison ago after he was caught climbing the fence of the settlement Adam in 2015. A volunteer at the emergency medical service United Hatzalah who had treated the victims, Nachum Bienenfeld, said a Palestinian drove his vehicle into a group of soldiers standing near the bus stop. According to Bienenfeld, security poles that were installed after a previous car-ramming attack prevented other civilians who were standing at the bus stop from being injured.

Credit: Emergency Medical Service (EMS) The 19-year-old victim was evacuated to Hadassah Mount Scopus hospital, the volunteer said. Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was a "reaction to the crimes of the occupation" that showed the "intifada" – or uprising – was continuing. Taharlev was doing his army service through the hesder program, which combines military service with Torah study. His father, Ohad, heads the Israeli program at Midreshet Lindenbaum, a women’s yeshiva in Jerusalem. His mother, Avigail, is a department head at the Education Ministry. Ohad Taharlev, speaking at the entrance to his house in the settlement of Talmon shortly after his son’s death was announced, said he first heard about the attack at around 9:45 A.M., when he was almost at his office, and promptly called his son’s deputy company commander. “I understood very quickly what had happened,” he said. “I called everyone and told them to come home.” “I had seven children, and now I have six,” Taharlev continued. “It’s a very difficult feeling.” He described his son as “a boy who was full of life. He never got angry ... It’s a great loss.” The Tekoa yeshiva, where Elchai Taharlev studied as part of his hesder program, said he “embodied the combination of love of Torah and dedication to the Jewish people.” The Talmon local council said he was “talented, modest and very, very loved,” adding, “Grief rends the hearts of his neighbors, friends, members of his youth group and all the many residents of the community who knew Elchai and admired him.” President Reuven Rivlin also eulogized him. “Today we lost a beloved son, Elchai Taharlev, in Israel’s ongoing battle to ensure its own security and that of its citizens,” he said. “I want to send my deepest condolences to the Taharlev family and the entire community of Talmon and to wish the wounded soldier a speedy recovery.” “We will not let terror weaken us,” Rivlin added. “Israeli society is strong, and we must stand firm, together, to guard our country and our land.” On Saturday, three people were hurt in a stabbing attack in the Old City in Jerusalem. A police officer was moderately wounded, two civilians were lightly hurt and the suspected assailant, a 17-year-old Palestinian from Nablus, was shot dead. A Palestinian from East Jerusalem was shot and killed last Wednesday by police officers after pulling a pair of scissors and trying to stab a group of officers by the Old City's Damascus Gate. This is a developing story.

News article:
JERUSALEM, April 14 (Reuters) - A Palestinian man fatally stabbed a woman on Jerusalem's transit network on Friday, Israeli police said, as Christians marked Good Friday and Muslims held prayers at respective holy sites nearby. The incident occurred in a train carriage on the light rail network near Jerusalem's municipality building and the walled Old City. TV footage showed blood on the floor of the carriage with police officers restraining a man and carrying him away. A police spokesman said the assailant was apprehended and the victim was an Israeli woman in her twenties, but Israel Radio said she was a 23-year-old British student. It was not immediately possible to resolve the conflicting accounts. The Shin Bet domestic security service identified the assailant as 57-year-old Jamil Tamimi and said he was a Palestinian from Arab East Jerusalem with mental health problems who was convicted in 2011 for sexually assaulting his daughter. "This is one of many instances where a Palestinian suffering personal strife ... chooses to carry out an attack in order to find release for his problems," the Shin Bet statement said. It added that the assailant had previously tried to commit suicide by to swallow a razor blade. Friday is sometimes a day of heightened tensions in Jerusalem's Old City when tens of thousands of Muslim worshippers come to pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. On Good Friday each year, Christians hold a procession along the Via Dolorosa in the Old City, retracing what they believe was the route that Jesus took to his crucifixion. A wave of street attacks by Palestinians in Israel, Jerusalem and the Israeli-occupied West Bank since October 2015 has killed 37 Israelis and two American tourists. At least 242 Palestinians have died during the period of sporadic violence. Israel says at least 162 of the Palestinians killed had launched stabbing, shooting or car ramming attacks. Others died during clashes and protests. Israel has accused the Palestinian leadership of inciting the violence. The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank, denies incitement and charges that in many cases, Israel has used excessive force in thwarting attackers armed with rudimentary weapons.

A British student was killed and two Israelis were injured in a "terror" attack carried out by a knife-wielding Palestinian in Jerusalem's light rail on Friday noon, Israeli officials said. (Xinhua/Guo Yu) JERUSALEM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A British student was killed and two Israelis were injured in a "terror" attack carried out by a knife-wielding Palestinian in Jerusalem's light rail on Friday noon, Israeli officials said. The woman casualty, identified by police spokeswoman Luba Samri as a 25-year-old tourist and a student from England, was stabbed by a 57-year-old Palestinian passenger in the light rail. A spokesperson for the MDA emergency medical service said the woman, whose name was not disclosed, received a CPR at the scene before she was rushed to the Sha'arey Tzedek Hospital in Jerusalem. About an hour later, the hospital announced that she succumbed to her wounds. According to Samri, initial investigation showed that the assailant went on the light rail as a passenger. When the rail reached the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) Square rail stop, near East Jerusalem, he pulled out a knife and stabbed the British tourist. An Israeli man and a pregnant woman, who were apparently injured as the rail went into an emergency brake, also needed hospital care, the MDA spokesperson said. They sustained light injuries, according to the spokesperson. The police first said the assailant was shot but later Samri said that a policeman who was on the rail noticed the incident and arrested him without shooting. Samri described the stabber as a "mentally disturbed" Palestinian from Ras al-Amud, a Palestinian neighborhood of East Jerusalem, a territory that Israel had occupied in the 1967 Middle East War and later annexed in a move never recognized by the international community. Samri added the suspect holds an Israeli ID. The rail service in the city was temporarily halted, said a statement by Citipass, the company that operates the rail. The attack came amidst the Jewish holiday of Passover. It also came amidst a spate of violence that broke out in September 2015. Since the beginning of the unrest, Palestinians have killed 41 Israelis and two U.S. nationals, while Israeli forces and civilians killed at least 241 Palestinians, a Jordanian, and two African asylum seekers, most of them alleged attackers, according to Israel. Israel accuses the Palestinian National Authority of "inciting" the unrest. The Palestinians say it is the result of 50 years of Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, home to more than five million Palestinians.

A young British woman was stabbed to death with a kitchen knife while riding on Jerusalem’s light rail on Friday, officials said. An off-duty police officer and a passerby wrestled the terrorist, a Palestinian man from East Jerusalem, to the ground before he could harm anyone else. Two other people were lightly injured when the tram made an emergency stop. The fatality was later identified as Hannah Bladon, 21, an exchange student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Medics from the Magen David Adom ambulance service carried out CPR on Bladon at the scene before taking her to Jerusalem’s Hadassah Hospital Mount Scopus for treatment.

The terrorist was identified as Jamil Tamimi, 57, from the Ras al-Amoud neighborhood of East Jerusalem, by the Shin Bet security service. “According to an initial investigation, it seems he suffers from mental problems,” a police spokesperson said. Earlier this year, Tamimi tried to commit suicide by swallowing a razor blade, according to the Shin Bet. He was also found guilty of sexually abusing his daughter in 2011. “This is another case, out of many, where a Palestinian who is suffering from personal, mental or moral issues chooses to carry out a terror attack in order to find a way out of their problems,” the Shin Bet said in a statement.

The spate of Palestinian attacks that began in October 2015 was dubbed the “lone wolf” intifada, as many of the attacks were carried out by individuals who were not connected to any terror group.

News article:
A “mentally unstable” Palestinian man was detained Friday, after committing a stabbing inside the Jerusalem Light Rail, leaving one Britsh woman in her twenties dead, according to official Israeli sources. Though Israeli media initially reported that an Israeli woman in her twenties was seriously injured, it was later reported that the woman, a British national studying in Israel, succumbed to her wounds at the hospital. Israeli media also intially reported that the Palestinian was “neutralized” — a term often used by Israeli authorities and media in instances of such attacks to refer to the attacker being killed, injured, or detained — Haaretz later reported that the Palestinian man, who was recently released from a psychiatric hospital, was detained. According to Ma’an News Agency, Commander Yoram Halevy, who is in charge of the Israel police’s Jerusalem district, said that the Palestinian man who conducted the stabbing is a “mentally unstable” 57-year-old Jerusalemite, and has a prior criminal police record for domestic violence. Israeli sources later identified the man as Jamil al-Tamimi. According to Haaretz, al-Tamimi was a resident of the Ras al-Amoud neighborhood of occupied East Jerusalem, located just outside of the Damascus Gate area of the Old City. Israeli media added that, while one woman in her twenties was injured with a knife, two other Israelis, including a pregnant woman in her thirties and a man in his fifties, were indirectly injured when the train came to a sudden stop in the midst of the attack. The seriously injured woman was reportedly taken to Hadassah hospital, in Jerusalem. The Jerusalem Post reported that the attack took place while the light rail was on Jaffa Street across from the Old City’s Jaffa Gate. Locals said that Israeli forces imposed a siege on the entrances of Jerusalem’s Old City following the incident. An Israeli police spokesperson confirmed the incident in a written statement, saying that Israeli police units were deployed at the scene of the attack “in the center of the town,” adding that the attacker was detained. The spokesperson confirmed that the woman in her twenties was critically injured and was taken to hospital for treatment, and that “heightened security” was ongoing “in the center of town as well as in and around the Old City.”

Israeli security forces gather at the site of a stabbing in Jerusalem on April 14, 2017 A Palestinian man stabbed a British woman to death on Friday near Jerusalem's Old City, where thousands of Jewish and Christian pilgrims were gathered for religious holidays. The 23-year-old student was rushed to hospital with serious wounds but later died, according to the emergency services. The attack took place on a tram close to the Old City, where thousands of Christians from around the world marked Good Friday as Jews marked the week-long Passover holiday. Jerusalem police chief Yoram Halevy described the attacker, who was arrested, as "very mentally disturbed". Israel's domestic security agency Shin Bet named him as Jamil Tamimi, a 57-year-old Palestinian resident of east Jerusalem. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed "Islamic terrorism" for the killing of the woman, whom he described as a student, in "cold blood". He said security forces had thwarted "several attempted attacks in recent days", without giving details. According to police, the assailant pulled a knife out of a bag and stabbed the woman several times in the chest. Israeli security forces cordon off the site where a Palestinian stabbed a British woman in Jerusalem on April 14, 2017 An off-duty policeman travelling in the tram overpowered the attacker with the help of another passenger, the authorities said. "I was travelling with my family when I heard the cries of 'attack, attack'," the officer said. "I sounded the alarm then rushed to the scene of the attack. We overpowered him." The Hebrew University released a statement identifying the victim as Hannah Bladon, an exchange student from Britain's University of Birmingham. It said she had only started studying in Jerusalem in January and had been due to complete a single semester. A British foreign office spokeswoman said: "We can confirm the tragic death of a British national in Jerusalem. We are providing support to her family at this difficult time and are in touch with local authorities." Attacks targeting tourists are rare in Jerusalem and top Israeli officials voiced their dismay. "I am filled with sadness, as I received the terrible news of the murder of a young girl in the terror attack in Jerusalem," Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said. - High alert - "This week thousands have come through the ancient gates of Jerusalem, to celebrate the feasts of Passover and Easter throughout the city -- while the security forces work to ensure the safety of the dear residents and visitors to the city. And so we will continue to do. "Terror can never overcome us. Terror will never destroy our lives here."

Jews are allowed to visit but not pray at the site. Palestinian fears that Israel will seek to change those rules have been the source of repeated violence. A wave of unrest which erupted in October 2015 has claimed the lives of 260 Palestinians, 41 Israelis, two Americans, one Jordanian, an Eritrean, a Sudanese and a Briton, according to an AFP count. Most of the Palestinians killed were carrying out knife, gun or car-ramming attacks, the Israeli authorities say. Others were shot dead during protests or clashes, while some were killed in Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip. The violence has greatly subsided in recent months.

Others were shot dead during protests or clashes, while some were killed in Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip. The violence has greatly subsided in recent months.

© Magen David Adom / Twitter Hannah Bladon, a 21-year-old British exchange student was fatally stabbed in Jerusalem on Friday afternoon, reportedly by a Palestinian man with a history of mental illness and sexual abuse, who had recently been released from a psychiatric facility. The suspect has been apprehended."Radical Islamic terrorism is striking world capitals. Regretfully, terrorism struck today in Israel's capital - Jerusalem," said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement. "A Palestinian terrorist murdered in cold blood... a British citizen. In the name of all the People of Israel, I send my condolences to the family of the victim."The woman received wounds to her upper body and was initially in critical condition, Magen David Adom, an Israeli emergency services company, wrote on Twitter.Bladon was a theology student at the University of Birmingham in the UK, who had begun her guest studies at the Hebrew University, which confirmed her identity to the media, in January.The British embassy told the Guardian that it was in touch with local authorities following the incident, but didn't comment beyond that.Two more people were also injured in the incident, the Jerusalem Post said. A 50-year-old man was wounded when he tried to flee the scene, while a pregnant woman suffered an injury to her stomach when the light rail train made an abrupt stop. Both victims were transported to Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem.The Shin Bet domestic security service agency said that the suspect was identified as Jamil Tamimi, 57, a Palestinian from Arab East Jerusalem, Reuters reports. He was apprehended by officers and taken for questioning."It is one of many instances where a Palestinian suffering personal strife ... chooses to carry out an attack in order to find release for his problems," the Shin Bet statement said, as cited by Reuters.The attack took place on Good Friday, a Christian holiday commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. On this day many Christians flock to Jerusalem to join a procession in the Old City. According to tradition, the area is where Christ walked on the way to being crucified.There has recently been a rise in the number of attacks committed by Palestinians in public places in Jerusalem and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. According to Israeli authorities , the current spate of violence began on September 13, 2015.Since that date, 48 people have been killed in terrorist attacks and 713 people, including four Palestinians, have been injured.There have been 174 stabbing attacks and 113 attempted stabbings, 143 shootings, 57 vehicle ramming attacks and one bus bombing, the Israeli Foreign Ministry reported.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) – A spokesperson of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said earlier that the Palestinian attacker rammed his vehicle into a group of civilians at the Gush Etzion Junction, south of Jerusalem and injured one person. The ministry described the Palestinian man, identified as Sohaib Mashahreh, 21, as "a victim of the Israeli army’s death game they play against Palestinians," the WAFA news agency said. The ministry stressed that Israeli soldiers kill Palestinian nationals in Israeli-occupied areas on a daily basis, citing the Palestinians’ alleged attacks on Israelis as the reason for opening fire.

Tel Aviv – A Palestinian stabbed and lightly wounded four people in Tel Aviv before being arrested Sunday, the latest violence in a wave of attacks by Palestinians in the last year and a half, Israeli police said. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld called the violence a “terror attack” and said the 18-year-old suspect was being questioned by police. The attack took place on a street near the city’s popular beachfront. Security camera footage showed the assailant accosting several people in a hotel lobby. The owner of an art gallery in the area told reporters he also entered her establishment, punching her in the ear and stabbing her before fleeing. First responder teams treated four victims, all of whom are listed in light condition, suffering from bruises and stabbings. The wounded included two men and a woman from the area near the Herods Hotel and another man closer to the Atarim Square. All were evacuated in ambulances to Ichilov hospital. Yossi Eckler a volunteer EMT with United Hatzalah EMS teams, who was the first responder on the scene said: “When I arrived at the hotel we found two men and one woman lightly injured in the lobby. They were suffering from wounds in their upper body. While treating them together with other EMTs from the ambu-cycle unit who arrived after me, we were told of another wounded man outside of the hotel. EMTs promptly ran to treat him as well.” Israel says the violence is fueled by Palestinian incitement. Palestinians say it stems from anger over 50 years of occupation.

News article:
(Reuters) — Iran is sending advanced weapons and military advisers to Yemen’s rebel Houthi movement, stepping up support for its Shiite ally in a civil war whose outcome could sway the balance of power in the Middle East, regional and Western sources say. Iran’s enemy Saudi Arabia is leading a Sunni Arab coalition fighting the Houthis in the impoverished state on the tip of the Arabian peninsula – part of the same regional power struggle that is fuelling the war in Syria. Sources with knowledge of the military movements, who declined to be identified, say that in recent months Iran has taken a greater role in the two-year-old conflict by stepping up arms supplies and other support. This mirrors the strategy it has used to support its Lebanese ally Hezbollah in Syria. A senior Iranian official said Major General Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Qods Force – the external arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps – met top IRGC officials in Tehran last month to look at ways to “empower” the Houthis. “At this meeting, they agreed to increase the amount of help, through training, arms and financial support,” the official said. “Yemen is where the real proxy war is going on and winning the battle in Yemen will help define the balance of power in the Middle East.” Iran rejects accusations from Saudi Arabia that it is giving financial and military support to the Houthis in the struggle for Yemen, blaming the deepening crisis on Riyadh. But Iran’s actions in Yemen seem to reflect the growing influence of hardliners in Tehran, keen to pre-empt a tougher policy towards Iran signaled by U.S. President Donald Trump. Brigadier General Ahmed Asseri, spokesman for the Arab coalition fighting the Houthis, told Reuters: “We don’t lack information or evidence that the Iranians, by various means, are smuggling weapons into the area. “We observe that the Kornet anti-tank weapon is on the ground, whereas before it wasn’t in the arsenal of the Yemeni army or of the Houthis. It came later.” A Houthi leader said coalition accusations that Iran was smuggling weapons into Yemen were an attempt to cover up Saudi Arabia’s failure to prevail in an intractable war in which at least 10,000 people have been killed. “The Saudis don’t want to admit their failings so they are searching for false justifications … after two years of the aggression that the United States and Britain are involved in,” the Houthi leader, who declined to be named, told Reuters. Iran’s activities have alarmed Sunni Muslim countries in the Middle East, with one senior official from a neighboring country saying: “We want Iran to stop exporting Shiism in the region, whether in Yemen or elsewhere.” Saudi Arabia intervened in Yemen’s civil war in 2015 to back President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi after he was ousted from the capital Sanaa by the Houthis. Government forces in the south and east hold most of Yemen’s territory, while the Houthis control most population centers in the northwest, including Sanaa. A former senior Iranian security official said Iran’s hardline rulers planned to empower Houthi militia in Yemen to “strengthen their hand in the region”. “They are planning to create a Hezbollah-like militia in Yemen. To confront Riyadh’s hostile policies … Iran needs to use all its cards,” the former official said. A Western diplomat in the Middle East agreed: “Iran has long been trying to cultivate portions of the Houthi militias as a disruptive force in Yemen. “This is not to say that the Houthis are Hezbollah, but they do not need to be to achieve Iran’s goals, which is to encircle the Saudis, expand its influence and power projection in the region and develop levers of unconventional pressure.” Sources say Iran is using ships to deliver supplies to Yemen either directly or via Somalia, bypassing coalition efforts to intercept shipments. Western sources say once the ships arrive in the region, the cargoes are transferred to small fishing boats, which are hard to spot because they are so common in these waters. Favored areas are believed to include fishing coves around the port of Mukalla, even though that would require smuggling men or equipment to make a long risky journey to the main Houthi-controlled districts. The coalition ejected al-Qaida from the area last year, but still cannot prevent the smuggling of weapons and people, according to sources familiar with the waters. The Arab coalition’s General Asseri acknowledged the difficulties of policing 2,700 km of coastline around Yemen. “You cannot observe this length of coast even if you bring in all the navies of the world,” he said. “If we stop movement of those small boats, this will affect fishing by normal people.” From September 2015 until March 2016, the French and Australian navies frequently intercepted weapons which officials said were most likely bound for the Houthis. A U.S. defense official said Iranian weapons smuggling to the Houthis had continued apace since March last year, when the seizures stopped. The equipment included long-range ballistic missiles capable of reaching deep into Saudi Arabia. “There is no plausible explanation for these weapons’ appearance other than outside assistance. We assess that assistance has likely come from Iran,” the U.S. official said. Nic Jenzen-Jones, a military arms specialist and director of Armament Research Services, which has tracked Iranian equipment ending up in Yemen, also said quantities had increased. “We have seen some more success in sea-based transfers over the last few months and I suspect the general uptick in the frequency of Iranian arms that we are documenting is partially a result of more successful deliveries by sea,” Jenzen-Jones said. Evidence of more sophisticated equipment suspected of being used by the Houthis has emerged in recent attacks. On Jan. 30, a Saudi frigate was attacked near the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah, in an operation that Saudi official media blamed on the Houthis. The U.S. Navy said an unmanned remote-controlled boat laden with explosives rammed the Saudi vessel in the first known strike by a “drone” attack boat, and the Houthis had likely used technology supplied by Iran. In another development this month, a Yemeni government source told Reuters a coast guard boat was destroyed near al-Mokha by mines laid by the Houthis. Jenzen-Jones said the quality of Iranian munitions had improved of late. “Recent transfers of arms and munitions have also included Iranian Ababil series UAVs (drones), fitted with high explosive warheads and used by Houthis to engage high-value targets, such as radar and Patriot missile batteries,” he said. Anti-ship and man-portable missiles were also suspected to have been transferred, he said. In addition to the weapons, Iranian and regional sources said Tehran was providing Afghan and Shiite Arab specialists to train Houthi units and act as logistical advisers. These included Afghans who had fought in Syria under Qods Force commanders. Reuters has reported this same covert approach was used in Syria in 2014 before Iran took a more open role in that war.

SANAA: Yemen’s war has killed around 7,700 people and wounded 42,500 others, according to UN figures, since a Saudi-led Arab coalition intervened in support of the government two years ago. The conflict underscores the regional rivalry between Iran, a supporter of Yemen’s Shiite Houthi rebels, and Saudi Arabia, which heads the nine-member coalition. An overview: • On March 26, 2015, the coalition launches operation “Decisive Storm” with airstrikes on Houthi rebels to defend embattled President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi, who seeks shelter in Riyadh. The coalition also comprises the Gulf countries Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE along with Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Sudan. A month later, it is renamed operation “Restoring Hope.” The goal is to defeat the Shiite rebels who have controlled the capital since September 2014 in addition to large swathes of land in northern, central and western Yemen. • On July 17, 2015, the government announces the liberation of southern Aden province after more than four months of fighting; in August 2015, the coalition supplements its air power with hundreds of ground troops; by mid-August, loyalist forces have retaken the south, but face a growing presence of militants from Al-Qaeda and Daesh. • In February 2016, Riyadh says loyalist forces control “more than three quarters” of Yemen, despite trouble advancing in the southwestern province of Taiz and in Marib, central Yemen. Three months of UN-brokered peace talks in Kuwait end in stalemate, and coalition aircraft resume strikes on Sanaa on Aug. 9, 2016. • On Jan. 7, pro-government troops backed by coalition planes and ships launch operation “Golden Spear” around the strategic Bab Al-Mandab Strait, between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. • The UN and US organize three rounds of fruitless peace talks, in June and December 2015 in Switzerland and in April 2016 in Kuwait. Seven truces are agreed, but all broken. The severing in January 2016 of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran complicates the task for diplomats. • The internationally-recognized government, led by Hadi, establishes a “provisional” base in the port city of Aden in late September 2016. Two months later, the rebels and allied forces of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh form a government of their own in Sanaa, dousing hopes of a UN-brokered national unity government. • On Sept. 28, 2015, an airstrike smashes a wedding hall in southwestern Mokha, killing 131 people. The coalition denies responsibility. On Aug. 15, 2016, a coalition planes bomb a hospital in Abs, northwestern Yemen, the fourth strike in a year on a medical facility run by the non-governmental organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), or Doctors Without Borders. MSF says 19 people died and 24 were wounded. • On Oct. 8, 2016, an airstrike kills 140 people and wounds 525 others at a funeral in Sanaa. The coalition belatedly acknowledges responsibility. Washington steps up airstrikes against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which has benefitted from the chaos to gain influence. • AQAP loses territory to the Daesh which on March 20, 2015 claims responsibility for the first time for attacks against two Shiite mosques in Sanaa that kill 142 people. A botched Jan. 29 anti-AQAP raid by US special forces results in the deaths of a US Navy SEAL and multiple civilians — including women and children. According to the UN, the fighting has displaced more than three million people, and more than two thirds of Yemen’s population of around 18.8 million people need aid. Some 7.3 million people are estimated to be close to starvation and 462,000 children suffer from serious malnutrition. Without $2.1 billion in international aid, the UN warns that Yemen will suffer a famine in 2017.

Al Mukalla: Government troops are now in control of 80 per cent of Yemen’s territory, two years after a Saudi-led Arab coalition entered the war, Yemeni President Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi said in an interview with the Saudi daily Al Riyadh published on Sunday. The emboldened president said his forces would press on with the offensive on the Iran-backed Al Houthi rebels until they are forced to the negotiating table and honour previous commitments. Hadi praised Saudi King Salman Bin Abdul Aziz for his “strategic” and “brave” decision to enter the war on March 26, 2015. He also predicted that the Yemeni crisis would “soon” be over, but warned that there would be a heightened military escalation in the interim. The internationally-recognised president said he shared the same concerns with the new US administration about Iran’s designs in the region. “I think the new stance regarding Yemen is great,” he said. “Not only does it reject Al Houthi influence, it also favours designating it as a terrorist group.” Hadi, currently based in the Saudi capital, was forced to flee Sana’a in February 2015 after an Al Houthi coup installed an allied ruling council. After escaping house arrest, he shifted government headquarters to Aden. Al Houthis were marching towards the city but were stopped when the Saudi-led coalition began its air strike campaign and was able to blunt their advance. The massive air power has since then tilted the war in Hadi’s favour. Yemeni forces are making considerable progress along the western coast and outside Sana’a. On Sunday, the state-run Saba news agency said government forces reached the edges of Hesi Salem region, north of the Red Sea town of Mokha after pushing Al Houthis out of the Al Zahari region. The current offensive in western Yemen was launched in January when hundreds of coalition-backed forces marched from Aden towards strategic locations on Bab Al Mandab strait. The Al Houthi-controlled city of Hodeidah is the final destination of the offensive. Meanwhile in Taiz, residents said on Saturday a girl was killed by an Al Houthi sniper in the eastern part of the city where clashes between rebels and government forces have killed dozens.

News article:
Sanaa (AFP) - Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in Yemen's rebel-held capital on Sunday in a show of support for the insurgents, two years after a Gulf coalition intervened against the rebels. The Iran-backed Huthi rebels staged a show of force over the weekend with the mass rally in Sanaa and a symbolic court ruling against Yemen's embattled president, whose troops are supported by the Saudi-led Gulf coalition. Crowds converged on Sabeen Square in Sanaa, raising banners in protest against the Saudi-led intervention and chanting a vow to "resist to the end". "We came back today to Sabeen Square to send a message to Arabs and Muslims: does your religion allow you to attack a people in its totality without any reason?" Abdullah Qadiry told AFP at Sabeen Square. Former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, a Huthi ally and political rival of current head of state Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi, appeared briefly in person at the rally to thunderous applause. Sunday's protest came a day after a rebel court in Sanaa sentenced Hadi to death in absentia for high treason. The court found Hadi guilty of "usurping the title of president after the end of his term in office... instigating attacks by Saudi Arabia and undermining the independence and integrity of the Republic of Yemen", the rebel-controlled Saba agency said. Six members of the Hadi government were also sentenced to death. Hadi, whose two-year term in office expired in February 2014, now lives in Saudi Arabia, although he also visits his government's temporary capital of Aden. - Iranian 'plot' - The president was placed under house arrest after the Huthis overran the capital in September 2014, and later fled to the southern port city of Aden. The Gulf coalition intervened with air strikes on March 26, 2015, after Huthis advanced on other parts of the country including Aden. Hadi's forces have since gained ground in the south, but the Huthis still control the capital and strategic ports on the Red Sea coast. Story continues The government-run Saba news agency on Sunday ran an editorial slamming the "rise of the Huthi militia" as an Iranian "plot" targeting Yemen and neighbouring Saudi Arabia. On Saturday, Ali Abdullah Saleh denounced Riyadh's role in the conflict. "Free Yemenis will continue to choose resistance, as long as the coalition led by Saudi Arabia continues to choose war," Saba quoted Saleh as saying in a speech marking the anniversary. Rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Huthi said the coalition had been "living under the illusion that they can take Yemen in a week or a month... but have sunk into the mud". - Possible 'war crime' - Home to one of Al-Qaeda's most dangerous branches, Yemen has a complex history of civil unrest. The rebels, who had long complained of marginalisation, in 2011 mobilised protests demanding economic and political reform that led to Saleh's resignation the following year after decades in power. But the Huthis and Saleh put their differences behind them in 2014, as the rebels took Sanaa with the support of troops still loyal to the former president. More than 7,700 people have been killed and three million displaced in Yemen since March 2015, the United Nations says. This month, 42 people, mainly Somali refugees, were killed when a boat transporting them out of Yemen came under air attack off the main Red Sea port of Hodeida. On Sunday, Human Rights Watch said there was evidence the attack may have come from the coalition and could amount to a war crime. Saudi Arabia has denied involvement and called for the UN to take control of Hodeida port, which is currently in the hands of the Huthis. The UN has described Yemen as the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today, with fighting leaving millions desperate for food and shelter. It says the country also faces a serious risk of famine this year. burs-jj-pho-mh/ny/srm

Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said that the Yemeni people are fully ready to sacrifice their lives to preserve their freedom, dignity and independence, Yemen’s al-Masirah television network reported on Saturday evening.He further described the unity among the Yemeni people as the main factor of resistance in the country.Condemning the Saudi attacks on Yemen, the Ansarullah leader said the enemy’s missiles have targeted 'our children'.He added the US, Israel and certain world countries have also targeted the Islamic Ummah as the Islamic countries cannot tolerate any kind of domination over themselves and they stand against the US plots.Referring to the plots hatched by the US to ruin the region, al-Houthi said there are amicable ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, and the two are coordinating their anti-region schemes .The presence of Riyadh in Yemen is in line with serving Tel Aviv interests, the Yemeni leader said.Violation against Yemen, however, has made the country to achieve good military successes, al-Houthi said.Saudi Arabia with the help of nine other Arab countries, except Oman, has been mounting massive attacks on Yemen since March 26, 2015, to give power back to the resigned Yemeni president and prevent the Yemeni revolutionary forces from taking power.

This statement came after coalition warplanes hit a marketplace three times in Mustaba District of Yemen’s Hajjah province. The air strikes killed 119 people and wounded 47 more, said a spokesperson for the healthcare directorate. On March 21, 2016,Ould Cheikh Ahmed said that the parties to the Yemeni conflict had agreed to hold a new round of talks in Kuwait and had confirmed their readiness to set up a national unity government. The media announced March 28 that the Houthis and Saudi Arabia had exchanged prisoners. A total of 100 Houthi rebels were swapped for nine Saudi Arabian prisoners. A ceasefire agreement entered into force at midnight April 10, 2016. However, fighting continued in some parts of the country. The United Nations brokered another round of peace talks in Kuwait that started on April 21. The talks almost failed several times because their participants accused each other of violating the ceasefire agreement. During the talks, the government of Yemen and its Houthi opponents agreed to exchange prisoners in the run-up to the holy Muslim month of Ramadan. On June 1, the media reported that Houthi rebels released 16 prisoners from the Abu Al-Abbas people’s militia unit seized in the Taiz province in central Yemen, in exchange for 19 of their supporters. The parties to the Yemeni conflict also agreed to release all children who had been imprisoned. On June 7, the media reported that the Saudi Arabian-led coalition had transferred 52 teenagers who had sided with Houthi rebels fighting government forces to the Government of Yemen. On June 15, 2016, the UAE announced the withdrawal of the country’s servicemen from the Saudi Arabian-led Arab coalition’s operation against the Houthi rebels in Yemen. On June 18, the parties to the Yemeni conflict exchanged prisoners near the city of Taiz in southwestern Yemen, under the mediation of local tribes. The parties exchanged about 200 people, namely, the Arab coalition released 118 people, while Houthi rebels freed another 76. According to the UAE media, this deal had nothing to do with the result of the intra-Yemeni peace talks in Kuwait. Although intra-Yemeni talks continued for 70 days, the parties failed to reach any specific agreement, despite the UN special envoy’s attempts to persuade them to approve a road map stipulating the abolition of previously adopted decisions on running the country by Houthi rebels who had seized power. On June 29, 2016, Ould Cheikh Ahmed said that the intra-Yemeni talks had been put off until the end of the celebrations marking the end of Ramadan. Talks between the Yemeni government delegation and that of the Houthi movement opposing it resumed in Kuwait July 16, 2016. On July 31, 2016, Hadi approved the UN-backed draft agreement on resolving the Yemeni crisis. The agreement, proposed by Ould Cheikh Ahmed, urges Houthi rebels and forces, loyal to Saleh, to lay down their weapons. The document also calls for withdrawing rebel units from Sanaa and the cities of Taiz and Al Hudaydah and establishing a military committee responsible for surrendering weapons and withdrawing insurgents from the cities. A political dialogue was set to resume 45 days after signing the draft agreement by the parties. Hadi instructed the government delegation at the talks in Kuwait to sign the draft agreement. In turn, the government delegation officially notified the UN special envoy that it would approve the document, provided that the rebels signed it by August 7. This round of peace talks ended August 6, with the parties failing to reach any agreement and fighting involving the Saudi Arabian-led coalition soon resumed in the country. On October 24, 2016, the media reported that Ould Cheikh Ahmed had officially submitted a plan backed by the United Nations for comprehensively resolving the national crisis to the Yemeni government delegation and that of the Houthi rebels. The new UN plan stipulated a number of mutual concessions. The Houthis were expected to withdraw from the capital. In response, Vice President Ali Mohsen Ahmar was supposed to resign, and Hadi’s powers were to have been seriously curtailed. The parties to the Yemeni conflict rejected this plan. Despite his numerous efforts, Ould Cheikh Ahmed has so far failed to persuade the warring parties to sit down at the negotiating table after three abortive rounds of talks have not helped resolve the Yemeni armed conflict sputtering on for almost two years. As of October 2016, almost 10,000 people had been killed in Yemen, according to UN estimates. The total of 21.2 million Yemeni citizens, which is 80 percent of the country’s population, are in need of urgent assistance, while another 14 million are malnourished, and seven million are on the verge of dying from starvation. There are over three million internally displaced people, as well as over 300,000 refugees. Most Yemenis are unable to drink clean water and use the sanitary infrastructure. The national healthcare system has been virtually paralyzed due to the destruction of the appropriate infrastructure by air strikes and a shortage of medication and other preparations. Since 2015, 10,000 children have died due to a shortage of medical services. More and more Yemenis are affected by grave diseases such as cholera, acute forms of pneumonia and measles.

News article:
Dubai: Iran may deploy more advanced military capabilities to Yemen to support the Al Houthis and militia of former strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen, warns a group of analysts known for research in global security threats. The analysts say the increase in Iranian involvement is to offset the gains made by Yemeni government troops supported by the Saudi-led Arab coalition forces. Increased Iranian role will prolong Yemen’s civil war and make the conflict more sectarian, worsening Yemen’s humanitarian crisis and allowing Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to expand its support base within Yemen, they say. “The deployment of inter-operable proxy forces is part of Iran’s evolution of a form of hybrid warfare that will allow it to project significant force far from its borders and fundamentally alter the balance of power in the region. Iran may increase its engagement in Yemen if US support for the Saudi-led coalition threatens the Al Houthi-Saleh faction’s survival,” they say. The Critical Threats Project run by the public policy think tank the American Enterprise Institute has published the analysis on their website, providing information on Iranian military assistance to Yemeni rebels. “Iran may attempt to incorporate the Al Houthis into its Axis of Resistance coalition, which Iran uses to contain the US and its regional allies,” the report stresses, warning that further escalation in the Yemeni civil war will threaten freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, risking both global commercial markets and the US Navy’s freedom of movement in the region. The analysis claims that Iran had attempted to smuggle over 2,000 small arms into Yemen in 2015 and 2016, in addition to a large stockpile of other weapons. “Iran likely facilitated the development of an Al Houthi-Saleh naval mining program. Mines struck a government coast guard ship near Mokha port, Taiz governorate on March 11 and a fishing vessel near Midi district, northwestern Hajjah governorate on March 8. Iran provides sophisticated weaponry that allows the Al Houthi-Saleh faction to hold terrain, counter Saudi-led coalition capabilities, and threaten US freedom of movement in the Red Sea,” it warns. The Al Houthi-Saleh militias possess a large number of Iran-supplied sophisticated weapons and technological devices, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, the technology for unmanned remote-controlled boat attacks as happened to a Saudi vessel in the Red Sea on January 3, anti-ship cruise missiles used to fire at the USS Mason in October 2016, and anti-tank guided weapons that were not part of Yemen’s pre-civil war stockpiles, the analysis asserts. It reveals that Al Houthi-Saleh ballistic missile launches increased in 2017 and argues that Hezbollah or IRGC-QF likely provided technical expertise to modify pre-existing Scud missile stockpiles for longer range capabilities.

In an exclusive interview with IRNA, Prof. Bansidhar Pradhan, former Chairperson of Centre for West Asian Studies (CWAS) at School of International Studies (SIS) in Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi said, “Yemen, which is facing serious humanitarian crisis right now, at the first step requires a sustainable cease-fire and a cessation of air strikes which have caused damage to the infrastructure of the country and had also killed civilians.After that point, the fate of the country should be left to people to decide for themselves about the type of government they required”.Criticizing the intervention by the external forces, Pradhan was of the view that Saudi Arabia, which is a monarch country, was afraid of creating the democratic system in Yemen which could be a threat to the foundations to its monarchy, and that led to its intervention.“Mindless airstrikes will never resolve the situation, and will only escalate further and engulf the whole area. Saudi government is not ready for a political solution. They want to finish Houthis and then want a political solution. I believe without the expulsion of the external powers, there cannot be some sort of political settlement to get out of this crisis. It should be resolved through political negotiations by the people of that country,” stressed the Indian expert.To a question on Iran’s being accused of arming the Houthis, Prof. Pradhan categorically rejected the accusation. He said that though Iran is blamed due to regional dynamics, but it is always insisting for negotiations.The Indian scholar, while slamming the international human rights watchdogs, said that it is very unfortunate that humanitarian crisis is continuing in Yemen without world attention. The UN and other major powers are not paying attention.“According to a UNICEF report, approximately 370,000 children are on the verge of starvation. At least the UN should not turn a blind eye to this grave situation”, emphasized Prof. Pradhan.The domestic conflict in Yemen began in 2015. At first it was between two factions claiming to constitute the Yemeni government, along with their supporters and allies. But, the Saudi-led intervention escalated the conflict and at present the country is facing a severe humanitarian crisis.The Saudi intervention, which has included widespread bombing of civilian areas, has been sharply condemned by the international community. But, Saudi Arabia and its allies have not been forced to stop the mindless airstrikes on civilians.According to the UN, from the beginning till March 2017 16,200 people have been killed in Yeman, including 10,000 civilians. Although the figure could be much more than that.As per media reports, millions of Yemenis have been deprived of water, food and electricity as a result of the conflict.267**1771

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — The jihadist insurgency in northern Sinai started in 2013, shortly after the Egyptian army led by current President Abdel Fattah Sisi has overthrown then-president Mohamed Morsi. Police and security forces have been the target of deadly attacks by Islamists in the area. Sinai’s militants pledged allegiance to Daesh in November 2014, taking the name of Wilayat Sinai. Most of the attacks by the group were carried out in North Sinai, but it also claimed responsibility for attacks in other regions, including the country’s capital Cairo.

News article:
The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for bombing two Egyptian churches as worshipers gathered to mark Palm Sunday, killing at least 43 people in the deadliest attacks on the Coptic Christian minority in recent memory. The attacks followed a Cairo church bombing in December and came weeks before a planned visit by Catholic Pope Francis intended to show support for Egypt's Christian minority. The first bombing at the Mar Girgis church in Tanta city north of Cairo killed 27 people, the health ministry said. "I just felt fire grabbing my face. I pushed my brother who was sitting next to me and then I heard people saying: 'explosion'," a wounded witness in hospital told state television. Emergency services had scrambled to the scene when another blast rocked Saint Mark's church in Alexandria where Coptic Pope Tawadros II had been leading a Palm Sunday service. Sixteen people including three police officers were killed in that attack, which the interior ministry said was caused by a suicide bomber who blew himself up when prevented from entering the church. The ministry said Tawadros was unharmed, and a church official said he left before the explosion. The private CBC Extra channel aired footage of the Alexandria blast, with CCTV showing what appeared to be the church entrance engulfed in a ball of flame and flying concrete moments after a security guard turned away a man. Eyewitnesses said a police officer detected the bomber before he blew himself up. At least 78 people were wounded in Tanta and 40 in Alexandria, the health ministry said. Officials denounced the violence as an attempt to sow divisions in Egypt, and Francis sent his "deep condolences" to Tawadros. IS claimed its "squads" carried out both attacks, in a statement by its self-styled Amaq news agency published on social media. After the bombings, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ordered military deployments to guard "vital and important infrastructure", his office said. State television reported that the interior minister sacked the provincial head of security and replaced him after the attack. There were bloodstains on the floor of the church in Tanta, next to shredded wooden benches. On March 29, the Mar Girgis church's Facebook page said a "suspicious" device had been found outside the building that security services removed. "I heard the blast and came running. I found people torn up... some people, only half of their bodies remained," said Nabil Nader, who lives in front of the Tanta church. Worshipers had been celebrating Palm Sunday, one of the holiest days in the Christian calendar, marking Jesus' triumphant entrance to Jerusalem. - Pope prays for victims - Francis, who is due to visit Cairo on April 28-29, offered prayers for the victims. "Let us pray for the victims of the attack unfortunately carried out today," he said in an Angelus prayer. "May the Lord convert the heart of those who sow terror, violence and death and also the heart of those who make weapons and trade in them." Copts, who make up about one tenth of Egypt's population of more than 92 million and who celebrate Easter next weekend, have been targeted by several attacks in recent months. Jihadists and Islamists accuse Copts of supporting the military overthrow of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, which ushered in a deadly crackdown on his supporters. In December, a suicide bombing claimed by IS killed 29 worshipers in a Cairo church adjacent to the papal seat. The group later released a video threatening Egypt's Christians with more attacks. A spate of jihadist-linked attacks in Egypt's restive Sinai Peninsula, including the murder of a Copt in the city of El Arish whose house was also burned, led some Coptic families to flee. About 250 Christians took refuge in the Suez Canal city of Ismailiya after IS released a video in February calling for attacks on the minority. U.S. President Donald Trump led international condemnation of Sunday's attacks. "So sad to hear of the terrorist attack in Egypt. U.S. strongly condemns. I have great confidence that President Al Sisi will handle situation properly," he tweeted. - String of attacks - Prime Minister Sherif Ismail condemned the attack, stressing Egypt's determination to "eliminate terrorism." The Cairo-based al-Azhar, an influential Sunni Muslim authority, said it aimed to "destabilize security and... the unity of Egyptians." Egypt's Copts have endured successive attacks since Morsi's ouster in July 2013. More than 40 churches were attacked nationwide in the two weeks after the deadly dispersal by security forces of two pro-Morsi protest camps in Cairo on August 14 that year, Human Rights Watch said. Sisi, who as then army chief helped remove Morsi, has defended his security forces and accused jihadists of attacking Copts in order to divide the country. In October 2011, almost 30 people -- mostly Coptic Christians -- were killed after the army charged at a protest outside the state television building in Cairo to denounce the torching of a church in southern Egypt. A few months earlier, the unclaimed New Year's Day bombing of a Coptic church killed more than 20 people in second city Alexandria.

At least 18 people were killed and 40 were wounded by a blast in front of a Christian church in Alexandria, Egypt on Palm Sunday, according to local reports, hours after at least 30 people were killed by a blast in the Nile Delta city of Tanta.

U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted: "So sad to hear of the terrorist attack in Egypt. U.S. strongly condemns. I have great confidence that President Al Sisi will handle situation properly." Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi said in a statement he had ordered the immediate deployment of soldiers to assist police in protecting "vital facilities" across the country. He condemned the attacks and summoned the National Defense Council to an urgent session. According to local reports, he also announced three days of national mourning. "The attack ... will only harden the determination (of the Egyptian people) to move forward on their trajectory to realize security, stability and comprehensive development," Sissi said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office released a statement in wake of the attacks, saying that, “Israel sends condolences to the families of those murdered in the attack in Egypt and wishes for recovery for the injured. The world must unite and fight terrorism everywhere.” Israel also restated its warnings telling Israelis in Sinai to return home immediately, citing the threat of terrorism. The U.S. embassy in Cairo tweeted in response to the attacks, saying "We condemn this hateful act targeting worshippers as they celebrated one of the most sacred days in Christianity. We grieve with all Egyptians as we express our most heartfelt condolences to the victims and their families and we hope for a speedy recovery for those injured in the attack." An unconfirmed video surfaced on social media claiming to show CCTV footage of one of the bombings. Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin tweeted his condolences and said, "We strongly condemn the heinous terror attacks on churches in Egypt on Palm Sunday today." The attacks were the latest in a series of assaults on Egypt's Christian minority, which makes up around 10 percent of the population of 92 million and has been repeatedly targeted by Islamic extremists. It comes just weeks before Pope Francis is due to visit Egypt.

A militant group called Liwa al-Thawra claimed responsibility for an April 1 bomb attack targeting a police training center in Tanta, which wounded 16 people. The group, believed to be linked to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, has mainly targeted security forces and distanced itself from attacks on Christians. In December, 25 were killed by a suicide bombing at Cairo's main Coptic cathedral. ISIS later claimed responsibility for the blast. Egypt has seen a spate of attacks since 2013, when the army deposed Egypt's former Islamist President Mohammad Morsi, the country's first democratically elected leader, following mass protests against his divisive rule. Christians backed Morsi's toppling by then-army chief al-Sissi, Egypt's current president. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

A second explosion has killed at least 11 people at a church in Alexandria, hours after a bomb at another church north of Cairo killed dozens of worshipers. The blast outside St. Mark's church in the coastal city of Alexandria on Sunday killed at least six people and wounded 35 in the second Palm Sunday attack on Coptic Christians, the Egyptian Health Ministry announced. An earlier blast at a church in Tanta, north of Cairo, killed at least 26 people and wounded dozens in an apparent attack on Coptic worshippers. A The New Arab correspondent reported that a suicide bomber blew himself up outside the Alexandria church, where Pope Tawadros II had been attending Palm Sunday mass. A church official told local media that the Pope had not been harmed in the attack and had left the church before the blast went off. State media said that at least two policemen had been killed in the Alexandria attack. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Sunday's blasts. Copts, who make up about one tenth of Egypt's population of more than 92 million and who celebrate Easter next weekend, have been targeted by several attacks in recent months. Pope Francis is due to visit Cairo on April 28-29 to show solidarity with Egypt's Christian community. Some experts have said the attack may be an attempt to force a cancellation. In December, a suicide bombing claimed by the Islamic State group killed 29 worshippers during Sunday mass in Cairo. The bombing of the church within a compound that also holds the seat of the Coptic papacy was the deadliest attack against the minority in recent memory. A spate of Islamic State group-linked attacks in Egypt's restive Sinai Peninsula, including the murder of a Copt in the city of al-Arish whose house was also burned, have led some Coptic families to flee their homes.

President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi called for a National Defence Council meeting in response to the attacks on Sunday, according to state TV.

A spate of Islamic State group-linked attacks in Egypt's restive Sinai Peninsula, including the murder of a Copt in the city of al-Arish whose house was also burned, have led some Coptic families to flee their homes. About 250 Christians took refuge in the Suez Canal city of Ismailiya after IS released a video in February calling for attacks on the religious minority. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi called for a National Defence Council meeting in response to the attacks on Sunday, according to state TV. Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid called Sunday's bombing "a failed attempt against our unity". "Terrorism hits Egypt again, this time on Palm Sunday," he tweeted.

Skip to comments. Palm Sunday attacks: ISIS says it carried out bombings at churches in Egypt that killed at least 37 Posted on by Enlightened1 The ISIS terror group has claimed responsibility for two separate Palm Sunday bombing attacks at Coptic Christian churches in Egypt that have killed 37 people and injured more than 100. The first blast happened at St. George church in the Nile Delta town of Tanta, where at least 26 people were killed and 71 others wounded, officials said. Television footage showed the inside of the church, where a large number of people gathered around what appeared to be lifeless, bloody bodies covered with papers. A second explosion was later reported at St. Mark's Cathedral in the coastal city of Alexandria, leaving at least 11 dead, and 35 injured. The attack came just after Pope Tawadros II -- leader of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria -- finished services, but aides told local media that he was unharmed. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks via its Aamaq media agency, after the group recently released a video vowing to step up attacks against Christians, who the group describes as "infidels" empowering the West against Muslims. 'CHRISTIANS ARE OUR FAVORITE PREY,' ISIS SAYS The blasts came at the start of Holy Week leading up to Easter, and just weeks before Pope Francis is due to visit Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country. "Either a bomb was planted or someone blew himself up," provincial governor Ahmad Deif told the state-run Nile TV channel, Sky News reported. The attack in Tanta was the latest in a series of assaults on Egypt's Christian minority, which makes up around 10 percent of the population and has been repeatedly targeted by Islamic extremists. Grand Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, head of Egypt's Al-Azhar  the leading center of learning in Sunni Islam  condemned the attacks, calling them a "despicable terrorist bombing that targeted the lives of innocents."

At least 40 people have been killed and more than 130 others were injured in separate bomb attacks on Sunday targeting two churches in northern Egypt belonging to the country's Coptic conmmunity in the deadliest attacks on the country's Christian minority in recent memory. The Daesh terror group has claimed responsibility both bombings of Egyptian churches. "Daesh squads carried out the attacks on two churches in Tanta and Alexandria," said the group's self-styled Amaq news agency in a statement published on social media accounts. The first blast took place during a Palm Sunday mass at the Mar Girgis Coptic Church in the Nile Delta city of Tanta about 120 kilometres (75 miles) from Cairo. At least 27 people were killed and 70 thers were injured in the attack. Images broadcast by private television stations showed bloodstains smearing the whitewashed walls of the church in Tanta next to shredded wooden benches. "The explosion took place in the front rows, near the altar, during the mass," General Tarek Atiya, the deputy to Egypt's interior minister in charge of relations with the media, told AFP. "I heard the blast and came running. I found people torn up... some people, only half of their bodies remained," said Nabil Nader, who lives in front of the Tanta church. Meanwhile, a second explosion outside a Saint Mark church in the Egyptian coastal city of Alexandria, killing at least 13 and wounding dozens more. Egypt's interior ministry has confirmed that a suicide bomber was behind the blast at the Alexandria church. The bomber tried to storm the church where Coptic Pope Tawadros II was leading a Palm Sunday service but blew himself up when police prevented him from entering, the ministry said in a statement. A Coptic Church official said Tawadros had left the church before the blast. Palm Sunday is a Christian feast commemorating the entry of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem. World leaders including French President Francois Hollande have expressed solidarity with Egypt following the deadly bombing. In a written statement after Sunday's attack, Hollande says "one more time, Egypt is hit by terrorists who want to destroy its unity and its diversity." Turkey's Foreign Ministry Sunday condemned the deadly bomb attack in a written statement saying, "We strongly condemn the atrocious terrorist attack in a church in the city of Tanta that resulted in many deaths and injuries." The statement also conveyed condolences to "the bereaved families and the entire Egyptian nation". Pope Francis, who planned to visit Egypt in the coming weeks, condemned the deadly church blast during Palm Sunday Mass, offering his "profound condolences" to Pope Tawadros II, the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church, and his "beloved Egyptian nation." The attacks in Tanta and in Alexandria were the latest in a series of assaults on Egypt's Christian minority, which makes up around 10 percent of the country's 90 million population and has been repeatedly targeted by terrorist groups. In December, a bomb blast struck a church in central Cairo, which killed more than 25 people and injured scores. A spate of terrorist-linked attacks in Egypt's restive Sinai Peninsula, including the murder of a Copt in the city of El Arish whose house was also burned, have led some Coptic families to flee their homes. About 250 Christians took refuge in the Suez Canal city of Ismailiya after Daesh released a video in February calling for attacks on the religious minority.

News article:
JEDDAH: Three women Egyptian police officers died in Sunday’s bombings of two Coptic Churches, the first females to die in the line of duty from the Egyptian police force. Egyptian Interior Ministry said that Brig. Gen. Nagwa Al-Haggar, 53, died heroically when she rushed to the aid of her male colleagues to prevent a suicide bomber from entering Church of St. Mark’s in Alexandria. The attacker detonated his bomb, killing Al-Haggar and Major Emad Al-Rakaybi. The two other female police sergeants, Asmaa Hussein and Omneya Roshdy, were among a total of seven police officers killed on Monday. Sgt. Asmaa Mohamed, a colleague of Hussein and Roshdy, told CBC channel that one of her colleagues was planning to get married in a month, while the other left two daughters behind. “But, despite everything, we continue to be on duty— whether me or my colleagues,” Mohamed said. Details on how the other two female officers died were not immediately available. A security source said that Al-Haggar “is considered the first woman to be killed during duty in the female police force in the history of the Interior Ministry,” Egyptian media reported. Due to the nature of Al-Haggar’s work, she never expected to become a victim of a terror attack. For several years, she worked peacefully with almost no great risks in the Work Permits Department at the Security Directorate of Alexandria. She was then summoned to secure the Church of St. Mark in Alexandria on Sunday. Al-Haggar was assigned to be in charge of inspecting people entering the church and to maintain the security of worshipers arriving for Palm Sunday services. Al-Haggar was conducting her inspections when she observed Major Al-Rakaybi and other police officers struggling with a man who was attempted to break into the church. Al-Haggar ran to Al-Rakaybi to assist him when the terrorist detonated his bomb, killing all Al-Haggar, Al-Rakaybi and other officers. Al-Haggar’s picture along with Al-Rakaybi were posted on the official Facebook page of the Egyptian Ministry of Interior with a caption: “When the terrorist was exposed by the security forces, he blew himself up with members of the designated security service outside the church, resulting in the martyrdom of a number of police officers from the Security Directorate of Alexandria.” WATCH: Stopped from entering church, terrorist explodes bomb Other male police officers killed in the attack were Essam Adeeb, Mohamed Ibrahim and Mohamed Hassan. Al-Haggar was close to the fight and did not back down despite the danger that began to emerge in the place, according to Egyptian media. Al-Haggar comes from a family of police officers — married to a major general and a mother of a captain. She graduated from the Police Academy in 1987. Last year, Al-Haggar lost a son, Mahab Ezz, who was a student in the Police Academy. Mahab died of a heart attack. Al-Haggar martyred shortly after marrying off her eldest son, Mahmoud Ezz, which aroused the sympathy of many Egyptians on social media. Daesh has reportedly claimed responsibility for the twin attack. Muslim extremists have increasingly targeted Egypt’s Coptic Christians, who are the largest ethno-religious minority in Egypt and consists roughly 10 percent of the country’s population. Earlier this year, Daesh released a video footage vowing to liberate Cairo and bring explosives. “To my brothers in captivity: rejoice, you believers, do not falter or grieve,” the jihadist said in the video. “I swear to God we will very soon liberate Cairo and free you from captivity. We will come bearing explosives. I swear we will, so rejoice you believers.”

News article:
CAIRO: The twin bombings of churches in Egypt suggest that Daesh militants are lashing out as they find themselves coming under increasing pressure in Iraq and Syria, analysts say. The group’s Egyptian affiliate which claimed Sunday’s attacks in the Nile Delta cities of Tanta and Alexandria has been centered in the Sinai Peninsula, where it has killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers. But Daesh has been unable to seize population centers there, unlike its early gains in Iraq and Syria, and it has also lost top militants to Egyptian military strikes in recent months. The militants have attacked Egyptian Coptic Christians before, but their campaign against the minority picked up in December with a Cairo church bombing that killed 29 people. In Sinai, Daesh militants killed seven Copts in January and February, forcing dozens of Christian families to flee the peninsula that borders Israel and the Palestinian Gaza Strip. Daesh and its supporters online have been “methodically introducing more radical sectarian concepts” to Egyptian militants since the December bombing, said Mokhtar Awad, a research fellow with George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. The December bombing in a church adjacent to the Coptic papal seat marked a shift in Daesh tactics. It was not until December 2016 when Daesh began a systematic campaign to target Coptic Christians in Egypt,” said Jantzen Garnett, an expert on the militants with the Navanti Group analytics company. As Daesh is “squeezed in Iraq and Syria it often conducts spectacular attacks elsewhere in an attempt to regain the narrative, boost morale and win recruits,” he said. In Iraq and Syria, where the group swept across northern Iraq, Daesh has faced consecutive defeats over the past year and is on the verge of losing control of Iraq’s second city Mosul. In a video released in February, Daesh attacked Christians as “polytheists” and promised there would be further attacks. After Sunday’s bombings in Tanta and Alexandria, the group said it had deployed two Egyptian suicide bombers against the “crusaders.” A defiant President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi reacted by declaring a three-month state of emergency. The Copts, who make up about 10 percent of Egypt’s 90 million people, have been attacked by militants for years, more so after the military overthrew President Muhammad Mursi in 2013. The Coptic Church was accused by the militants of supporting Mursi’s overthrow which led to a bloody crackdown on militants, although Muslim clerics and politicians also backed his ouster. Even before Mursi was toppled, militants had targeted the Christians, most notably in a 2011 New Year bombing of a church in Alexandria which police blamed on a group linked to Al-Qaeda. The Daesh group’s “sectarian attacks fuel those ideologically inclined to support the group, while showing it’s still ‘expanding’ despite battlefield setbacks,” said Zack Gold, a non-resident fellow with the Atlantic Center’s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East. The three church attacks in December and now April also suggest an expanded presence of militant cells west of the Suez Canal separating the Sinai proper from the rest of Egypt. Following the December bombing, Sissi said members of the jihadist cell who carried it out had been caught, but others remained on the run. Daesh “has struggled, with constant setbacks, to establish a sizable presence on the Egyptian mainland over the preceding years. These church bombings indicate they have a growing presence on the mainland,” said Garnett. Daesh affiliate’s predecessor in Egypt, Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis, had carried out several attacks targeting the police on the mainland before pledging allegiance to Daesh in November 2014. And several Daesh bombings and shootings took place in Cairo, also targeting policemen, before the December church bombing. Police arrested several cells and in November 2015 announced they had killed a top Daesh militant, Ashraf Al-Gharably, in a Cairo shootout.

News article:
More than 30 suspects have been arrested following two suicide attacks on Coptic churches in Egypt on Palm Sunday, in which more than 45 people were killed. Islamic State claimed responsibility for both attacks, one in Alexandria and the other in the Nile Delta city of Tanta. The Alexandria blast was at St Mark’s Coptic Cathedral and the Tanta explosion was at St George’s Church. Egyptian reports say the intelligence forces are working on identifying the two suicide bombers. On Sunday, the Tanta police also defused a bomb that had been placed by the police station in the city, which is next to a hospital.

Credit: Mohamed Abd El Ghany, Reuters Following the attacks, the Egyptian parliament on Tuesday unanimously approved Egyptian president Abdel-Fattah al-Sissi's decision to declare a three-month state of emergency. Ending emergency law had been a key demand during the 2011 uprising that ousted former President Hosni Mubarak, who had imposed a 30-year state of emergency to crush opposition. Its reinstatement will not affect day-to-day life, promised parliament speaker Ali Abdelaal, explaining it as a necessary measure at a time that requires exceptional laws. Perhaps addressing concerns about abuse of freedoms, Abdelaal, added that Egypt had been in a state of emergency for 30 years, so the Egyptian people would have to be prepared to take steps to fight terrorism for three months. Abdelaal also warned the press to be careful in its reporting, echoing comments by Sisi after the bombings: "It is up to all of us to protect this nation. This is a national and constitutional duty," he said. Open gallery view Praying in solidarity with Egyptian Copts, Ein Dor Church, Haifa, Israel.

ISIS meanwhile threatened more attacks against Egypt's Christians, stating online, "Let the crusaders and apostates know that they will pay a huge bill with their son's blood." Following the attacks, Egyptian army forces stepped up activity in the northern Sinai, where ISIS forces have been active, and reported exchanges of life fire with terrorists around el-Arish and in Rafah during the last two days. Egyptian security forces claim that in seven armed terrorists en route to carry out another attack in a Coptic Christians area were killed in the el-Arish incident. Egyptian security forces had taken much flak following the twin attacks on the Copts and now face two new challenges: Easter prayers and, towards month-end, the pope's visit. On Sunday the Vatican announced that Pope Francis' plans to visit Egypt remain unchanged: if anything his arrival is even more important, for the sake of his message of peace. On Tuesday evening, prayers in solidarity with the Copts of Egypt, who are thought to constitute about 10% of the Egyptian population, were held at the Elias Catholic Church on Ein Dor Street in Haifa, Israel. Meanwhile churches in the heavily Coptic city of Minya, for example, canceled Easter celebrations beyond liturgical prayers in mourning for the Palm Sunday deaths With reporting by Reuters.

News article:
Cairo (AFP) - The authorities in Egypt said on Thursday they had identified the second of two jihadist bombers who targeted Coptic Christian Palm Sunday services last week. The interior ministry made the announcement after President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi pledged as he visited Coptic Pope Tawadros II to hunt down the perpetrators of the bombings. The Islamic State group claimed the Sunday attacks, which killed 45 people and followed a December 11 suicide bombing that killed 29 in a Cairo church. Sisi's visit to the papal seat in the capital came a day after the interior ministry identified the bomber who struck outside Saint Mark's church in Alexandria, killing 17 people. Sunday's first bombing at the Mar Girgis church in Tanta, north of Cairo, killed 28 people. Sisi said "state agencies were exerting their utmost effort to chase down the perpetrators of those vile acts," the presidency said in a statement. On Wednesday, the interior ministry identified the perpetrator of the Alexandria attack as Mahmud Hassan Mubarak Abdullah, born in the southern province of Qena in 1986. On Thursday, it said it had now also identified the bomber who blew himself up in the Tanta church. "DNA tests carried out on the family of a fugitive member and the remains of the suicide bomber... made it possible to identify him as Mamduh Amin Mohammed Baghdadi, born in 1977 in Qena province, where he lived," it said. The ministry said he was a member of a "terrorist" cell, and also announced the arrest of three other members of the group. On Wednesday, it also offered a 100,000 pound (about $5,500) reward for information leading to the arrest of suspects it said belonged to jihadist cells linked to the church attacks. On Thursday, the reward was increased to 500,000 pounds. Sisi declared a three-month state of emergency after the bombings and called in the army to protect "vital" installations around the country. The Coptic Church said on Wednesday it would cut back Easter celebrations to a single mass after the bombings. The violence came ahead of Catholic Pope Francis's first visit to Egypt, which a Vatican official said will go ahead as planned on April 28 and 29 despite the attacks.

News article:
One person has been killed and at least four people have been injured in an attack in southern Sinai. Responsibility for the attack, near Egypt's St. Catherine's Monastery, has been claimed by the "Islamic State." Egyptian officials have reported that a gunman attacked a police checkpoint on Tuesday evening, killing one officer and wounding four people. The attack occurred near the St. Catherine's Monastery in southern Sinai (pictured), a UNESCO heritage site that is one of the oldest Christian monasteries in the world. Shortly after the shooting occurred, the so-called "Islamic State" (IS) claimed responsibility through their Amaq news agency. Minority under attack The incident comes just over a week after two churches in Egypt were bombed during Palm Sunday services, killing 45 people. The bombings were claimed by an IS affiliate based on the Sinai Peninsula. The country's Christian minority, which makes up about 10 percent of the total population, has become a frequent target of militants over the past several months. Pope Francis is planning to visit Egypt at the end of April. blc/cmk (AP, Reuters, AFP)

News article:
* Any views expressed in this article are those of the author and not of Thomson Reuters Foundation. (Beirut) – Egyptian military forces in the northern Sinai Peninsula executed at least two and as many as eight unarmed detainees and covered up the killings to make it appear that the victims were armed "terrorists" shot to death in a raid, Human Rights Watch said today. Video of the killings aired by an opposition television channel based in Turkey on April 20, 2017, appears to show a man in a camouflage uniform executing the two men, one after the other, with an assault rifle. Two Sinai sources identified the executioner as a well-known member of a local militia that works at the behest of the Egyptian military. The video also appears to show a member of Egypt's military intelligence service observing and directing the first execution and that the soldiers used Humvee vehicles supplied by the United States to transport the detainees. Other videos and photographs Human Rights Watch reviewed corroborate the incident. Launch Gallery "These outrageous killings confirm that Egypt's counterterrorism campaign in the Sinai is out of control," said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. "Egypt's allies cannot claim ignorance about these deadly abuses." Countries that provide weapons, materiel, or training to the Egyptian military should suspend all such assistance as long as the Egyptian armed forces remain responsible for widespread and serious violation of human rights, Human Rights Watch said. International law obliges Egypt to apprehend and prosecute the men responsible for the killings. Sinai News 24, an independent Facebook page that tracks events in the Sinai Peninsula, reported that the two victims were brothers from the Rumailat clan – Daoud Sabri al-Awabdah, 16, and Abd al-Hadi Sabri al-Awabdah, 19 – whom the army had arrested in the town of Rafah and forcibly disappeared on July 18, 2016. In the execution video, the militia member is shown briefly interrogating the second victim about his family and confirming that he is a member of the Rumailat before he and another soldier execute him. Human Rights Watch was not able to immediately confirm the location or date of the killings, but the video appeared to be authentic. Human Rights Watch reviewed an original version of the execution video and a separate video, posted on a pro-government Facebook page on November 20, 2016, that appears to show the same eight bodies seen in the execution video lined up next to a building that also appears in the execution video. In the second video, six soldiers stand next to the line of bodies. "This is the revenge for those who died," one says. In a photograph of the same scene obtained by Human Rights Watch, one of the soldiers can be seen lifting the head of one of the bodies by the hair as he looks at the camera. In a third video of the scene, also posted on the same pro-government Facebook page, a man can be heard saying, "Should I change the position of the gun?" The man who is filming the body replies, "Finish, finish." In addition, two bodies that appear in the execution video were also shown in official media releases published by the Egyptian armed forces on November 5 and December 6, 2016. In the December release, the armed forces spokesman described the operation that led to the victims' death as "law enforcement forces" continuing to "tighten their security grip in the areas of countering terrorist activities in North Sinai, where they managed to eliminate eight armed terrorist elements." A representative for Mekameleen, the channel that obtained the execution video, told Human Rights Watch that according to their information, the incident took place sometime in October or November in al-Tuma, a village south of Sheikh Zuweid, a town where Egyptian forces have repeatedly fought elements of the extremist group Islamic State (also known as ISIS). Residents of al-Tuma had previously abandoned the village due to the fighting, North Sinai residents told Human Rights Watch. Two North Sinai sources told Human Rights Watch that the man seen executing both victims is a member of a local militia, colloquially called Group 103, which was formed by the Egyptian military in 2015 to assist in Sinai operations and which the military arms and oversees. The second source knew the man's identity because they previously lived near each other in Sheikh Zuweid. Three other sources – the Mekameleen representative, an expert on Sinai affairs in Egypt, and an independent Sinai group – all independently identified the same man to Human Rights Watch. In the execution video, the militia member appears to be wearing an Egyptian army infantry patch on his shoulder. A second man in the video appears to be wearing a patch of the armed forces' Military Intelligence and Reconnaissance Department. During the first execution, the intelligence officer stands mostly off screen to the right of the camera holding a mobile phone, and a voice can be heard directing the militia member: "Not just the head. Not just the head. Enough." Soldiers can be seen placing and removing their assault rifles next to at least two of the eight bodies, apparently so that the bodies could be falsely photographed with weapons. Since the military removed former President Mohamed Morsy in July 2013, violence has significantly increased in North Sinai, an underdeveloped and long-marginalized governorate that borders Israel and Gaza. The extremist group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, which pledged allegiance to ISIS and renamed itself Sinai Province in November 2014, has established a stronghold in the area and waged a series of attacks on Egyptian police and armed forces there, in addition to targeting Christians and suspected collaborators. Since 2013, North Sinai has experienced at least 1,500 armed attacks, which have killed dozens of civilians and hundreds of members of the security forces, according to the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. In response, Egypt has deployed more forces to the Sinai than at any time since the country's 1973 war with Israel. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who as defense minister orchestrated Morsy's ouster, has repeatedly stated that Egypt is in a "state of war" and compared recent operations to the previous conflicts with Israel, in 1973 and 1967. The counterterrorism campaign in North Sinai has been rife with abuses. Between July 2013 and August 2015, Egyptian authorities destroyed around half of the town of Rafah, on the border with the Gaza Strip, evicting thousands of families and demolishing at least 3,255 buildings. Dozens of families Human Rights Watch interviewed in 2016 and 2017 reported numerous arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings by Egyptian military and Interior Ministry forces. In January 2017, Interior Ministry counterterrorism troops most likely executed at least four and as many as 10 North Sinai men whom they had previously arrested. The Interior Ministry then apparently staged a fake raid to cover up the incident. The killings shown in the video that surfaced on April 20 fit a pattern described by several North Sinai residents. At least two detainees formerly held by the army told Human Rights Watch that their guards would come at dawn, summon certain detainees, and take them away without telling them where they were going. These detainees did not return, said the former prisoners, who said they believed the men had been executed. In one of two such cases in November 2014 that Human Rights Watch documented, the detainee discovered after his release that one of the men taken away by guards had been killed the same day. The man's family found his body later in a deserted area. Several North Sinai residents have told Human Rights Watch that when the army conducts regular arrest sweeps in villages, troops are usually accompanied by one or more militia members, sometimes referred to as "collaborators," who play a leading role in identifying and arresting suspects. Other residents said that these individuals have threatened them or had their relatives arrested due to personal or business disputes. Residents said that military "collaborators" have falsely identified numerous individuals as "terrorists," leading army troops to arrest them. One former resident of Sheikh Zuweid said that members of these militias live in or next to the Zohor army barracks in Sheikh Zuweid. The army forcibly evicted residents of many buildings surrounding the base and allowed militia members to occupy them, this person said. If the fighting in North Sinai has risen to the level of an "armed conflict" under international law, the conduct of both sides would be regulated by international humanitarian law, also known as the laws of war. The willful killing of a civilian or prisoner of war constitutes a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions, which would be a further obligation on Egypt to arrest and prosecute those responsible.

Israeli soldiers abducted, on Friday evening, one Palestinian child, and injured another, after the army invaded Ni’lin village, near Ramallah, while chasing protesters. Media sources in Ramallah said the soldiers abducted Jamal al-Khawaja, 15, and shot another child with a rubber-coated steel bullet. The attack took place after the soldiers assaulted Palestinians protesting near the main entrance of Ni’lin village, in solidarity with the ongoing hunger strike of the Palestinian detainees since April 17th. The Palestinians closed road #445, which leads to many illegal Israeli colonies, built on privately-owned Palestinian lands. Also on Friday, the soldiers invaded Beit Ummar town, north of the southern West Bank city of Hebron, and abducted Hasan Mohammad Sabouna, 17, while standing in front of his home.

Years ago Rav Meir Kahane used to begin his lecture tour with the following opening statement: “Anyone who has witnessed the events since 1948 and does not see the Hand of G-d, is not a non-believer, is not a scoffer, he is blind!” This quote has been stuck in my mind this Yom Haatzmaut as Israel celebrates its 69th birthday. The accomplishments of this little country in such a relatively short amount of time, is nothing less than miraculous. I was privileged to hear Rav Shmuel Eliyahu, the chief rabbi of Tzfat rattle off these miracles in the context of prophecies made over 2500 years ago. Some of his observations: -The Jewish population in 1800 was only 7000 and in 1920, roughly 50,000. By 1948, the population rose to 650,000 and in 2017, nearly 6,500,000. -There is a prophecy regarding the widening of the roads to Jerusalem. Our transport minister, Yisrael Katz, told Rav Eliyahu that his purpose in building a Tel Aviv-Jerusalem speed train, and the widening of the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway, is in preparation of the building of the Beit Hamikdash. -Israel is considered the eighth superpower in the world militarily, when we had only a makeshift army in 1948. -According to Rav Eliyahu, the birth rate of Jewish women has surpassed that of Arab women, when once the average for the Arabs was 9.1. -The number of countries desiring to have diplomatic relations has been rapidly increasing, where the nations of the world want to glean from Israel’s wisdom and technological advances. -A final point that is so significant is that the growth of the State of Israel, proves that G-d has not rejected the Jewish people. On the contrary, Israel is the number one reason for the huge increase in non-Jews flooding our Jewish courts seeking conversion. As a rabbi, it has become easier to prove G-d’s existence, by simply pointing to our modern day miracles. Indeed, anyone who doesn’t see the Hand of G-d that we are witnessing today, has to be blind. We must give thanks to Hashem that we have merited seeing the fulfillment of these prophecies in our lifetime. Chag Atzmaut Sameach!

News article:
AMSTERDAM (JTA) — Shortly after the outbreak of the Six-Day War in 1967, Ronny Naftaniel was soliciting donations on the street and putting a lot of money into a box emblazoned with the words “for Israel.” An Amsterdam Jew who was 19 that year, Naftaniel was one of many pro-Israel activists across Western Europe who collected the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of dollars from individuals supportive of Israel in its fight against Arab neighbors who were widely perceived as the more powerful aggressors. In Holland especially, the war triggered a popular mobilization by ordinary citizens that featured massive blood drives, group prayers at churches, solidarity rallies and a bumper sticker campaign that was so successful that for a time it rendered ubiquitous the slogan “I stand behind Israel.” Dutch corporations and trade unions mobilized their members to raise millions for Israel. “There was a genuine anxiety in society for Israel’s fate and relief when it prevailed,” recalled Naftaniel, the longtime head of the Hague-based Center for Information and Documentation on Israel until his retirement in 2012. “Both led to extraordinary affection and goodwill, also in the media. It was universal and unifying.” Today, however, Israel is a divisive issue in the Netherlands and across Western Europe, where the mainstream media occasionally question Israel’s very right to exist amid criticism over its perceived occupation of Palestinian land captured in 1967. On the street, expressions of solidarity with Israel often invite attacks by pro-Palestinian Muslims and the left, and are dwarfed by mass demonstrations against Israel that regularly feature anti-Semitic chants. Meanwhile, the continent’s east has made the opposite journey: Whereas in 1967 merely mentioning Israel could lead to imprisonment, the Jewish state is now widely cherished in Eastern Europe and Russia as an ally and model for success. These profound shifts, which may affect the future of European Jewry, are rooted in changes far wider than merely how certain societies view the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Indeed, they reflect dramatic developments in the value systems, demographics and economies both of Israel and of the continent to which it has strong cultural ties. Ervin Kohn, the leader of the Jewish community of Norway, was preparing for his bar mitzvah when the Six-Day War broke out. “In my family we were deeply worried about Israel’s future before and during the war, and this anxiety was something shared across Norwegian society,” he said. “Today, it would be different.” Last week, Norway’s largest workers union escalated its anti-Israel rhetoric to include a call for a total boycott of the country. And in Holland, where trade unions in 1967 donated millions to Israel’s defense, members of the Dutch Federation of Trade Unions in January debated boycotting Israel during a workshop (no decision was made and the federation has no policy of boycotting Israel). Meanwhile, pro-Palestinian demonstrators regularly hold rallies calling for a boycott of Israel opposite the main entrance of the Bijenkorf department store in Amsterdam, which in 1967 collected funds for Israel. Radical changes also happened in Sweden, where Israel was so popular in the 1960s that it was a preferred destination for thousands of volunteers to kibbutzim and for decades to come. Last year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Sweden is “not a noted friend of Israel” after its foreign minister, Margot Wallstrom, blamed Israel for “executing” Palestinians who tried to kill Israelis and accused Israel of motivating terrorist attacks in Europe. Kohn traces the change in attitude on Israel primarily to how “Israeli governments were dragging their feet” in reaching a peace agreement with the Palestinians, he said. Kohn advocates applying equal pressure on Israel and the Palestinians to make peace, but in Norway Israel is “not perceived as having done what they could to fulfill the Palestinian national aspirations,” he added. Across Western Europe, activists critical of Israel have called the Jewish state on its treatment of Palestinians, including in exhibitions held in churches about the detention of children, alleged torture and the slaying of civilians during rounds of fighting with Palestinian and other terrorist groups. But the Dutch chief rabbi, Binyomin Jacobs, who was 18 in 1967, sees the changing attitudes to Israel as owing also to demographic changes inside Western Europe that have little to do with Israel. The increase in anti-Israel and anti-Semitic sentiment in Western Europe cannot be understood, Jacobs argued, without taking into account the arrival there since the 1970s of millions of Muslim Arabs and Turks. “The people who riot at anti-Israel rallies, who throw firebombs on houses with Israeli flags, who chant ‘Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas’ on the street, they do not act out of frustration with this or that policy,” he told JTA. “They are often immigrants from Muslim countries where anti-Israel sentiment and anti-Semitism is just a normal part of upbringing.” In 2014, demonstrators at an anti-Israel demonstration in Belgium shouted about killing Jews in Antwerp. The Hague in the Netherlands, France, Germany and many other places saw other anti-Israel events. That year, as Israel was fighting Hamas in Gaza, a woman who flew an Israeli flag in her Amsterdam home had firebombs hurled at her balcony. Nine synagogues in France were also attacked during hostilities. While public attitudes toward Israel have soured in Western Europe, they have improved beyond recognition in the formerly communist east, according to Jehoshua Raskin, a Chabad rabbi who works in Russia and was born in 1948 in Nizhny Novgorod east of Moscow. Raskin and his mother were called traitors by KGB officers who threatened to have them jailed in 1967 over the Raskins’ request to leave Russia for Israel. “Now Israel, which was demonized during communism as an archenemy of ‘our Arab brothers’ and as a capitalist villain, is synonymous with success in Russia,” said Raskin, who was 18 when the war hit. Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu celebrated 25 years of diplomatic relations at a a festive event at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. Upon his arrival in the Russian capital, Netanyahu was greeted with a red carpet and marching band. His wife, Sara, was given pink flowers. “We have a solid foundation of trust and understanding to rely on as we make plans for the future,” Putin said during the visit. Under Putin, “Jewish communities that once distanced themselves from anything Israeli to stay safe are now celebrating cultural events with Israeli flags,” said Chaim Chesler, founder of Limmud FSU, a Jewish educational group that has been working in the former Soviet Union since 1992. Soviet hostility to Israel also has made Israel popular with enemies of Russia across Eastern Europe, Chesler said. The same applies to Finland, added Gideon Bolotowsky, a former leader of that country’s Jewish community. Widespread sympathy for Israel exists to this day in Finland, he added, where pro-Israel rallies organized by Christian supporters of the Jewish state typically dwarf anti-Israel events. “You have to remember that in comparison to other European countries, Finland has very few Muslims,” Bolotowsky noted. (According to a U.S. State Department report from 2016, Finland has 65,000 Muslims, constituting about 1 percent of the population). In Western European countries with larger Muslim populations, hostility toward Israel is being adopted increasingly by politicians seeking Muslim votes. In the Netherlands, the general elections in March saw a radical pro-Islam party win parliament representation for the first time. The party, DENK, supports a blanket boycott of the Jewish state, and its leader last year refused to shake Netanyahu’s hand during a visit to the Hague. And in France, the current leader of the Socialist Party, Benoit Hamon, spoke with surprising candor about the need to factor in Muslim sensibilities in devising a policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In a 2014 interview, Hamon said that supporting the establishment of a Palestinian state was the Socialists’ “best way to recuperate our electorate in the suburbs and the neighborhoods” – code for Muslim voters — “who did not support the pro-Israeli position taken by President Francois Hollande.” In Sweden, Israel was popular in ’67 because it was perceived as the underdog, according to George Braun, the leader of the Jewish community of Gothenburg. “Then, when Israel emerged as a powerful and robust entity, the Palestinians took on that role,” he said. Additionally, “the media in Sweden have become biased against Israel.” Yet Braun says he does not miss the days when Israel was more popular in Sweden. “It was nice to have everyone on your side, of course,” he said, “but I prefer a heavily criticized Israel that is strong and viable than a weak and uncertain one that is universally loved.”

News article:
Israel has done everything that it can to promote a second Arab Palestinian state, except self-destruct. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter It signed the Oslo Accords and withdrew from much of Judea and Samaria, all of the major Arab population centers, and all of the Gaza Strip, removing 9,000 Jewish citizens from their homes. It promotes and funds the Palestinian Authority, despite official PA incitement against Israel and Jews, support for terrorism, and collaboration with Hamas. It was not enough, not even to convince Palestinians to continue negotiations, or stop incitement. And, as PA leaders have made clear, it will never be enough until Israel agrees to all of its conditions. Despite this reality, the international community and even some Israeli politicians insist on “the two-state solution,” as if the dangers posed by a Palestinian state do not exist. Prime Minister Netanyahu and Palestinian President Abbas. Both one-state solution and two-state solution have the same objective: Israel’s demise (Photo: Reuters) Israel is dancing alone. “Our strategy is ‘bottom up,’ assisting Palestinians to build new towns, neighborhoods and infrastructure,” Israeli officials offer. “What’s good for them is good for us.” At least until the music stops. Although some thought that a peaceful settlement was possible when Israel signed the Oslo accords and agreed to Palestinian self-rule, those illusions were shattered by Arab violence and terrorism. After 24 years of failed efforts and delusional policies, and now regional chaos, the Israeli government must consider more realistic alternatives that serve its national interests. Arguing for recognized and defensible borders is important, but begs the larger question: To whom does Judea and Samaria belong? Insisting that Israel remain in these territories primarily for security reasons forfeits the inherent rights of the nation-state of the Jewish people in the Land of Israel. Arab proposals for a “one-state” solution that eliminates Israel is an effective Palestinian strategy. By advocating a more extreme position, the “two-state” option seems more reasonable and acceptable. Both, however, have the same objective: Israel’s demise. Israeli leaders, on the other hand, propose no alternative to a “two-state solution.” At best, they insist on keeping three large settlement blocs and Jerusalem as a united city and retaining control of the Jordan Valley. Not only is this unacceptable to Arab and Palestinian leaders, it is also wildly unrealistic. No Israeli government would consider further withdrawals from Area C in Judea and Samaria. Moreover, core issues, such as eastern Jerusalem, the Temple Mount and the Palestinian “right of return” remain for Arabs “non-negotiable.“ Israel can promote a “solution” that sustains and is consistent with its own vital interests—sovereignty in Judea and Samaria, not only for strategic reasons, but because it is historically, legally and demographically part of the State of Israel. The more Israel clings to plans for a Palestinian state that include most of Judea and Samaria, the more it undermines its legitimate claims and weakens its diplomatic position. An assertion of sovereignty, at least in Area C, in which 450,000 Jews live, along with an estimated 40,000 Arabs, would insure Israel’s vital strategic interests. Arabs living in areas under Israeli control could choose from a variety of options: Apply for Israeli citizenship, or residency; maintain their citizenship in Jordan and/or the Palestinian Authority; or resettle with compensation. Arab refugees and their descendants living under UNRWA’s sponsorship should be offered full citizenship in the countries where they reside. A Palestinian state west of the Jordan River, as late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin insisted, is not an option. Dancing alone may not be as satisfying as it is with someone else, and it can be a liberating experience; but dancing with someone who wants to trip you makes no sense.

President Reuven Rivlin opens Israel’s Jerusalem Day celebrations marking 50 years since the Six Day War and unification of the city. At the official ceremony at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, Rivlin speaks of his memories of the battle for the city, and of the moments he heard the Old City had been secured under Israeli control. “We gave our all for Jerusalem because we knew that on Jerusalem we must insist,” he says. “We will always insist on Jerusalem. There never has been, there never be any other reality. Here, in these stones, beats the heart of the Jewish People. Jerusalem is the heart of the State of Israel, and the Kotel is the heart of Jerusalem.” The ceremony was attended by representatives of the IDF units who led the battle to liberate Jerusalem in 1967, IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot and Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat. Rivlin concluded his address by saying, “On the day of Jerusalem’s liberation, then defense minister Moshe Dayan wrote a note, and slotted it in between the stones of the Kotel: ‘May peace be upon Israel’. Today too, we continue to carry that prayer. May God give, and bring peace over Israel. ‘“Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you who love her,’ Happy Jerusalem Day.”

News article:
Visiting with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem yesterday, President Trump shared a key insight. He noted that “Peace can never take root in an environment where violence is tolerated, funded and even rewarded.” As Trump seeks to end a conflict that has resisted the best efforts of each of his predecessors going back to Ronald Reagan, he'd be wise to keep these words in the forefront of his mind. The only way that Trump can succeed where these others have failed is if he identifies the mistake they’ve made and avoid repeating it. While there’s plenty of blame to go around, there’s one clear lesson that emerges from the decades of failed peace efforts: so long as the Palestinians continue to support terrorism against Israel, they’ll never make the deep compromises that a peace deal requires. From its earliest days, the fundamental premise behind the Israeli-Palestinian peace process was that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was finally ready to put down its guns, give up its dream of destroying Israel, and compromise. The process has failed because this premise has been false. It’s important to remember that American presidents up to and including Jimmy Carter refused to speak to the PLO. They rightly recognized that there was no point in a dialogue with a terrorist organization dedicated to Israel’s destruction. In 1988, President Reagan let it be known that he’d be willing to talk to the PLO if it renounced terror. So PLO leader Yasser Arafat called a press conference and said something that sounded like a renunciation of terror (accounts of what Arafat actually said vary). Reagan opened the promised dialogue. A mere two years later, PLO members attempted to land a raft of armed terrorists on the Tel Aviv beach. When Arafat refused to punish those involved, President George H.W. Bush suspended the dialogue with the PLO. This is one time when Reagan’s sunny optimism could not prevail over a dark reality. As the Oslo Peace Process got underway in 1993, Arafat sent a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Rabin renouncing “the use of terrorism and other acts of violence.” President Clinton enthusiastically joined the peace effort and worked tirelessly to push the parties towards a final deal. Eventually, Clinton persuaded Israeli Prime Minister Barak to offer Arafat a Palestinian State in 97% of the West Bank (with land swaps), half of Jerusalem and Gaza. But Arafat turned the offer down. Instead he began to compete with Hamas to see who could blow up more Israelis in a wave of terrorism that killed over 1,000 and maimed over 3,000 more. President Clinton realized too late that Arafat was no partner for peace. President George W. Bush tried to learn from Clinton’s mistakes. He rightly recognized that Palestinian terrorism was the primary obstacle to a peace deal. And he correctly identified Arafat as an unrepentant terrorist. So Bush began his 2002 peace effort – the Roadmap to Peace – by sidelining Arafat and insisting on a new Palestinian partner. The partner he received instead was Arafat’s longtime deputy, Mahmoud Abbas. On the surface, the trade looked like a good one. Abbas wears suits instead of military fatigues. And he sought to stop the violence Arafat had escalated, noting that "the use of arms has been damaging and should end." But like Arafat before him, Abbas renounced terrorism in word without ever doing so in deed. Abbas failed to stop the wave of terrorism against Israel. And Abbas’ own Fatah organization remained an active participant in the attacks. Eventually, the Road Map process broke down. Bush was right about Arafat, but he realized too late that Abbas was no better. In the years that have followed, we’ve all learned a lot more about Abbas. He’s now compiled a long record of inciting his people to terror and honoring terrorists. Even worse, he generously funds terror. In 2016, Abbas’ Palestinian Authority paid out roughly $300 million to Palestinian terrorists and their families. When Trump met Abbas in the White House, he reportedly urged him to stop making these payments. This request set forth the minimum precondition to a serious peace process. But Abbas has thus far refused to comply. If he won’t or can’t do this, then what basis is there to believe that he will make the far deeper and more controversial concessions that a peace deal would demand? From Reagan’s day until yesterday, Palestinian support for terror has been the true test of whether the Palestinian leaders are ready to make peace. President Trump should deal with this issue at the outset, before he stakes his legacy on the notion that Abbas and the PLO are really different this time.

Far-right Israelis celebrate on May 24, 2017 in front of east Jerusalem's Damascus Gate leading into the Old City to mark the 50th anniversary of its capture in the Six-Day War of 1967 Thousands of Israelis marched through east Jerusalem's Old City on Wednesday to commemorate 50 years since the Jewish state seized control of it in the Six-Day War. More than 60,000 people took part in the Jerusalem Day event, culminating in celebrations at the Western Wall, according to police estimates, up from between 30,000 to 40,000 in previous years. The wall is the holiest site where Jews can pray. Singing, dancing and waving blue-and-white Israeli flags, crowds of mainly religious Jews marched through the lanes of Palestinian areas, while some crossed the walled Old City's Jewish Quarter. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said "several hundred" officers were deployed to keep the peace. A few hundred Israeli peace activists held a protest against what they branded the "March of Hatred" going through Arab neighbourhoods. Ari Fuld, an Israeli participant in the anniversary celebrations, carrying a handgun, said it was a "miraculous day" for Jews. "Today we are celebrating the unification of Jerusalem. Before 1967, there was a wall and Jews could not enter any of the gates, let alone pray at the Western Wall." As the chanting Israelis marched through Arab neighbourhoods some of them banged on doors of homes and affixed stickers in Hebrew saying "The land of Israel is all mine". Melech, an 18-year-old who did not want to give his surname, said "when we walk on these streets, no matter if it is a Jewish section or Arab section, for us it is all a holy city." At the end tens of thousands gathered next to the Western Wall, singing and dancing to loud music. Scuffles broke out at the Damascus Gate entrance to the Old City ahead of the march as police dispersed Palestinian protesters demanding an end to the occupation of east Jerusalem. Hossam, a Palestinian teenager who did not want to give his surname, said he wanted to defend the Al-Aqsa mosque compound. The hilltop site in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem is known to Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif, which includes Al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock. Jews call it the Temple Mount after the Jewish temples which stood there in biblical times. The holiest site in Judaism and the third-holiest in Islam, it is central to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and was seized from Jordan in the 1967 war. Jews are allowed to visit but not pray there to avoid provoking tensions, but Palestinians fear Israel will seek to assert further control over the site. "We are here to protect Al-Aqsa. They want to storm Al-Aqsa and we must stop them," Hossam said. Deputy foreign minister Tzipi Hotovely of the right-wing Likud party has called on Jews to go up to the flashpoint plateau as part of the celebrations. Earlier on Wednesday around 10 Jews were arrested for attempting to pray there. Israel seized east Jerusalem during the 1967 war and later annexed it in a move never recognised by the international community. Israel proclaims Jerusalem as its united capital, while the Palestinians claim the city's eastern part as the capital of their future state.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition leader Isaac Herzog went head-to-head in the Knesset on Wednesday over Jerusalem, with the premier saying Palestinian refusal to recognize the Jewish state and its capital in any borders is the root of the conflict, and pledging that the city, including the Temple Mount and Western Wall, will forever remain under Israeli sovereignty. A day after US President Donald Trump concluded a 28-hour visit to Jerusalem, the prime minister vowed the city would not be divided again. During a plenum session marking the passage of 50 years since the Six Day War and the reunification of the city’s western and eastern halves, Netanyahu pointed to the US president’s visit to the Western Wall as having “destroyed UNESCO’s propaganda and lies,” referring to a series of resolutions by the UN cultural body that ignored Jewish ties to the city and Israeli sovereignty. Herzog, meanwhile, implored Netanyahu to seize a “historic” opportunity for peace and downplayed the importance of moving the US embassy to the city, which was a campaign promise made by Trump. “We liberated Jerusalem, we made it one city, imperfect but whole,” Netanyahu told lawmakers, at a session also attended by President Reuven Rivlin and Chief Supreme Court Justice Miriam Naor. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Before the Jews came to the city, there was “nearly nothing” in it; it was “forsaken and in constant crisis,” the prime minister said. During the 19 years between 1948 and 1967, the city again reached “a low,” he added. “We will never return to that situation” of the city divided, he pledged. “The Temple Mount and the Western Wall will forever remain under Israeli sovereignty,” he later added. Israel captured the Temple Mount — the holiest site for Jews — and the rest of the Old City and East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967, and extended sovereignty there, but it left administrative authority atop the Mount in the hands of the Jordanian Waqf (Muslim trust), and instituted a status quo agreement that sees Jews permitted to visit but not pray there. The Temple Mount is one of the issues at the heart of tension between Israel and the Palestinians, with the latter frequently accusing Israel of changing or planning to change the existing arrangements — which Israel firmly denies. Advertisement After the prime minister concluded his remarks, Herzog took to the podium, delivering a speech in which he called on Israel to separate the Arab neighborhoods from Jerusalem, urged Netanyahu to seize Trump’s peace offers, and promised to back the prime minister in the “brave, historic” process. Herzog said Trump came with the message that “the region is ready for peace, the region wants peace.” “Mr. Prime Minister, this is the time to go to a brave and historic process to separate from the Palestinians and the implementation of the vision of two states for two peoples. This is the time, 50 years on from the Six Day War, to shake off the heavy burden of millions of Palestinians and ensure the continued existence of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state and homeland of the Jewish people for generations,” he said, vowing his party’s political support for peace talks. “This is the time for leadership, not defeatism, the time to lead and not be led,” he said. “I urge you, Prime Minister, not to miss the opportunity,” Herzog added. “Don’t allow your name to go down in the history books of the State of Israel as the prime minister who missed the greatest opportunity that Israel has known to avoid 50 more years of tears and bereavement.” He also took a dig at efforts to relocate the US embassy to Jerusalem, saying the city was desperate for other social and economic reforms and citing poverty and the rapidly growing Arab population threatening to eclipse its Jewish population. Advertisement “Therefore, will all due respect, it is not the US embassy that is the more important thing the city is lacking, but rather tools and resources and significant decisions on changing directions,” he said. Following Herzog’s speech, the prime minister addressed the plenum again, emphasizing that moving all embassies — but specifically the US embassy — to Jerusalem was “not a trivial matter.” “The current situation is absurd,” Netanyahu said, referring to the fact that nearly all international embassies are in Tel Aviv. The prime minister also defended his comparison of the Manchester bomber to Palestinian terrorists in his response to the deadly attack on Tuesday. He had said that had the attacker been Palestinian, he would have received a stipend by the Palestinian Authority. “The root of the matter is the stubborn, violent refusal of the Palestinian side to accept the Jewish state — and the capital of the Jews — in any borders,” he said. “Everything else is interesting, important, and certainly open for discussion and dialogue. These are the basic facts.” Herzog then returned to the plenum again, reiterating his call for peace talks, before the session was dispersed. The sparring came a day after Trump, in his visit, stressed a unique opportunity for Israel to make peace with the Palestinians and Arab world. While he met with PA President Mahmoud Abbas, the US president made no mention of Palestinian statehood or the US embassy move during his visit.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tells Knesset members the Western Wall and the Temple Mount will “forever remain under Israeli sovereignty.” The prime minister addresses the Knesset plenum on 50th annual celebrations of Jerusalem Day, which marks Israel’s reunification of the city in the 1967 Six Day War. He says the capture of the Jerusalem holy site corrected “a historic injustice” and the “achievement of brave fighters 50 years ago will remain forever.” Netanyahu also says it’s “absurd” that many countries choose to have their embassies in Tel Aviv instead of Jerusalem.

News article:
Israel on Wednesday celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the reunification of its capital city, Jerusalem. Jerusalem was secured by Israeli forces on June 7, 1967, corresponding to the 28th day of the Jewish month of Iyar, after two days of fighting with Jordan. In an account of the battle to retake Jerusalem, journalist Abraham Rabinovich wrote that when the Six Day War first broke out with Egypt, Israel had sent a message to Jordan’s King Hussein asking him not to join the fighting. But Hussein, who had entered into a defense pact with Egypt, instead chose to put his forces under the command of an Egyptian general. Although Jordanian forces began firing against Israeli positions, Israel did not attack Jordan until Jordanian forces broke into Israeli-held western Jerusalem and that Radio Cairo reported that Mount Scopus — which remained in Israeli hands after the 1948 War of Independence — was captured. While the report turned out to be false, it was seen by Israel as an expression of Egypt’s intent. After two days of fighting, Israeli troops surrounded the Old City of Jerusalem, the last Arab position in the city. At 9 AM the following morning, the Israeli cabinet approved an operation to retake the Old City. Israeli forces entered through the Lion’s Gate and made their way to the Temple Mount, facing little resistance. After this historic victory, Israel’s Defense Minister Moshe Dayan said: This morning, the Israel Defense Forces liberated Jerusalem. We have united Jerusalem, the divided capital of Israel. We have returned to the holiest of our holy places, never to part from it again. To our Arab neighbors we extend, also at this hour – and with added emphasis at this hour – our hand in peace. And to our Christian and Muslim fellow citizens, we solemnly promise full religious freedom and rights. We did not come to Jerusalem for the sake of other peoples’ holy places, and not to interfere with the adherents of other faiths, but in order to safeguard its entirety, and to live there together with others, in unity. When the Jordanian army first captured the Old City of Jerusalem in May 1948, they expelled all of its Jewish inhabitants, contrary to the dictates of international law. From 1948 to 1967, Jordan destroyed over 50 ancient synagogues in the Old City, destroyed ancient Jewish graves on the Mount of Olives, and refused to allow Jews to visit their holy sites, many of which were desecrated. Jordan also imposed restrictions on the city’s Christian population, including by controlling the materials taught in Christian schools and forbidding Christian charities and religious institutions from purchasing property.

During a celebration for Jerusalem Day at the Israeli Knesset, marking the 50th anniversary of the capital city’s reunification, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed the Temple Mount and Western Wall would remain under Israeli sovereignty. “The black cloud over Jerusalem disappeared 50 years ago,” said Netanyahu. “The Temple Mount and Western Wall will stay under Israeli sovereignty forever.” The prime minister lauded the freedom of religion practiced in Jerusalem “only under our (Israeli) control.” From 1948-1967, Jordan controlled eastern Jerusalem. Netanyahu also linked Jerusalem Day with this week’s terror attack in Manchester, U.K., which killed 22 people and injured as many as 59 during an Ariana Grande concert. “Had the victims of the Manchester attack been killed in Jerusalem, the terrorist’s family would have received a big stipend from the Palestinian Authority,” he said, referring to an ongoing Palestinian Authority practice that Israel and the U.S. have sought to end. “You cannot say that the despicable act in Manchester is forbidden, but that here in Jerusalem it is allowed,” said Netanyahu.

News article:
Phil Bloom was on the first plane of volunteers from South Africa that landed in Israel before the 1967 Six-Day War. They arrived on June 4, a day before the war broke out, and were immediately dispatched to Kibbutz Ma’ayan Baruch, in the north of the country. They were assigned to work in the fields, replacing members of the cooperative community who had been called up for military duty. At the time, Bloom was in the middle of his second year of psychology studies at the University of Cape Town. He was active in Habonim, a Zionist youth movement affiliated with Israel’s Labor Party. While growing up in Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia), he recounts, he had dreamed of living in Israel one day. But it took four months of volunteering on a kibbutz to make that dream a reality. “Once I was able to overcome the hurdle of Hebrew, I had the conviction to stay,” he says. No regrets Bloom did not return to South Africa to complete his studies. Instead, he transferred to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he earned his degrees. After raising a family in Jerusalem, where he practiced psychology for many years, he now lives in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Hasharon. Asked if he has any regrets about his decision to leave everything behind at the age of 22 and throw in his lot with the struggling Jewish state, Bloom responds: “Only that I didn’t do it earlier.” Open gallery view Phil Bloom, then and now. Credit: Courtesy Miri Gold, originally from Detroit, did not spend the Six-Day War in Israel, but she was there a year before, as a high school senior. She returned two years later, doing her junior year of the University of Michigan at Hebrew University. Her experiences on those formative trips explain her decision to return for the long haul several years later, as a founding members of Kibbutz Gezer, in central Israel. Looking back with somewhat jaded eyes, she recalls an excitement during those period that was almost contagious. “All the schmaltz got to me as well,” she says. Gold moved to Israel together with a group of friends from Habonim, who were offered accommodations on a kibbutz in the Golan Heights. “We were all liberal Jews, left of center in our political views, and we did not want to live in territory captured during the war,” she recalls, “so we turned down the offer.” Victory for religious pluralism Gold made history decades later when, after being ordained as a Reform rabbi, she took the state to court for not paying her a salary, as it did Orthodox rabbis. In a landmark ruling celebrated by advocates of Jewish pluralism in Israel and abroad, the Supreme Court forced the state to pay not only her salary but also those of additional non-Orthodox rabbis employed around the country outside of major cities. Bloom and Gold were part of an unprecedented wave of immigrants from English-speaking countries, largely young Jewish women and men in their 20s, who moved to Israel after the Six-Day War, swept up in the euphoria that followed the country’s lightning victory. Some came with definite plans to settle in Israel, but many arrived as kibbutz volunteers and simply stayed on. Some grew up in Zionist homes, but many others only discovered their connection to Israel when the young Jewish state was threatened with destruction. Today, they are in their late 60s and early 70s, more often than not grandparents, who have since learned all too well that war can also be a sobering experience. An elite group According to Prof. Chaim Waxman, an Israeli-based sociologist with a special interest in American immigrants in Israel, 1969, 1970 and 1971 were record years for immigration from the United States. In this three-year period, nearly 20,000 American Jews moved to Israel. The yearly average was 6,500, compared to an average of 2,000 to 3,000 U.S. immigrants in a typical year. “It was an elite group that came then,” says Waxman, who explored the post-1967 immigration wave in his book “American Aliya: Portrait of an Innovative Migration Movement.” “Most of them were highly educated, the majority were not Orthodox and most were left-leaning supporters of the Democratic Party.” Many of these new immigrants, he notes, who made significant economic and professional sacrifices to move to Israel, were inspired by the idealism that prevailed in the 1960s. “They wanted to be pioneers and saw an opportunity to create a whole new society in Israel,” says Waxman, who is the chairman of the department of behavioral sciences at Hadassah Academic College in Jerusalem. “They felt they had more opportunities to effect change in Israel than they did in the United States.” More than any other event in Israeli history, he says, the Six-Day War had a profound impact on American Jews. “It was an amazing time, Israel was the big hero, and suddenly people who never thought of themselves as Jewish were crawling out of the woodwork.” The transition to living in Israel, however, often proved difficult, and many grew disillusioned. “I would ‘guesstimate’ that until the late 1980s, anywhere between 25 and 30 percent, and even maybe close to 40 percent, of those who came to Israel ultimately left,” says Waxman. “The rate of return has been much lower since the 1990s, mainly because life in Israel, at least in economic terms, has become easier and a much larger share of the immigrants from the United States are Orthodox Jews, who tend to be more motivated.” The Six-Day War caught Joe Romanelli in Costa Rica, where he was serving a stint as a budding American diplomat. Romanelli, who was born in Cleveland and grew up in Brooklyn, joined the U.S. Foreign Service after he graduated from Columbia University. “When the Six-Day War broke out, I panicked,” he recounts. “I kept thinking what would happen if Israel lost the war. It started me out on a whole process of thinking about my connection to the country.” On his first trip to Israel, two years later, Romanelli decided to quit the Foreign Service and relocate permanently. “I came to the conclusion that what Israel needed for its survival more than anything else was people, and if that’s the case, I should make aliyah.” Privileged to help His first job in Israel was assistant to the spokesman of the aliyah department of the Jewish Agency, where he was responsible for the foreign press. After that, he was promoted to director of the organization’s North American aliyah desk. “I consider it a privilege that I was able to have a career that allowed me to help others make aliyah,” Romanelli says. Open gallery view Joe Romanelli after moving to Israel. Credit: Courtesy Sydney Shapiro, another young Jew who was inspired to move to Israel because of the 1967 war, also dedicated his life to promoting aliyah. Shapiro, who from a very young age had been active in the religious Zionist Bnei Akiva movement in his hometown of Cape Town, South Africa, says that settling in Israel had always been his goal. “The Six-Day War is what clinched the deal for me,” he says. Shapiro arrived on the first plane of volunteers out of South Africa after the war. Upon landing, he was sent with friends from Bnei Akiva to Shluchot, a religious kibbutz in the Beit She’an Valley. After volunteering there for a few months, he returned to South Africa, where he worked for the Zionist Federation for a few years before coming back to Israel permanently in early 1970. He spent most of his career since as an executive at Telfed-South African Zionist Federation (Israel), the association of South African immigrants in Israel, serving as the organization’s director for 30 years. During the few months he spent in Israel following the 1967 war, he says, one particular experience stands out. “It was around the time of Tisha B’Av,” Shapiro says, referring to the Jewish fast day that commemorates the destruction of both the first and second temples, “and we were on our first trip to the Old City after Jerusalem was unified. I remember us asking ourselves whether it was still necessary to fast on this day, now that the Jewish holy sites were under Israel’s control.” Grateful to contribute Open gallery view Sydney Shapiro, then (left, in gray swim trunks) and now. Credit: Courtesy He has absolutely no regrets. “I’ve never thought of going back to South Africa in all my years here,” says Shapiro, who lives with his family in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ra’anana. “Many of my friends are pessimists about Israel, but not me. Maybe it’s because I’m a dreamer and I feel grateful to have been part of what happened here and to have contributed to it.” Romanelli, too, says he does not have second thoughts about his decision. Although leaving his family behind in the United States was difficult, he says, his only big regret after all these years is that one of his two sons ended up leaving Israel for a high-tech job in Atlanta. Gold is somewhat less upbeat. Leaving Israel was never an option she considered, she says, but as Israeli society has verged more to the right politically and religiously, she finds it difficult to celebrate certain national holidays, as she once did. “I always think of the other side, and that makes it harder,” she says. The disastrous occupation Did Israel turn out the way that Bloom expected? “Look,” he says, “I am not at all happy with how we failed to find a solution to the 50-year-old problem of the territories, and it is pretty disastrous to the country that this problem hasn’t been solved.” Because of the occupation, he adds, “there’s been an erosion of Zionism and democracy and of moral standards in this country, and that’s a tremendous price to pay for not solving the problem.” Yet Bloom does not believe all hope is lost. “I have a kind of optimism that we’re going to get over this,” he says. “The solution isn’t for people to leave the country — and I would never think of doing that or want my children to — but rather, for like-minded people to get together and do something about it.” Going with the flow Norman Slepkov, from a small Canadian town near Niagara Falls, was 19 when he came to Israel for the first time. He arrived a few days after the 1967 war ended, to attend a yearlong young leadership program. That year stretched into nearly 50. He did go back, as planned, when the program ended, but not for long. “I missed Israel and felt it was my home,” he says. So instead of attending art school in North America, as he had originally intended, Slepkov enrolled at Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, in Jerusalem. Since then, he has enjoyed a varied career as an artist, graphic designer and restaurateur. “It wasn’t my plan to remain in Israel for good. Things just happened,” Slepkov says.

When it comes to winning the argument against the BDS movement, the strategy may be as simple as a pan of shakshuka, a Mizrahi album, and a real or virtual tour through Jerusalem. A celebration of culture and a walk through the history of Israel may not be enough to win over the hardcore anti-Zionist proponents of BDS, as their convictions are rooted in the belief that the Jewish people aren’t entitled to their state or protection. In their view, Jews are mere occupiers in David’s kingdom, and Fatah and Hamas are entitled to sweep from the river to the sea. But a campaign that extols the beauty, diversity and goodness of Israel can be a more persuasive voice than the pro-BDS arguments whispered in the ears of those who haven’t decided where they fall on the issue. The strength of such a strategy was illuminated on Jerusalem Day this week at Congregation B’nai Tzedek in Potomac, Md., through moving testimonials of the Six-Day War, homemade Israeli treats, and choruses of “Jerusalem of Gold,” “Haktivah” and other songs that drew the crowd together in pride and passion. Heidi Krizer Daroff, North America director of the Israel Forever Foundation, one of the evening’s sponsors, told me her organization’s mission of bringing people from all walks of life closer to the texture, tastes and timelessness of Israel rises above politics, bringing people who may have fond memories of Be’er Sheva or Haifa—or those who have never stepped foot in the Holy Land—closer to the Jewish state. Via books, music, film or cuisine, people are “finding Israel through something they already care about,” Daroff said. Whether through the Munich Memory Project, which keeps alive the 11 Israeli athletes murdered at the 1972 Olympics for no reason other than representing the Jewish state, or through live cooking webinars hosted by Israeli chefs, the foundation produces interactive materials for preschoolers, seniors, students, young professionals and families to build and enhance their personal connection to Israel. Blog posts from those who have been to Israel and fallen in love share the experience with curious minds around the globe. Daroff noted this outreach helps open eyes and build a connection with those who “are teetering on BDS—maybe they think that’s a good idea.” “Israel may have some flaws” like any country, she added, “but strives every day to be a better society.” As emphasized during the evening’s program, Jerusalem speaks a universal language that draws all cultures and faiths to the Old City and its 21st-century vibrancy. That’s not to say politics doesn’t creep into a unified anti-BDS message, but like few things in this political climate, support for Israel enjoys a very bipartisan base on Capitol Hill. Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, drew rousing applause when he addressed the Trump administration’s recent reticence to properly name the location of one of Judaism’s holiest sites: “In case any of you had any doubt, the Western Wall, the Kotel, is in Israel.” “Jerusalem will always be and should always be the undivided capital Israel,” Engel said, invoking another highly bipartisan maxim. “Jerusalem is the symbol of the Jewish people,” and the U.S. embassy should be moved to Israel’s capital of Jerusalem, the lawmaker said, earning more appreciation from the audience. “I don’t think we’d be happy if other countries opened their embassy in Chicago,” he said. One shouldn’t expect those considering whether boycotting Israel is a good idea to immediately convert to the same level of policy agreement shared by Congress. First comes fostering respect for the existence of Israel, then introducing the uninitiated to the rich tapestry of the country. Through the sights, sounds and tastes of Israel, onetime doubters can find themselves deep in love with the Jewish state. Bridget Johnson is a senior fellow with the news and public policy group Haym Salomon Center and D.C. bureau chief for PJ Media.

MT. KISCO, New York (JTA) — Michael Steinhardt has poured millions of dollars into ventures for American Jews. But he’s no fan of American Judaism. The hedge-fund billionaire turned mega-philanthropist is best known as the founder of Birthright Israel, the 10-day free trip to Israel for Jewish young adults, for which he was honored as the first Diaspora torch lighter at Israel’s central Independence Day ceremony this year. More recently, alongside his daughter Sara Berman, he’s founded a network of publicly funded Hebrew-language charter schools. His latest endeavor is a natural history museum at Tel Aviv University that will host exhibits on the flora and fauna of Israel and the Middle East. JTA visited Steinhardt at his New York estate, where he spoke about why he thinks American Jewish education needs to change, what to do with the hundreds of thousands of Birthright alumni once they return home, and why he’s not worried about college students who rail against Israel. You’ve spoken a lot about how the American Jewish community needs to promote secular Jewish culture. Is that what you’re trying to do with your network of charter schools? Can that work if the schools are publicly funded and most of the students aren’t Jewish? Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms These are charter schools, and as charter schools they are open to anyone and they have, on average, no more than 50 percent Jewish students in the school. But these schools teach Hebrew in a way that is demonstrably superior to Jewish day schools. Jewish kids in the charter schools will learn a great deal about Israel in these charter schools. The schools fund a trip to Israel and there’s a great deal of emphasis on Israel, Zionism, stuff like that, but zero [on Judaism] as a religion. And you prefer it that way, as an atheist? Advertisement I don’t think you came here to talk about my theology, but it’s temping me to say I truly believe that the time of Jewish history that we have to devote far more energy to is the last 300 years. The last 300 years is the most enlightened — it is when Jews really shined. I would use the word superior, except people blanch when I use that word. But it’s really what I mean: Jews have accomplished so much, so inexplicably out of proportion to their numbers, in these 300 years, and it’s one of the great failures of Jewish education that that’s not focused on at all. Israel is also getting more religious, and you’ve criticized its government and business world. Why do you feel so positively about Israel if it has some of the same flaws you criticize in American Jewry? The modern state of Israel is the Jewish miracle of the 20th century, but it’s the secular part of Israel that’s the miracle. It’s the extraordinary achievement, it’s the technology, the military, the development of a society out of nothing using Zionist ideals, taking people from terrible places and making them Israeli citizens. Israel has become, for me, the substitute for religion. Are you worried that that secular society is not nearly as dominant in Israel as it was 40 years ago? The people I know in Israel are overwhelmingly secular. Tel Aviv University, the natural history museum, are truly modern, secular institutions. I’ve been critical of a few things in Israel, [but] Israel is to me the most moral state on this planet, [even] with the occupation, with the differences between rich and poor, with the other issues… but it’s really an exceptional place. I have a house in Jerusalem and I like Jerusalem a lot, but if you go to Tel Aviv, it’s a phenomenal world. It’s a world unto itself.

They don’t succeed in catching them. The way I dealt with it, and still deal with it, is to create Birthright post-programming. Some organizations that we created seem to be doing OK, such as OneTable [a group that facilitates Shabbat dinners]. There are other organizations that seem to be doing better. But it’s a real issue. There are all sorts of things to deal with. There’s 60 to 70 percent intermarriage rates [among young non-Orthodox American Jews], a falloff in synagogue attendance. There’s all sorts of things like that. There are no easy answers, but the best answer to date is Birthright. I’m tempted to say it has saved a generation. But there are reports that Birthright’s numbers are shrinking. It recently began accepting applicants who attended an organized Israel trip in high school. Why is that? The numbers we’re taking this year will be a record. If you’re saying we used to have huge waiting lists and we don’t anymore, you’re absolutely correct. I think Birthright has almost become a community norm and a large percentage of the age cohort of 18 to 26 go on Birthright. Having trips to Israel has become a popular engagement for the Jewish world and that may be one of the reasons we don’t get the huge excess of waiting lists. I think I’m too old, too ornery to be a believer that 10 days, Birthright, can change your life. You can’t imagine how many people come back and say, ‘This has changed my life.’ But it’s still 10 days, and they’re 18 or 21 or 26. Has it really changed their life? I don’t know.

The more one understands about Israel, the more comfortable one becomes with the politics of the Israeli government. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

There are all sorts of things to deal with. There’s 60 to 70 percent intermarriage rates [among young non-Orthodox American Jews], a falloff in synagogue attendance. There’s all sorts of things like that. There are no easy answers, but the best answer to date is Birthright. I’m tempted to say it has saved a generation. But there are reports that Birthright’s numbers are shrinking. It recently began accepting applicants who attended an organized Israel trip in high school. Why is that? The numbers we’re taking this year will be a record. If you’re saying we used to have huge waiting lists and we don’t anymore, you’re absolutely correct. I think Birthright has almost become a community norm and a large percentage of the age cohort of 18 to 26 go on Birthright. Having trips to Israel has become a popular engagement for the Jewish world and that may be one of the reasons we don’t get the huge excess of waiting lists. I think I’m too old, too ornery to be a believer that 10 days, Birthright, can change your life. You can’t imagine how many people come back and say, ‘This has changed my life.’ But it’s still 10 days, and they’re 18 or 21 or 26. Has it really changed their life? I don’t know. Advertisement Do you see criticism of Israel’s policies as a threat to Birthright’s impact on Jewish college students? You can’t avoid that being part of the message. Israel is a complicated place in a strange part of the world and there are plenty of issues to deal with. There are a substantial number of Jews who believe that Israel should leave the settlements, leave the West Bank. I think most of us understand the occupation for what it is and what it isn’t. The more one understands about Israel, the more comfortable one becomes with the politics of the Israeli government. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Commenting on his proposal that would have Israel annex the West Bank, lawmaker Bezalel Smotrich (Habayit Hayehudi) said he would not give the Palestinians living there the right to vote as part of the plan. There is no place in the world, no perspective or basic assumption that would cause a country to commit suicide, including civil suicide by granting the right to vote, the far-right lawmaker said. Smotrich, who was a panelist on the topic of The Ultimate Deal for Solving the Conflict, responded to critics: You are to decide what democracy is? You are to decide what apartheid is? I will give [the Palestinians] many more rights than what they would have in any of the agreements that anyone would imagine, more than what they have today in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority. Zehava Galon, the chairwoman of the left-wing Meretz party, was highly critical of the organizers of the Haaretz Conference on Peace for inviting Smotrich. What got into your heads to invite a supporter of apartheid and ethnic cleansing? she asked. Referring to the late and virulently anti-Arab founder of the Kach movement, Meir Kahane, Galon remarked: Would you have invited Kahane to appear at the conference? Why? Because it generates traffic and ratings? Someone who was a symbol of extremism yesterday becomes the center tomorrow. Smotrich is a screaming red line. Such people who support ethnic cleansing must not be given legitimacy. It's not purism. We don't legitimize racism. Ever. We need to stand by our principles. Commenting on the right-wing representatives' proposals to resolve the conflict with the Palestinians, Galon said: The right has no solution to the conflict. For close to a decade, Netanyahu has been touting the concept here of managing the conflict, but the conflict is managing him, she said. Even that is preferable to the spectrum of solutions that the government is offering us today, solutions that range between baseless and monstrous, between Bennett's utopian version for Bosnia, which is annexation of the territories, to the new invention from your new friend here, which is annexation of the territories and democracy without the right to vote, from the school of thought of Knesset member Bezalel Smotrich.

News article:
Estimates vary but it is believed that anywhere from 500,000 to one million Israelis live in the United States. For decades, this population was surprisingly silent and inactive on issues related to Israel despite consistent efforts to engage them. In 2007, this began to change when Adam Milstein, Shawn Evenhaim, Danny Alpert, Naty Saidoff, Shoham Nicolet and a few other Israeli-born philanthropists created what is now the Israeli-American Council (IAC). Now, seemingly overnight – though it has taken a decade of organizing – hundreds of thousands of Israeli-Americans have been mobilized to strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship, energize their peers, build coalitions, and educate Americans about their homeland. The catalyst for the creation of an organization occurred in 2006 during the Second Lebanon War when the Consul General in Los Angeles organized a rally to support Israel. Thousands of Jewish Americans came out to show their support, but the Consul noticed only a small number of Israelis participated. He asked Milstein and some other Israeli businesspeople for help. Unlike so many in the Jewish community who spend more time talking than acting, Milstein said these few individuals had the financial means and vision to invest in mobilizing the Israeli community in Los Angeles, and were not interested in wasting time debating how to accomplish their mission. “We had no established action plan,” recalls Milstein, today the Chair of the IAC. “We just jumped into the water and ran things like it was a startup. Our mission was to ensure that future generations of Israeli-Americans had a Jewish and Israeli identity. We wanted to create ambassadors for Israel here in America, to find ways to connect with the broader Jewish community and to create future leaders.” A turning point for the organization, according to Milstein, was when the group decided in 2012 to change its name from the Israeli Leadership Council and shift the focus from primarily an Israeli identification to one of Americans of Israeli descent. “We were shooting ourselves in the foot,” said Milstein. “Israelis said we weren’t really Israelis because we had left our Jewish homeland. Our kids wanted to be Americans. By identifying ourselves as Israeli-Americans we created an identification and purpose that allowed us to feel good about ourselves and support Israel from here.” What makes Israeli-Americans distinctive is their hybrid identity. “We’re proud of our heritage, our land, our language, our values, and our religion,” Milstein relates. “We have a unique identification — Israeliness — that connects us to our Jewish heritage and to Israel.” The stated mission of the IAC “is to build an engaged and united Israeli-American community that strengthens the Israeli and Jewish identity of the next generation, the American Jewish community, and the bond between the peoples of the United States and the State of Israel.” While most American Jewish membership organizations have been shrinking, the IAC has been growing rapidly since its inception. Supported primarily by charitable donations, the group claims 250,000 active participants. One indication of their growth is the size of their national convention, which was first held three years ago with 650 people. Last year, more than 2,000 attended and, in 2017, the group rented the Washington, DC, conventional center in anticipation of a crowd of more than 3,000 Israeli-Americans and their supporters. The transformation from a local Los Angeles-based group to a national organization was fueled by the vision and the underwriting of Dr. Miriam and Sheldon Adelson who promoted IAC’s nationwide expansion in 2013. Today, the IAC has a budget of more than $20 million and a full-time staff of 70 with 15 regional councils based in major cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Boston, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. The IAC also has a 501(c)(4) lobbying arm – the American Israeli Coalition for Action (IAC for Action) – which promotes anti-BDS legislation on the state level and adds an Israeli voice to the lobbying efforts of AIPAC and other pro-Israel organizations educating members of Congress. The IAC is effective because the issues are personal for Israeli-Americans. They can speak about their families back in Israel and their experience in the Israeli army. As immigrants, they are also natural coalition partners with other immigrant communities. Advertisement Given the cliché of two Jews, three opinions, four synagogues and five political parties, I asked Milstein how it was possible to get Israelis to work together. “It isn’t perfect,” he replied, but we stick to the consensus and don’t take positions on Israeli policy. We support the democratically elected government and trust our brothers and sisters in Israel to determine their leaders and the policies they should pursue.” Simultaneously, Milstein says, “we don’t compromise regarding support for Israel.” The group remains bipartisan on both American and Israeli policy and focuses on the shared political and cultural heritage of the two peoples. To accomplish its mission, the IAC has an astounding array of projects. These include: Keshet and Keshet Sfarim: A Hebrew-learning community for families with children 12 and under, which is designed to cultivate a connection to Israel, its culture and Jewish values through the Hebrew language by providing children’s books by Israeli authors. Eitanim: A leadership and entrepreneurship program led by Israeli mentors that brings together Israeli and Jewish American teenagers for weeklong innovation seminars. Mishelanu: A pro-Israel campus program designed to strengthen Israeli and Jewish identity through culture, language, and networking. Shishi Israeli: A program for Israeli and Jewish Americans to share traditions at Shabbat dinners and celebrations of other Jewish festivals. Gvanim: A leadership program that explores the hybrid identities of Israeli-Americans. Lead and Dor Chadash: These are young leadership programs aimed at building a network of young Israeli-American professionals and connecting them to their Jewish identity and Israel. Bina: This program connects Israeli-American and Jewish young professionals. Merkaz: The IAC has opened centers in Florida, Boston and New Jersey for Israeli-Americans to meet for education programs, lectures, Torah study and other activities to reinforce their Jewish and Israeli identities. ACT.IL: This joint project of the IAC and the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya’s Public Diplomacy Center was created to improve Israel’s image using social media. IAC for Action recently achieved a major success in convincing Nevada to adopt anti-boycott legislation. One of the catalysts for the Nevada legislation was Lieutenant Governor, Mark Hutchison, who visited Israel and came back inspired to do something about BDS, proof once again of the value of taking legislators to Israel. Israeli-Americans were mobilized to lobby the state legislature and built a coalition that included Christians United for Israel and Latino pastors. One interesting coalition partner was Filipinos who have an appreciation for Israel because of the humanitarian assistance provided by the IDF following the typhoon that devastated the Philippines in 2009 and 2013. According to Dillon Hosier, IAC for Action’s National Director of State Government Affairs, the lobbying effort has succeeded because Israeli-Americans frame the issue in terms of protecting minorities from discrimination while the boycotters try to make it about freedom of speech. The IAC argues that if Israelis are discriminated against today, other minorities could be the targets tomorrow. Also, the IAC explains the boycott is a local concern, not a foreign policy issue. “A lot of Israeli companies are setting up shop in Nevada in fields such as water and cybersecurity,” noted Hosier, “and we made the point that they feel threatened by the BDS campaign.” Instead of trying to explain Israel, Hosier added, “we let legislators know their constituents are effected.” Advertisement The IAC has also taken the lead in working with states on the implementation of anti-BDS legislation by providing them with information about companies that are potentially violating the law by boycotting Israel. “We can’t stop assimilation in the entire Jewish community in the United States, so we are devoting our limited resources to the roughly five million Jews who say they are proud to be Jewish,” Milstein says, adding, “We can be a game changer by stopping the alienation toward Israel.” Dr. Mitchell Bard is the author/editor of 24 books including the 2017 edition of Myths and Facts: A Guide to the Arab-Israeli Conflict, The Arab Lobby, and the novel After Anatevka: Tevye in Palestine.

News article:
Israel's education minister has said that, "The Jewish people will never give up any part of Israel's land," Shehab.ps reported on Monday. Naftali Bennett of the far-right Jewish Home party added that the best political reconciliation for the issue of Jerusalem is uniting the city under Israeli sovereignty. Ironically, the extremist politician made his comments at the Haaretz Peace Conference in Tel Aviv. "The Jewish people have no interest in conceding any particle of Israel's land," he insisted. "Peace is not achieved through conceding land, but through force." Reaching a peace deal, he continued, is not a monopoly of the left-wing. "I want peace, but peace with the concept of the rightists. There is no chance of establishing a Palestinian state except in Gaza." Read: Dismissing the concept of a Palestinian state is a priority for Israel's education minister While Bennett accepted that Israelis are destined to live next to the Palestinians, he said that there is no love lost between them. "However, we will not go anywhere else. We have to learn from Gaza 2014. The situation is deteriorating and we have to do our best in order not to go for another military confrontation." Bennett's party supports Israel's colony-settlements across all Palestinian territory and rejects any move to give up any part of the occupied West Bank on which they are built so that a Palestinian state can be established. Jewish Home rejects the two-state solution with East Jerusalem as the capital of a State of Palestine on the 1967 borders.

News article:
Qatar is expelling several senior Hamas members from the Gulf kingdom, in response to outside pressure, a report said Saturday, in a major blow to the Gaza-based terror group. Qatar has been a major backer of Hamas, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the Gaza Strip and sheltering the group’s top leadership in recent years. Hamas was recently informed of the decision by a representative of the Gulf kingdom, who gave Hamas a list of members who must leave Qatar’s capital of Doha, Hebrew media quoted a report from the Hezbollah affiliated al-Mayadeen television station as saying. According to the report, those singled out are Hamas members tasked with coordinating with the terror group’s operatives in the West Bank, and the list of names reportedly came from interrogations of Palestinian security prisoners by Israel. The Qatari’s reportedly apologized for the move, but said it came as a result of “external pressures” on Doha. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms It gave no details on where the outside pressure came from, but it comes just two weeks after US President Donald Trump met with Muslim leaders in Saudi Arabia, calling on them to form a coalition against Islamist terrorism. Israel’s Channel 10 TV on Saturday night quoted Palestinian officials saying the pressure on Qatar to expel Hamas operatives came from Saudi Arabia and the United States. The sources added that the list of names was “only the beginning” and that further expulsions would follow. In Trump’s speech he labelled Hamas as a terror group and bunched it with other terror organizations such as Hezbollah and the Islamic State. While in Riyadh, Trump also met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Advertisement Qatar has also been under fire in recent days from its Gulf neighbors for its closer ties with Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood. Since Hamas wrested control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority in a bloody coup in 2007, Qatar has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the territory and backed Hamas diplomatically, sheltering its exiled former leader Khaled Mashaal. It was not clear Saturday if Mashaal was among those ordered to leave Qatar. In 2012, its then-emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, became the first head of state to visit Gaza under Hamas rule, pledging to raise $400 million toward reconstruction. Mashaal decamped to Doha from the group’s former headquarters in Damascus in 2012 over reported disagreements with the Syrian regime over its brutal crackdown on protesters and rebels in the Syrian civil war, who like Hamas are primarily Sunni Muslims. In addition to Qatar, a number of Hamas operatives are also reported to live in Turkey, namely Saleh al-Arouri, a senior Hamas member who Israel says is in charge of training terror cells in the West Bank.

Two senior Hamas officials have left Qatar since reports surfaced that the Gulf State submitted the terrorist organization a list of members who were required to leave immediately. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The senior Hamas officials were identified as Saleh al-Arouri—believed to be responsible for organizing and directing Hamas members in the West Bank—and Musa Dodin, who was released in the 2011 Shalit prisoner exchange. Musa Dodin (R) and Saleh al-Arouri (L) There are still several more Hamas officials who are required to leave Qatar, but their identities and exact numbers remain unknown. All those leaving Qatar will be dispersed to different countries such as Malaysia, Lebanon and Turkey. Qatar's list of persona non grata Hamas members includes those involved in attempts to establish Hamas terror infrastructure in the West Bank. Al-Arouri had worked for many years to establish Hamas cells in the West Bank in order to carry out terror attacks against a variety of Israeli targets. He had previously been located in Turkey, but was banished as part of the reconciliation agreement between Israel and Ankara. Khaled Mashal in Doha (Photo: AFP) Musa Dodin was active in Hamas' West Bank headquarters, directing terror attacks against Israelis. Dodin is also in charge of the issue of Hamas prisoners in Israel. Dodin's brother has been in administrative detention for more than a year. Hamas admitted Sunday that there were changes in the location of various officials whose names have not been disclosed. However, the organization said it was linked to administrative changes that were made following the internal elections. At the same time, Hamas denied that the request was made by Qatar following external pressure on it.

In light of the Arab boycott of Qatar due to its support for terrorism, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said in an interview with the Russian RT channel during his visit to Moscow that in the eyes of Arab countries, Hamas is a legitimate resistance movement.

"Do we take the easy road or do we finally take a hard but necessary action? We have to stop the funding of terrorism."

Earlier Saturday, US President Donald Trump called on Qatar to stop funding terrorism, claiming credit for and endorsing the decision of Gulf nations to ostracize their neighbor, even as US Cabinet officials said their blockade is hurting the campaign against ISIS. Trump scolds Qatar, urges it to stop funding terrorism (Credit: Reuters) X "We had a decision to make," Trump said, describing conversations with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. "Do we take the easy road or do we finally take a hard but necessary action? We have to stop the funding of terrorism." Saudi Arabia and Bahrain welcomed Trump's demand for Qatar to stop supporting terrorism, but did not respond to a US Department of State call for them to ease pressure on the Gulf state.

Though the United States and most of the world view Hamas as a terrorist group, for the Arab world it is a "legitimate resistance movement," Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said Saturday. >> Get all updates on Israel, the Palestinians and the Middle East: Download our free App, and Subscribe >> “The U.S. views Hamas as a terror organization, but to the rest of the Arab nations it is a legitimate resistance movement. We do not support Hamas, we support the Palestinian people,” said Al Thani, who is currently in Moscow for talks with Russia. Al Thani told told Russia Today this was also the position of the other Gulf states, and he wondered why Qatar was being singled out for its ties to the group. >> Qatar crisis: Saudi Arabia: Qatar must stop supporting Hamas to restore ties ■ WATCH: Saudi ban pushes Qatar flights ■ Confused? Read this ■ Explained: Why it messes up Trump's Iran, ISIS plans ■ Gas field behind crisis << Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed ties with Qatar last week and accused it of sponsoring terrorism, including support of Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said Tuesday that Qatar needed to take several steps, including ending its support of Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, to restore ties with other key Arab states. Shortly after the break in ties emerged, Qatar confirmed that a number of top Hamas officials who were using the country as their base had left amid pressure on the oil-rich Gulf nation. “Hamas’ presence in Qatar doesn’t mean there’s support for Hamas in Qatar," he said, adding that the nation “cooperates with the Palestinian Authority" to promite Palestinian reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah. "Hamas’ presence is a political representation of the Hamas movement,” he said, claiming the organization's leadership was “currently in Palestine” and not in Qatar. Hamas has engaged with a number of Arab states in the past week, especially with Egypt. A delegation of Hamas officials – including the group's new leader, Yahya Sanwar, and the head of its Interior Ministry, Taufik Abu Naim – left the Gaza Strip for talks with Egyptian officials, including those in military intelligence, in Cairo. According to reports in Hamas-affiliated media outlets, a number of issues pertaining to the defense of Gaza and Egypt's shared border were raised during these meetings. Easing the blockade on the Strip was also discussed, specifically in regard to the passage of goods and people through the Rafah crossing. Hamas said the meeting went well. Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official, said over the weekend that although the meetings with the Egyptians were important, a delegation of Hamas officials was planning to depart for Tehran for meetings with top Iranian officials. The delegation would include Ismail Haniyeh, the Gaza-based deputy head of Hamas’ political bureau. If the meeting takes place, it will be the highest-ranking Hamas delegation to go to the Iranian capital in a number of years. Despite speculation about Tehran's plans to host Hamas' leader in exile, Khaled Meshal, the meeting never took place due to tensions over Iran and Hamas' respective positions on the Syrian civil war. Hamas welcomed Al Thani’s statements and spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said in a short statement that the comments were an expression of the values and principles characteristic of a prestigious country like Qatar. Qatar faces isolation by fellow Arab countries after Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt severed ties with Doha Monday, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and their adversary. Iran. Qatar denies the allegations. The crisis is a major diplomatic test for the United States, which is a close ally of countries on both sides but has given mixed signals on whether to isolate Qatar or bring it into talks with other Gulf states. Last Friday, Trump accused Qatar of being a "high level" sponsor of terrorism in remarks made shortly after his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, pushed Qatar's Arab neighbors to "immediately take steps to de-escalate the situation."

News article:
By Dov Benovadia YERUSHALAYIM — After Hamas threatened that Israel’s move to cut off or reduce electricity to the Gaza Strip was “dangerous,” Egypt has reportedly offered to step in and provide the power that Israel and the Palestinian Authority will not – on condition that the terror group mend its ways. A report in the London-based Al Sharq-Al Awsat newspaper Tuesday quoted Palestinian officials as saying that Cairo made the offer to Hamas conditionally. In order to get the electricity, Hamas will have to surrender 17 wanted terrorists who committed various security offenses in Egypt – including attacking Egyptian security officers – and shut down its network of weapons smuggling tunnels to and from Sinai. Besides electricity, Egypt will supply Gazans with more freedom of movement, increasing the number of permits issued to Gazans to exit the Strip. According to the officials, Egypt believes that Hamas’s current vulnerabilities – it’s been banned by Qatar, one of its chief backers, and condemned by Saudi Arabia, the most influential Arab country in the Middle East – allow it for the first time to influence the terror group. Egypt’s objective is neutralize Hamas as it struggles to get control of Sinai, which is rife with pockets of Islamist rebel groups, from al-Qaida to IS to home-grown organizations that seek to overthrow the government of Egyptian leader A-Sisi. The Cabinet voted Sunday to cut electricity to Gaza, after the Palestinian Authority declared last week that it would no longer pay Gaza’s electricity bill. The IDF recommended going along with the plan in order to strengthen the position of PA chief Mahmoud Abbas in his dispute with Hamas. PA officials declared last week that they were tired of sharing the blame for Hamas’ terror activities, as the humanitarian aid transferred to Gaza – including money to pay for basic services – is used to build terror tunnels and pay terrorists. Channel Two quoted PA officials as saying the ongoing terror activities of Hamas is damaging their standing with the new administration in Washington, and that they would no longer pay for those activities. In response, Hamas threatened to rain terror on the head of Israelis. In a statement, a Hamas spokesperson said that “those who are responsible for this decision – both the Israeli enemy that blockades Gaza, and PA chief Mahmoud Abbas in his immoral role aiding the enemy – will pay. This is a dangerous decision that will lead to an explosion.” Under current arrangements, Israel supplies power to Gaza, with the PA billing Gaza residents and transferring the payment to the Israel Electric Corporation. However, the payments account only for a portion of the total bill; the rest is paid by the PA out of money it receives from international donors specifically for the humanitarian needs of Gaza.

News article:
Egypt has cancelled a planned visit by a delegation from the secular Fatah movement which would have coincided with an official visit by Hamas to Cairo for talks about mutual relations, local sources revealed to Quds Press on Tuesday. The Cairo-Hamas meeting will also look at issues related to easing the situation in the besieged Gaza Strip. According to the anonymous Egyptian sources, the Fatah delegation led by Azzam Al-Ahmad planned to ensure that the talks between Hamas and the government in Cairo are restricted to the Palestinian reconciliation issue. They explained that reconciliation is not intended to be the main topic of the talks with Hamas during the nine-day visit. "Fatah wants to undermine any meeting between Hamas and reformist Fatah leaders led by Mohamed Dahlan," the sources added. Pressure is being put on Hamas by Fatah to accept the Palestinian Authority's conditions for reconciliation. Former Fatah official Dahlan, who is described by his followers as the leader of Fatah reformists, enjoys good relations with the Egyptian authorities and many other regional powers.

The Egyptian government is keen to see Hamas resolve the issue of the Israeli soldiers it has held since the military offensive against the Gaza Strip in 2014. This was the message given in a meeting with a Hamas delegation visiting Egypt this week, Al-Araby Al-Jadeed has reported. Citing a security official within the delegation, the newspaper said that, "It seemed clear to the Hamas delegation that the Egyptian side is keen to solve this issue, and quickly." The official explained that this may be due to the Israeli prime minister needing political support from the general public. A senior Hamas officer in the Gaza Strip said that the meetings in Cairo focused on security, the border area with Gaza and increasing coordination with the Egyptian authorities. The Hamas delegation included the Commander of the security services in the Gaza Strip, Tawfiq Abu Naim, and Marwan Issa, the chief of staff of the Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of the movement, which is believed to be holding the soldiers. Read: Israel will exploit Arab rift to kill our people says Hamas Meanwhile, a source close to ousted Fatah official Mohammed Dahlan has revealed that a Hamas delegation headed by Ismail Haniyeh met with Samir Mashharawi, a prominent leader among Dahlan's supporters. The meeting, it was pointed out, was held before former Prime Minister Haniyeh took over the leadership of the Hamas political bureau. It is claimed that five similar meetings have taken place, one of them attended by Dahlan himself. "The entire region is going through turbulent conditions, and the Palestinian issue is no longer the one that tops the Arab and Islamic agenda," the source explained. "The meetings between us and the brothers in Hamas, under Egyptian auspices, aim to alleviate the suffering of Gaza and its people, especially given that Dahlan has strong Arab ties to help him."

News article:
It seems that the unthinkable is about to take place. Reports that Mohammed Dahlan — a fierce foe of Hamas — is moving slowly but surely to forge a new alliance with Hamas to jointly run Gaza are going viral. The midwife of this new rapprochement between Dahlan and Hamas is Egypt. These reports state that representatives of Hamas met the Egyptian intelligence chief and discussed a new approach to lift the siege imposed on Gaza for years. They agreed to have Dahlan chair a committee in charge of Gaza affairs. As a quid pro quo, Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt will be open and Egypt will increase electricity supply to Gaza. According to the leaked deal, Hamas will run the internal affairs, leaving Dahlan to coordinate with Egypt and Israel to secure lifting the siege and security. But Hamas is also to beef up its forces on the Egyptian-Gaza border to help prevent terrorists passing from Gaza into Sinai. The committee will be financed by taxes being collected in Gaza. But I also assume that given Dahlan’s special ties with the United Arab Emirates, he will manage to secure big financial aid. And, perhaps, the Emirates will replace Qatar as the funder of Gaza. If this to materialise, Gaza will be on a slippery road to break off completely with the West Bank. Dahlan — also a bitter rival of Mahmoud Abbas — is to finally enjoy a foothold in Gaza. Two decades ago, Dahlan was the strong man of Gaza who chased Hamas activists. But since 2006, Hamas is the ultimate master of Gaza, as Fateh was driven out. However, Palestinians’ alliances are always on shifting sand; Dahlan seeks to oust the Palestinian president under the pretext that Abbas’ presidency has long expired. One does not know yet if the reports are only trial balloons. And yet, it is obvious that Hamas is facing a dilemma, especially after the eruption of the Gulf crisis and Donald Trump’s celebrated visit to Saudi Arabia. There is a new tendency in the region to paint Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist groups, and this could be detrimental to Hamas’ ability to survive. Therefore, it makes perfect sense that Hamas should turn to Egypt to get off the hook. It is not a secret anymore that Egypt, UAE and Saudi Arabia seek to drive a wedge between Hamas and Qatar. They want Hamas to understand that Qatar is no longer a reliable anchor for the movement. Explicit in their statements and policies is that Hamas is to be designated as a terrorist group, a step that could potentially further emasculate the movement. Although a break between Qatar and Hamas could lead to an undesirable outcome — driving Hams into Iran’s orbit — these countries seem to be willing to play this gambit. It is not surprising, therefore, that Hamas is not on the list of terrorists that was adopted by Egypt, Bahrain, UAE and Saudi Arabia. Obviously, they still want to lure Hams to work with Dahlan. To be sure, Dahlan is set to gain more if this arrangement continues unchecked. He has left no stone unturned to assume a leading position in Palestine. Of course, his move can catapult him to prominence and Israel can celebrate that Dahlan is a man to be relied on, but Gaza and the West Bank are to go separate directions. [email protected]

News article:
Qatar may be losing one of its regional assets and a major component in its divisive interventionist network in the wake of its recent diplomatic spat with Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt. Hamas, the Islamist resistance movement that took hold of Gaza Strip 10 years ago, is distancing itself from its traditional Qatari benefactor while actively exploring ways to mend fences with Cairo and possibly strike an alliance with long-time foe and former Fateh leader in Gaza Mohammad Dahlan. The parting of ways may have been mutually agreed between Gaza and Doha. Qatar is trying desperately to end its Gulf isolation and may have decided that its pro-Hamas positions have become an unnecessary liability. Recent reports said that key Hamas figures living in Qatar have left their Doha refuge “voluntarily”. Hamas saw a change in its top leadership recently, when Khaled Mishaal, head of its political bureau who was living in Qatar, was replaced by Gaza-based Ismail Haniyeh. And since the overthrow of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi in 2013, relations between Cairo and Gaza have dipped, with the former accusing Hamas of carrying out terrorist activities in Egypt. An economic blockade imposed by Israel since the 2014 war on the strip, has made the lives of over 2 million Gaza residents unbearable. Repeated attempts to end the rift between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority were met with failure. Qatar, which has been involved in mediation efforts between the PA and Hamas, had clearly taken sides, undermining PA President Mahmoud Abbas’ authority and pushing Hamas to walk back on agreements. Abbas’ leadership of Fateh continues to be challenged by Dahlan, who is backed by the UAE and Egypt. It is no surprise that news of meetings between Dahlan and top Hamas leaders in Cairo in the past week were made public. There is pressure on Hamas to end its ties with Qatar and modify its political platform. Last month, Hamas announced that it will accept a Palestinian state on the June 4, 1967, borders without recognising Israel and severed ties with the Muslim Brotherhood. It is also important to note that Hamas was not included in the list of terrorist organisations, released by Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies, as well as Egypt, in spite of US President Donald Trump’s description of Hamas as a terrorist group last month. On the opposite side, Abbas, fearing that Hamas may get a reprieve from Egypt and strike a deal with Dahlan, has applied pressure on the beleaguered Gaza Strip. Last April, he took the contentious move of slashing the salaries of thousands of PA civil and military employees in Gaza. The pay cut, which triggered mass protests and denunciations across the strip, was meant to tighten the noose around Hamas’ neck, but it also hurt Abbas who was unrelenting. Last week, it was reported that he had asked Israel to reduce daily electricity supply to Gaza by one third, from four to three hours. Israel complied. Abbas’ gambit appears to have backfired. Hamas’ strategic relationship with Cairo, and by extension the Gulf, was strengthened and the crisis with Qatar may have given it a much-needed lifeline. An agreement with Dahlan will result in the opening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and a quick easing of the humanitarian situation there. In return, Dahlan will re-establish a presence in the strip and create, with Hamas, a national salvation front to challenge the dysfunctional PLO and the besieged PA. In addition, Hamas will gradually distance itself from Iran, thus improving its stance with the US and, more importantly, with the new anti-Iran Arab-Muslim coalition. Meanwhile, Israel has sent messages that the likelihood of a new confrontation with Hamas is minimal. Israel has a lot to gain from recent developments. The Dahlan factor will rein in the Islamist movements’ military arm and will establish a more formal channel of communication between the strip and Israel. It will also weaken Abbas politically and formalise the separation between the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli hardliners believe the future Palestinian state will be established in Gaza, leaving the fate of the West Bank to be negotiated on the basis of self-governing cantons enjoying what has been described as economic peace. But it is still doubtful that the Hamas-Dahlan rapprochement can be tenable in the long run, especially that the movement’s pro-Iran hawks remain in charge. What is clear is that Hamas is facing existential threats and rising disgruntlement among the people of the strip. It has few choices: either cave in to Abbas and hand over power to the PA or join hands with his archrival and reap the rewards of an open border with Egypt. Abbas is reportedly mulling the idea of delegitimising Hamas and declaring the strip a rogue district. The latest developments involving Hamas could very well be part of a much larger realignment that aims at rearranging the priorities of regional players. The formula being suggested is risky and indicates growing discontent with Abbas by some Arab states. In the short run, Hamas will benefit from the easing of the economic blockade and from normalising relations with Egypt and key Gulf states, but by burning its bridges with Abbas — one can argue that he accelerated such a move — it may also be fulfilling a major Israeli objective.

Amid an escalating conflict between Hamas and the Fatah-ruled Palestinian Authority (PA), a leaked and unconfirmed document obtained by Ma’an News Agency in Gaza has noted that discharged Fatah leader and President Mahmoud Abbas’ political rival Muhammad Dahlan would be appointed head of Gaza’s government as a result of talks between Hamas officials and Dahlan in Cairo. The document, titled “A National Consensus Document for Trust-Building” details an agreement allegedly made between the Hamas movement, led by Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, and Dahlan during Egyptian-sponsored talks where Palestinian officials established a political front to challenge the PA in coordination with Dahlan. P.A President Mahmoud Abbas plans to hold a meeting of National Council to confront any alliance between Hamas and leader Mohammed Dahlan." https://t.co/XML7XSBLBd — Flat Eric (@armor1er) June 26, 2017 Dahlan, being a fierce former opponent of Hamas’ rule in Gaza following its success in the 2006 elections that threw Fatah and Hamas in a protracted internal conflict, seemed like an unlikely political ally for Hamas. Nevertheless, analysts have pointed out that the new relationship between the former rivals represents Dahlan and Hamas’ mutual rejection of the PA, led by Abbas in the occupied West Bank. According to the document, the talks agreed that Dahlan would be head of the government in the Gaza Strip, while Hamas would control Gaza’s Ministry of Interior. The reports have not been confirmed by Hamas or Dahlan. (Maan, PC, Social Media)

News article:
A Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo on Sunday for talks with Egyptian officials on security issues and Cairo’s assistance to the Israeli-besieged Gaza Strip. The delegation includes representatives from the interior, health, economic and finance ministries, according to Hamas’s statement, as reported by Al-Ahram Arabic website. “The delegation will discuss security talks on the borders, the Rafah border crossing, electricity and fuel issues,” the statement read. Hamas representatives visited Egypt for talks with officials last month. Relations between Egypt and the Palestinian Islamist group with rules the Gaza Strip were strained in the wake of the ouster of then-president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013. Cairo had accused Hamas of backing Egypt's banned Muslim Brotherhood organisation and of smuggling goods and arms through tunnels under the Gaza-Sinai border. In early 2017, Palestinian Hamas leader Mahmoud El-Zahar said that the movement's relations with Cairo have improved, evidenced by the reaching of an agreement on border control between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. In its new manifesto, released in February, Hamas, which was founded in 1989, rebranded itself as an Islamic national liberation movement, rather than a branch of the pan-Arab Muslim Brotherhood, which has been outlawed in Egypt. In late June, Egypt trucked 1 million litres of cheap diesel fuel to the Gaza Strip's sole power plant to temporarily eased a crippling electricity crisis in the enclave, according to the AP, which quoted Hamas officials. The Hamas delegation arrived in Egypt on Sunday via the Rafah border crossing, which was opened specifically for them. Egypt has kept its border with the Gaza Strip largely closed since Morsi’s ouster. Cairo periodically opens the border to allow civilians with foreign passports, Palestinian students, and those with medical needs to travel back and forth. The crossing in northern Sinai is the only gateway for 1.8 million Palestinians living in Israeli-besieged Gaza to enter and exit the enclave after Israel imposed a naval and land blockade since the Islamist Hamas movement became its de-facto ruler in 2006, inflicting increasing suffering on the impoverished population. It is the only terminal not controlled by Israel. Cairo plays a central role in reconciliation efforts between rival Palestinian factions, as well as efforts to end the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Search Keywords: Short link:

Source: Xinhua| 2017-07-06 01:38:52|Editor: Song Lifang Islamic Hamas movement leader Ismail Haniya gives a speech in Gaza City, on July 5, 2017. Islamic Hamas movement leader Ismail Haniya on Wednesday called for forming a Palestinian unity government and preparing for holding general elections in and beyond the Palestinian territories. Haniya made the remarks in an aired public speech he addressed to the Palestinians. It is his first speech since he was elected chief of the movement's politburo on May 6. (Xinhua/Wissam Nassar) GAZA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Islamic Hamas movement leader Ismail Haniya on Wednesday called for forming a Palestinian unity government and preparing for holding general elections in and beyond the Palestinian territories. Haniya made the remarks in an aired public speech he addressed to the Palestinians. It is his first speech since he was elected chief of the movement's politburo on May 6. "I call on all Palestinian factions to start forming a clear and specific political program based on common interests and focuses on the goals of our people," said Haniya, adding "I call on the factions to form a national unity government that fulfills its commitment to our people in the West bank, Gaza and everywhere." He also said that he was willing to end the ten years of internal division with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah Party, on the conditions of cutting down security coordination and cooperation with Israel in the West Bank. Abbas took a series of unprecedented measures against Hamas, based on cutting salaries of employees and stopping paying for electricity and fuels, aiming at exerting pressure on the movement to accept his terms for ending division. Haniya also said that he calls for the preparations for holding the Palestinian elections, presidential and legislative and set up a date for holding it, adding "Hamas doesn't fear from the elections to join it." He went on saying that he has discussed with Egypt on the question of reconciliation during the visit of Hamas delegation to Cairo last month, declaring that Hamas "has opened a new page in the relationship with Egypt." Ties between Hamas and Egypt deteriorated after the Islamic movement expressed support for the ousted former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood, a group blacklisted by the current Egyptian administration. Egyptian courts outlawed Hamas and its armed wing al-Qassam Brigades. The Egyptian media accused Hamas of backing opposition military groups in Egypt that aimed at disturbing the Egyptian security.

(Xinhua/Wissam Nassar) GAZA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Islamic Hamas movement leader Ismail Haniya on Wednesday called for forming a Palestinian unity government and preparing for holding general elections in and beyond the Palestinian territories. Haniya made the remarks in an aired public speech he addressed to the Palestinians. It is his first speech since he was elected chief of the movement's politburo on May 6. "I call on all Palestinian factions to start forming a clear and specific political program based on common interests and focuses on the goals of our people," said Haniya, adding "I call on the factions to form a national unity government that fulfills its commitment to our people in the West bank, Gaza and everywhere." He also said that he was willing to end the ten years of internal division with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah Party, on the conditions of cutting down security coordination and cooperation with Israel in the West Bank.

News article:
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — The new leader of the militant Hamas group has delivered his first public speech in the Gaza Strip since his election in May. Ismail Haniyeh addressed supporters on Wednesday in Gaza City, repeating Hamas’ traditional hard-line stance against Israel. But he also called for unity with the rival Palestinian Authority of President Mahmoud Abbas. Hamas took control of Gaza a decade ago from Abbas’ forces, leaving him in control only in the West Bank. Reconciliation efforts have repeatedly failed. Haniyeh laid out conditions Abbas will likely oppose, such as formation of a unity government and an end to Abbas’ security coordination with Israel. The speech likely attempted to pave the way for a new partnership with Mohammed Dahlan, an exiled Abbas rival who is seeking a return to Palestinian politics.

Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh on Wednesday, in his first speech as head of the terror group’s political bureau, hailed an era of new relations with Cairo that would ease the blockade of Gaza, and made clear that Hamas has not changed its goal of liberating all of historic Palestine. In a speech that was meant to show Hamas’s priorities under its new leadership, the 54-year-old native Gazan, speaking from a hotel in Gaza city, strayed little from the tone and content of his predecessor, Khaled Mashaal. With his characteristic preacher zeal, he railed against “Israeli violations” in Jerusalem and against the al Aqsa Mosque, promised to free Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, and emphasized that “not one inch” of Palestinian land could be relinquished. “We will remain faithful to the principles of the Palestinian people, and at the forefront is the liberation of the land, of Jerusalem, of the al-Aqsa Mosque, the prisoners, the realization of the Palestinian right of return, and the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.” https://twitter.com/hamasinfo/status/882655275785826310 Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “The release of the prisoners has become closer than ever,” he added, but did not elaborate how such an outcome could occur. Hamas has denied it is negotiating a prisoner exchange with Israel. He also slammed the recent efforts of US President Donald Trump to restart peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians. Advertisement “We believe that the most dangerous thing official Palestinian policy suffers from is responding to and dealing with repeated American dictates,” he said. Haniyeh also said that “since the arrival of the American president to power, with the pressure and encouragement of the Zionist enemy,” Trump has been trying to “eliminate the Palestinian issue” by “blackmailing” Arab-Islamic powers “and imposing a so-called historic reconciliation.” During his speech, Haniyeh gave thanks to the terror group’s state backers, Iran, Turkey and Qatar, as well as to the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. However, Haniyeh emphasized his thanks to Egypt, which he said had agreed to a number of measures that will relieve the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. A high-level Hamas delegation spent nine days in Cairo earlier in June, as part of an effort by the terrorist group to improve relations with Egypt, strained since the overthrow of Mohammed Morsi, Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood president, in 2013. Hamas was affiliated with the Brotherhood. “I declare clearly that we have turned a new page in our relationship [with Egypt],” Haniyeh said. Advertisement The new measures, Haniyeh said, include the opening of the Rafah crossing between the Strip and Egypt, as well as a number of humanitarian and economic projects in the Palestinian enclave. Since late last month, Egypt has sold and sent millions of liters of diesel fuel to Gaza, so the Strip’s only power plant could begin operating again after months of being shut down. It is unclear how long Egypt will continue to send fuel to Gaza, which is seeing 4 to 6 hours of power a day after the Palestinian Authority stopped covering 35 percent of the cost of Israeli-supplied electricity to the Strip. Haniyeh did not mention the reported deal being cooked up between Hamas and Mohammad Dahlan, PA President Mahmoud Abbas’s rival in the Fatah party. Dahlan is a former Fatah leader and was considered a strongman in Gaza before being ousted in the 2006 coup that brought Hamas to power in the Strip. He was expelled from the Palestinian territories by Abbas in 2011. Dahlan and Hamas reportedly agreed to establish a new “management committee” of Gaza, which would see the Fatah strongman share control of the Palestinian enclave. However, Haniyeh did say that reconciliation between Ramallah and Gaza was part of the discussions in Egypt, and that Hamas “welcomes the resumption of Egypt’s central role in the issue of reconciliation and Palestinian nationalism.” “Fatah won’t eliminate Hamas and Hamas won’t eliminate Fatah,” said Haniyeh, adding that together, with all the Palestinian factions united, “the occupier could be eliminated.”

News article:
Hamas leader Ismail Haniya said Wednesday recent talks in Egypt could lead to improving the humanitarian suffering in the impoverished Gaza Strip. The head of the Palestinian Islamist movement said it found Egyptian officials "ready to work to address the crises in Gaza" during a recent trip in which Hamas leaders, led by its Gaza head Yahya Sinwar, met with Egyptian officials in Cairo. "The Egyptian authorities issued a package of measures and policies and fuel began to enter to the power plant, and work continues at the Rafah crossing to reopen it in the near future." "The result will have the effect of alleviating the burden of the siege against our people in the Gaza Strip," Haniya said. He did not give further specific details. Gaza has been blockaded by Israel for a decade while Egypt, the only other country the Palestinian enclave shares a border with, has also largely sealed off its crossing in recent years. Hamas has had strained relations with Egypt since the overthrow of Mohammed Morsi, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood president, in 2013. The current Egyptian government led by former military leader Abdel Fatah al-Sisi has closed hundreds of smuggling tunnels along the border and accused Hamas of supporting Islamist radicals inside Egypt, including near the frontier. In recent months though, relations between Gaza and Cairo have somewhat thawed. Last month, Egypt began delivering a million liters (264,200 gallons) of fuel to Gaza, temporarily easing a power crisis that had left the Palestinian enclave's two million residents with only a few hours of electricity per day. Last week Hamas began building a security buffer zone along the Egyptian border to reduce smuggling.

News article:
Speaking to supporters in Gaza on Wednesday, Haniya reaffirmed the group's policy of not interfering in Egypt's internal affairs, saying Hamas will not allow the Strip to be used as a shelter or haven for anyone who intends to harm Egyptian national security. The group also stressed in a statement on Wednesday its respect and appreciation for Egypt's historical role in supporting the Palestinian cause. The statement pointed to the last week's talks between Hamas and Egyptian officials in Cairo, which it says "have led to some results that will help ease the situation in Gaza." The statement added that the talks also touched upon the resumption of Palestinian national reconciliation efforts. Relations between Egypt and the Palestinian Islamist group, which rules the Gaza Strip, were strained in the wake of the ouster of Egypt's Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013. Cairo had accused Hamas of backing Egypt's banned Muslim Brotherhood organisation and smuggling arms through tunnels under the Gaza-Sinai border. Egypt had also accused members of Hamas of involvement in the 2015 assassination of Egyptian prosecutor-general Hisham Barakat. Since the start of this year, top Hamas officials have payed several visits to Cairo for talks with Egyptian officials. In early 2017, Hamas leader Mahmoud Al-Zahar said that the group's relations with Cairo were witnessing improvement, evidenced by the reaching of an agreement on border control between Gaza and Egypt. In an unprecedented move in February, Hamas, which was founded in 1989, rebranded itself in its new manifesto as an Islamic national liberation movement, rather than a branch of the pan-Arab Muslim Brotherhood, which has been outlawed in Egypt. Last month, a delegation headed by Hamas' newly elected political bureau leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar visited Cairo and discussed the humanitarian situation in the besieged Gaza Strip and Egypt's role in alleviating the siege. In late June, Egypt trucked 1 million litres of cheap diesel fuel to Gaza's sole power plant to temporarily eased a crippling electricity crisis in the Strip. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Egyptian and Palestinian leaders met in Cairo on Sunday amid signs of a rapprochement between Cairo and Hamas that could shake up Gaza's political landscape and sideline the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. Officials close to Mr Abbas said the Palestinian leader met with Egyptian president Abdel Fattah El Sisi to seek clarifications on what appears to be an emerging power-sharing agreement between Gaza's Hamas rulers and an exiled Abbas rival, Mohammed Dahlan. Mr Dahlan, who currently lives in the UAE, was a former leading figure in Mr Abbas's Fatah movement. Under the apparent deal — parts of which have been confirmed by other parties involved — Hamas would retain control over Gaza's security, while Mr Dahlan would eventually return to Gaza and handle its foreign relations. Neither leader made any comments to the media after their meeting in Cairo, and a statement by Egypt's presidential spokesman stuck to generalities. The two leaders, the statement said, discussed the latest developments in the Palestinians' bid for statehood and ways to revive the peace process. Mr Dahlan was a key Fatah figure behind the Fatah-Hamas street clashes that erupted after Hamas' victory in parliamentary elections in 2006, which eventually led to the violent takeover of Gaza by the group a year later. Mr Dahlan and Hamas have been bitter enemies, but their interests began to align in recent months. Mr Dahlan's desire to return from exile and one day succeed Mr Abbas has coincided with Hamas' growing desperation as the Palestinian president applies greater financial pressure on Gaza. The emerging understandings between Egypt, Hamas and Mr Dahlan could pose a serious political threat to Mr Abbas and the prospects of Palestinian statehood in the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem — the lands Israel captured in the 1967 war. A Palestinian "mini state" in Gaza could undermine the official state sought by Mr Abbas and others within pre-1967 lines. If implemented, such understandings would likely help ease Gaza's decade of isolation, but would also deepen the Israeli-enforced disconnect between Gaza and the West Bank. Egypt has long accused Hamas of providing sanctuary, as well as supporting, Islamic militants fighting its security forces in the turbulent north of the Sinai Peninsula, a region that borders Gaza and Israel. For Hamas's decade-long rule of Gaza, Egypt has joined Israel in a blockade of the Palestinian territory. But relations between Egypt and Hamas appear to have recently thawed. Hamas officials said the two sides have negotiated security arrangements for the Gaza-Egypt border to ensure that militants operating in Sinai don't use Gaza as a refuge. In line with the agreement, Hamas has begun creating a security buffer zone along Gaza's border with Egypt. In return, Cairo has provided Gaza's rulers with fuel for its power station, easing the rolling blackouts that have for long fed discontent among the territory's two million residents. The Egyptian fuel shipments appear to have undermined the stepped-up financial pressure on Hamas by Mr Abbas. The Palestinian president had hoped such measures, including subsidy cuts and a reduction in payments for Gaza electricity, would force Hamas to cede ground in Gaza and gradually turn the population against the ruling group. Speaking ahead of the meeting between Mr El Sisi and Mr Abbas in Cairo, an Egyptian diplomat briefed on the issues said Egypt's president was expected to tell the Palestinian leader that Cairo cannot keep Gaza sealed off forever, and that it needs to attend to the territory's needs. He said Mr El Sisi was also expected to tell Mr Abbas that he was welcome to play a senior role in Gaza. The officials close to Mr Abbas said they had only heard of the Dahlan-Hamas and Egypt-Hamas agreements second-hand, increasing their concerns. In remarks on Saturday, Gaza-based Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh lauded the new security co-ordination with Egypt. Speaking a day after ISIL militants killed at least 23 Egyptian soldiers in the deadliest attack in Sinai in two years, he said Hamas was "carrying out intensive measures on the border with Egypt to prevent any infiltration" into Gaza after the attack. Separately, Mr Dahlan and Hamas reached several understandings, according to officials on both sides. Mr Abbas's aides said such contacts would only have been possible with Egypt's blessing. Mr Dahlan went into exile after falling out with the Palestinian president in 2010 and has since forged strong ties with Egypt, as well as the UAE. The officials said they were told that as a first step, Mr Dahlan was expected to disburse Dh$50 million (Dh183.7m) in UAE funds to the families of those killed in the Hamas-Fatah street fighting of 2006 and 2007. One of his main lieutenants, Samir Masharawi, an exiled Fatah leader from Gaza, was to return to the territory to start implementing the deal.

News article:
Three days ago, a senior official Hamas delegation ended a meeting with senior Egyptian officials held in Cairo. The visit came about ten days after the conclusion of a previous visit of top Hamas leaders to Cairo, including the Chief of Hamas' political bureau in Gaza, Yahya Al-Sinwar. Such visits, as Hamas said, included discussions about promoting Hamas' relationship with Cairo and led to taking actual measures ahead of facilitating the 11-year-old Israeli, Egyptian and internationally-backed siege on the coastal enclave. Cairo has previously accused Hamas of spying on it, carrying out flagrant security violations in Egypt and supporting a Daesh affiliate in Sinai. Cairo also blamed Hamas and the countries supporting it including Qatar and Turkey for many of its crises. Both Hamas and Egypt said that mutual meetings and discussions had resulted in positive outcomes. Egypt started to export fuel to the besieged enclave to run Gaza's sole electricity plant. Hamas leaders have also said that Egypt will permanently open the Rafah crossing for commercial use as well as to allow passengers to travel in and out of the Strip. The movement also said that a senior Egyptian delegation is planning to visit Gaza to study its needs and start sending aid and experts to improve the Strip. Read: Abbas arrives in Cairo ahead of meeting with Sisi Almost all the Palestinian residents of Gaza are cautious about the positive Egyptian measures and plans towards the war-torn region. Many believe Hamas has fallen into an Egyptian trap as the movement's former foe, former Fatah leader Mohammed Dahlan and his supporters, will return to the Strip as a result of the Egyptian-Hamas agreement. Hamas blames Dahlan and his supporters for the bloodshed that preceded its control of Gaza in 2007. Many Gazans fear the return of Dahlan will destabilise the security situation in Gaza once again. Others believe that Egypt is working towards implementing the old-new plan of the alternative homeland of the Palestinians – creating an independent Palestinian state in Gaza and parts of Sinai. Some Palestinians believe Egypt has prepared thousands of tents in Sinai and is waiting for an Israeli war to start in order to open the Gaza border and allow Palestinians to seek refuge there, thus a "new Palestine" would be born. A third group of Gaza residents believe that the Hamas-Cairo meetings and understandings were ordered by Israel in order for the movement to relinquish its control of the Strip. They believe that the reduction of the Israeli electricity supply to Gaza was not actually ordered by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, but that it was an Israeli plan which used the Palestinians for cover. They also believe that Israel will continue to reduce electricity supplies to Gaza until they are stopped. Palestinians in Gaza would be oblivious to this, however, as the Egyptian fuel is being pumped in to ensure the electricity plant remains operational and the electricity levels are maintained. These people also believe that Egypt will open the Rafah crossing, however once it is in full control of Gaza's main lifelines it will start tightening its grip and start inflicting suffering on the people of Gaza. Its control of the border crossing would mean only the items it wishes to allow to cross would be allowed through and only the travellers it wants to let in and out will have access to Rafah. It would also mean Egypt could suspend fuel supplies at any time. This would mean Palestinians and the international community could no longer blame Israel for the misery inflicted on the citizens of Gaza. A very small portion of Gaza's residents are hopeful that the Hamas-Cairo meetings and understandings are serious and the Egyptians are working to facilitate the life of Gazans. Among those, who believe in this hypothesis, is Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Al-Sinwar. A senior Hamas official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told me: "We are dealing with Cairo on the basis of good will, but when it reverts, we will take the needed measures." Does this mean we will see Hamas fighting Egypt one day? "No, we know our enemy very well. If Egypt retreated, we will not fight it, we will fight Israel," he explained. It appears that Hamas is dealing with Egypt without meeting confident that its neighbour will safeguard Palestinian safety long term or keep to the terms of its agreement. But this, I am told, is "because of the people's suffering which has reached an unbearable level." For me, the new initiative is an effort to move Cairo into the position of the prime mediator in a prisoner swap deal which would meet more of Israel's conditions than those of Hamas. This would be a similar outcome to the Hamas-Egyptian talks during the 2014 Israeli offensive on Gaza.

News article:
On previous occasions rapprochement between Cairo and Hamas have typically occurred in the framework of bilateral arrangements which fall apart almost as soon as they are agreed because of Hamas’ failure to meet its obligations (generally related to security issues such as requests to hand over individuals implicated in the support of terrorist organisations accused of carrying out attacks in Egypt). However, on this current occasion, the Palestinian Authority is absent from the latest moves, and what is more, Mohamed Dahlan has assumed a major role in possible new arrangements, raising the question of how the PA views the latest developments. The mooted changes are being directly informed by regional developments — not least the crisis with Qatar — which continue to have an impact on Hamas’ foreign policy. While Gaza has upped its praise and flattery of Doha, it is noteworthy that it has, contrary to habit, refrained from criticising Egypt. In fact, it softened its political rhetoric towards Egypt just as Cairo was delivering much needed fuel to Gaza, the most recent consignment being delivered last week in order to restart Gaza’s electricity supply which ground to a halt when Israel cut off fuel supplies last month. The latest fuel supplies, moreover, were delivered two days after the terrorist attack in Al-Barth, south of Rafah. Among those who carried out the attack were three Daesh operatives -- former members of the Ezzeddin Al-Qassam brigades, Hamas’ paramilitary wing. Hamas condemned the attack strongly and its officials took part in condolence ceremonies arranged by Egyptians in Gaza. The head of Hamas’ political bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, who attended the ceremonies, said that Hamas “will take intensive measures along Gaza’s borders with Egypt to prevent infiltration from either side.” Despite such significant gestures, sources in Cairo believe that while Hamas may not have been directly involved in the attack, it still bears culpability because in the end it is responsible for what takes place in Gaza. Sources in Cairo say the arrangements which emerged from recent meetings in Cairo are still in effect. The meetings between a Hamas delegation headed by Yehia Al-Sanwar paved the way for a Palestinian security delegation to arrive in Cairo to discuss measures to secure the Egyptian-Gaza border, including the creation of a buffer zone on the Gazan side. Meetings, still in progress as this report was filed, between Hamas and Dahlan’s representatives, are being held after earlier meetings between Dahlan and Al-Sanwar resulted in a number of agreements. One leaked arrangement is that Dahlan will pay compensation for the dead and wounded during the battle for Gaza in 2007 when he was head of the national security apparatus. Another agreement involves the creation of a new government that will share control of the security agencies, though control of the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing would be under the exclusive supervision of Dahlan. Hamas employees currently involved there would be treated like other PA employees and be paid by Dahlan. Under the agreement, Dahlan would be in a position to return to Gaza and head a new government. Mustafa Al-Ladawi, a political observer from Gaza, says there has been a convergence of interests between Dahlan and the authorities in Gaza. “Dahlan wants to return to Gaza and Hamas is in a predicament,” he told Al-Ahram Weekly. “Both sides have made tactically and temporarily convenient agreements but they could evolve through practice into a more strategic arrangement. Each side has its own agenda. What we can say, however, is that Gaza is ripe for this kind of agreement given the economic straits Gazans are in.” Sources in Cairo say Dahlan will send a delegation that will include Samir Mashharawi to launch the mutual arrangements with Cairo. Although this suggests implementation will begin soon some obstacles remain. Al-Ladawi envisages two possible scenarios when it comes to the PA’s response. “Either it will grasp the ‘reconciliation card’ with Hamas and offer compensation so as to keep Gaza within the scope of PA influence or the opposite: turn to Dahlan in the belief he can be restrained or appeased and brought on the PA’s side again.” Al-Ladawi adds that both prospects will give rise to new situations. Egyptian sources say the story leaked to the Palestinian media about a power-sharing arrangement between Dahlan and Hamas has more than a grain of truth, adding the proviso that Cairo has no intentions of creating a parallel authority in Gaza. Cairo will not move away from Mahmoud Abbas, they say. The only suggestion that has been proposed is that Dahlan serve as Gaza’s representative in Europe and the Gulf, not as prime minister, as rumour has it. They add that the expansion of the Rafah crossing to permit for a greater flow of goods and the possible construction of some commercial outlets in Gaza is still subject to feasibility studies. The same sources also confirm that the only agency responsible for supervising the Gazan side of the crossing will be the PA Presidential Guard. Tarek Fahmi, an advisor at the National Centre for Middle Eastern Studies, notes that vis-à-vis Palestine Cairo accords the same degree of attention to Gaza as it does the West Bank. He stresses that no structural action will be undertaken in Gaza without the approval of Mahmoud Abbas. This principle was reaffirmed during Abbas’ visit to Cairo this week when President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi reassured the Palestinian president that no agreement will be made behind his back. Cairo will also continue to engage with all Palestinian factions, from Hamas to Jihad. The relationship between Palestinian parties is, in the end, governed by the agreements they strike among themselves. At the same time, Cairo remains committed to its role concerning the Palestinian cause, and if the details sometimes seem overwhelming, Cairo will not allow them to overshadow the main issues.

News article:
July 13, 2017 Samir al-Mashharawi, the right-hand man of Mohammed Dahlan, Fatah's former leader in the Gaza Strip, arrives in the coastal enclave next week. Dahlan’s supporters view Mashharawi’s arrival as the advent of his return to his roots within the framework of the new alliance forged between him and Hamas with Egypt’s mediation. Just a decade ago, Mashharawi, like Dahlan, was considered Hamas’ greatest enemy. During the 2007 uprising that brought Hamas to power, its armed wing Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades fired rockets toward Mashharawi’s house in Gaza’s Rimal neighborhood. As far as Mashharawi is concerned, the attempt to wipe him out was an act of ingratitude on the part of the man who was to become the movement’s leader, Ismail Haniyeh. Years earlier, a wonderful friendship was forged between Mashharawi, who was a hardcore Fatah member, and Haniyeh. When Israel launched a campaign of targeted eliminations against the Hamas leadership and took out its heads — Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and his successor, Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi — in 2004, Haniyeh found refuge in Mashharawi’s house. Haniyeh, at the time a personal aide to Rantisi, disguised himself as a woman and fled to Mashharawi’s house, evading the fearsome guns of the Israeli Apache helicopters. Three years later, when the armed wing of Hamas tried to assassinate Mashharawi, Haniyeh did not say a word and did not condemn the armed men willing to take out any Fatah member close to Dahlan, even one to whom Haniyeh owed his life. Much has been written about the surprising alliance formed in recent months between Hamas and its former archenemy. Dahlan, also known as Abu Fadi, is now considered the savior angel of Gaza’s residents and their Hamas leaders after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas withdrew his support from half his people (the residents of Gaza) in order to punish Hamas. Last month, Egypt sent a million tons of diesel oil to Gaza to enable the activation of its disabled power plant. A senior Palestinian source told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity that Abbas’ people in the West Bank called the director of the power station Abu Nabil and threatened him. They reportedly told him that if he accepts the shipment — the result of the labors of Abbas’ bitter rival Dahlan — he would make sure that the director was fired. The station head did not give in to the pressure and told the callers that Dahlan was the savior of Gaza’s 2 million besieged residents, and that he had full approval to accept the fuel from those who were once considered Dahlan’s biggest enemies, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. Those already enjoying the fruit of the Hamas-Dahlan reconciliation are his people residing in Gaza, who for years were afraid to speak up. On the one hand, they did not want to anger Hamas, and on the other they feared Abbas’ people in Gaza. Mashharawi’s impending return to the Strip after a decade is not simply a private visit to see his relatives, whom he left in a panicked rush during the uprising. It is also designed to create a mechanism for saving Gaza from collapse as part of the Egyptian-mediated Dahlan-Hamas deal. “Mashharawi was present during all the discussions in Cairo,” one of Dahlan’s people told Al-Monitor on the condition of anonymity. Mashharawi was known in the past as “the mediator” because he was able to settle disputes between Hamas and Fatah for over a decade from the time the Palestinian Authority was established until the Hamas uprising that kicked Fatah out of power in Gaza. He will now have to learn the lay of the land in order to understand the current balance of power in the Strip, given the split within Hamas and the power struggles between its armed and political wings. He will submit his findings to Dahlan. “Abbas never thought in his worst nightmares that the vacuum he was leaving in Gaza would be filled by Dahlan [whom he accused of trying to oust him] and his friends,” a Gaza security source told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity. “But Abu Fadi had no choice but to mobilize to save his people.” Posters and billboards placed recently throughout Gaza, in addition to sprayed graffiti, say, “The President (Abbas) murders children.” The campaign followed a decision by the PA to stop funding medicine and medical equipment for Gaza’s hospitals as part of the sanctions imposed by Abbas on the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank also stopped covering the hospitalization costs of severely ill patients requiring hospital treatment in Israel or the West Bank. Meanwhile, following angry public reaction to the deaths of babies and children denied life-saving treatment, the PA has restored its funding for such cases. Dahlan’s people say, however, that the coverage is more limited than it was before. The senior Palestinian source said Mashharawi will set up a mechanism that will enable the transfer of severely ill Gaza residents to Egypt for treatment in Cairo or Alexandria hospitals, and, if needed, in the Gulf States. The source said a fund of several million dollars has already been established to cover the costs. “In the coming days we will see convoys of ambulances heading toward the Rafah crossing [to Egypt] so that people can get life-saving treatment,” he said. Among all the jobs with which Mashharawi has been tasked, this has top priority, the senior Palestinian source said. Mashharawi has also been tasked with setting up a monitoring mechanism for the activation of the Gaza power station. This mechanism should enable constant contact between Egypt, Hamas and the station operators who are PA employees. These, according to the source, “have come in for constant harassment by Abbas’ people.” In addition to all of the above, Mashharawi will arrange Dahlan’s visit to Gaza. Although no date has been set, his people estimate that it’s a matter of several weeks. “He will come once it becomes clear to all the residents of the Strip that Abu Fadi — he and no one else — is the only one responsible for the improvement of people’s lives after their president cruelly abandoned them,” the Palestinian senior source said.

The Palestinian terror movement Hamas, which has been trying to relocate senior officials who were asked to leave Qatar, has asked Algerian authorities for permission to open an office there, the Arabic daily Asharq Al-Awsat reported Monday. Palestinian sources said that Hamas made a formal request several months ago to open an office in the African country’s capital, Algiers, but has yet to receive a response. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri is currently in Algeria and confirmed that his movement has asked to establish a bureau in the country. Zuhri plans to set up a presence in Algiers and then later bring other Hamas officials to join him, according to the sources. The request was apparently made before the recent crisis between moderate Sunni states in the Persian Gulf and Qatar broke out in June. Saudi Arabia and its allies have cut off ties with Qatar, one of the few foreign backers of Hamas, after accusing the gas-rich state of supporting extremism across the region. Days before the conflict erupted, Qatar had asked several top Hamas officials to leave for Lebanon, Turkey and Malaysia.

Manama: A Saudi policeman was killed in the Qatif area of Saudi Arabia’s eastern province on Thursday, taking the number of security men killed in the area to five. Abdullah Turki Al Turki was killed as terrorists targeted his vehicle when he was patrolling the area. His death comes two days after Adel Al Utaibi was killed and three others injured when their patrol was attacked by terrorists using explosives. Saudi authorities said the attackers, backed by Iran, were attempting to undermine the kingdom’s security and unity, and to incite strife. In earlier attacks in the area, policemen Waleed Al Shibani, Abdul Aziz Al Turki, and Tariq Al Allaqi were killed when terrorists launched rocket-propelled grenades and used explosives to attack them. In an attack in May, assailants fired at workers demolishing abandoned houses, and pedestrians, in Al Masoura district, killing a two-year-old Saudi baby and a Pakistani expatriate, and injuring 10 others, including six Saudis. Heavy machinery working on the project was also targeted by the attackers who hurled explosives in their bid to hamper the work. The Saudi interior ministry said terrorists have been using old houses in Al Masoura district as hideouts and dens for their criminal activities that include murders, kidnappings, armed robberies, and trafficking in drugs, alcohol sale and weapons. The ministry insisted that the development project would go ahead as planned and that security forces would not allow acts of terror to undermine peace. Al Masoura, located in the northeast of Al Awamiya, is one of the town’s oldest areas, inhabited by 1,500 people. However, some of its buildings are more than 100 years old. The development project entails the demolition of 488 residential units and the construction of shopping centres, restaurants, residential towers and a cultural centre.

News article:
Over two dozen Egyptian soldiers have been killed when two bombings targeted security checkpoints in militancy-riddled Sinai Peninsula, which has long been a stronghold of Daesh affiliates in the North . According to Egyptian security officials, two bombers detonated their explosive-laden cars at two checkpoints near an army compound south of Rafah City in northern Sinai on Friday. At least 23 soldiers were killed and 26 more wounded in the assaults, which were claimed by the Takfiri Daesh terror group. The Egyptian army, however, gave a lower toll and said a total of 26 troops were killed or wounded, without giving a breakdown of the figure. The attacks are one of the deadliest to hit the restive region in years. Daesh later said in a statement the military compound came under attack as the Egyptian army was preparing to launch a counterterrorism offensive against the terror group’s affiliates from there. The Egyptian army said its forces killed at least 40 militants and destroyed six of their vehicles in an operation following the attacks. Militant attacks have killed hundreds of soldiers and police in the vast desert district since 2013.Most recently, a security source said Daesh had staged a bomb attack in Sinai, killing three policemen. Read more: Daesh’s Egypt offshoot, known as Velayat Sinai, has also taken on Egypt’s Coptic Christian community. About 100 Copts have been killed in its attacks in mainland Egypt since December. The Egyptian parliament on Tuesday approved President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s decision to extend by three months a state of emergency across the country amid counterterrorism operations in Sinai.

Source: Xinhua| 2017-07-08 23:53:38|Editor: Zhou Xin Video Player Close CAIRO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian police killed 14 terrorists in a fire exchange in a desert area in the Suez Canal province of Ismailia, the Interior Ministry said in a statement on Saturday. The statement said that the gunmen were among the terrorist elements wanted over involvement in terror operations targeting policemen and soldiers in North Sinai province bordering Israel and the Palestinian Gaza Strip. "After getting the prosecution permission, the police on July 8 targeted the desert area in Ismailia that they took as a training camp. Once they felt the forces were approaching they opened fire heavily and the forces dealt with the source of the gunfire, killing 14 terrorist elements," said the police statement. The security raid came one day after a car-bomb terrorist attack in North Sinai. The attack on a checkpoint in North Sinai's Rafah killed and wounded 26 soldiers, while the security forces killed at least 40 of the terrorists, said the Egyptian military spokesman. Meanwhile, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi held a meeting on Saturday with the country's top officials including the ministers of defense, interior affairs and justice as well as the head of the country's general intelligence over Friday's anti-security terrorist attack. "The forces of extremism attempt to undermine stability and security of the country," said the Egyptian president, offering condolences to the families of the army's victims. Egypt has been facing a rising wave of terrorist activities following the military removal of former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in July 2013 in response to mass protests against his one-year rule and his now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group. Terror attacks had been centered in restive North Sinai before they prevailed nationwide, killing hundreds of policemen and soldiers over the past few years. They have recently started to target the Coptic minority and their churches across the country via bombings that killed dozens of them since late December 2016. Most of the terrorist operations were claimed by a Sinai-based group loyal to the regional Islamic State (IS) militant group.

CAIRO — Egyptian police killed six people who allegedly adhered to the Islamic State terror group’s beliefs when a gunfight erupted Monday during a raid on their Nile valley hideout, the government said. The militants opened fire on the police as they approached the hideout in Dairut, a town in the southern province of Assiut, the interior ministry said in a statement on its Facebook page. The police were acting on intelligence that “a group of terrorists who adhere to the beliefs of the Islamic State group were hiding in a residential apartment in uninhabited buildings,” it said. When the six militants opened fire, the police shot back and killed them. The militants were using the hideout as “an organizational base and to prepare to carry out a series of terrorist operations within the southern provinces,” said the ministry.

IS has been leading a deadly insurgency that has killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers since the army overthrew Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, and cracked down on his supporters. While IS has been operating mainly in North Sinai, they have also carried out attacks in other parts of the country, including Cairo. Advertisement The jihadists have increasingly targeted Christians in their campaign, as well. Groups other than IS have also carried out attacks in Egypt targeting policemen and judges. Gunmen on Friday shot dead a National Security Service officer as he was leaving his home north of Cairo. The militant group Hasam claimed responsibility. On Saturday, the interior ministry said police killed two senior Hasam members in a shootout near Cairo.

News article:
The Egyptian people woke up on Friday morning to the news of a terrorist bombing in northern Sinai, killing 26 officers and soldiers and wounding 40 others. Among the dead was Brigadier General Ahmad Al-Mansi, commander of the Thunderbolt Forces. This raises a serious question, as the Thunderbolt Forces do not enter this area. Then, the military statement suddenly changed and did not mention the same things mentioned in their first statement regarding the bombing of a military unit in a suicide bombing. They announced the death of 40 takfirists who attacked the unit. They then leaked a voice recording of Brigadier General Ahmad Al-Mansi asking for help after the unit was destroyed, saying that they will not leave their land, and they will either get justice for our martyrs or die like them. Read: The end of one revolution and the start of another This leak was broadcasted on all the pro-government official and private channels, and when everyone mocked this clearly fabricated recording, in which he used the same chant chanted by the protestors in Tahrir Square who called for justice for their fellow protestors killed by the police during the January Revolution. They chanted: "Either we get justice for our martyrs or we die like them." Instead of the people sympathising with him, like the military staff who fabricated and leaked the recording thought would happen, social networking sites were filled with mocking and sarcastic comments regarding the thoughts of the Egyptian military. The military spokesperson had no other choice but to deny the credibility of the recording. However, between the conflicting military statements which point to a suicide attack and a military attack by Daesh in Sinai, who claimed responsibility for the bombing in a statement, we wonder how the Thunderbolt Force unit could be completely destroyed. It is a well-known fact that the Thunderbolt Forces are the most highly trained and skilled unit, which leads us to the conclusion that the Egyptian fighter is not skilled or trained enough to confront such an attack, despite the fact that they continue to repeat the weak Prophetic hadith: "When you Open Egypt with Islam, take from its people soldiers because they are the best soldiers." How can they be the best soldiers when they are killed and wounded on a daily basis by an organisation made up of 3,500 amateurs, according to the army's statements? However, the army also said that it has killed over 5,000 of the organisation's fighters! Read: Egypt passes 217 laws in eight months Given the lack of transparency in the operations occurring in Sinai, as the government does not allow any media outlet or correspondents to cover the events in Sinai, we only rely on the statements made by the Armed Forces' spokespeople. Moreover, since the people always refute official statements, many have predicted that this unit was in Benghazi fighting Haftar's forces, supported by Al-Sisi militarily, especially since days before this attack, a Libyan website reported the death of a brigadier in the Thunderbolt Forces and his entire squadron. However, no one can confirm this information, despite it being widely circulated on social media. However, this attack in particular, given its large number of casualties, has alarmed the Egyptian people, as the army seemed to be weak and defeated, after having been a source of pride for the Egyptians. Yet its immersion and involvement in civilian life and its penetration of every part of the state and control over 60 per cent of the Egyptian economy has weakened it militarily. It lost its status amongst the people after it began producing biscuits, pasta, jam and pickles instead of tanks and aircraft. The current condition of the Egyptian army is unfortunate, especially after Al-Sisi turned it into a mercenary army, sending it to battles it has no interest in. He has sent pilots to Syria and forces to Libya, and most recently, he sent troops to a military base in Bahrain. Al-Sisi is risking the Egyptian army after getting rid of all the national leaderships, replacing them with his followers who are loyal to him, not Egypt. Therein lies the danger of Al-Sisi's continued rule of Egypt. Is there a savior who can rescue Egypt from loss?

News article:
A knife attacker appears to have exclusively targeted female tourists during a deadly rampage before hotel staff pinned him down and wheeled him away in a luggage cart. Two German women were killed and four more tourists injured during the knife attack at a beach in Egypt. The attack happened on Friday at a Red Sea resort in Hurghada, as police said the assailant swam from a nearby beach before stabbing people. The attacker reportedly shouted: 'Stay away, I don't want Egyptians.' Security and medical sources had earlier reported the two women killed were Ukrainians, but Major General Mohamed El-Hamzawi, security manager of Red Sea province, said victims have been identified as Germans. All six victims are women, Egyptian authorities said. It is not yet confirmed what nationalities the four wounded women are, with one report stating that three were from Serbia and one from Poland, while another said two Czech women had been injured. Workers and security personnel detain the man who stabbed two German tourists to death and wounded four others Two German tourists have died and four of other foreign nationalities have been wounded after a knife attack at the Red Sea resort of Hurghada, in Egypt (pictured, a victim) Police detained the suspect at the scene, saying he swam to the resort from a neighbouring beach before launching his attack (pictured, the alleged suspect detained in what appears to be a luggage cart) Some of those in hospital are in critical condition, according to an Egyptian spokesman (pictured, a bloodied victim on a sofa in a nearby hotel) The attacker was detained at the scene as an extraordinary image shows what appear to be hotel staff holding him down in the bottom of a luggage cart. Authorities have not released a motive for his attack, but ISIS does operate within Egypt and has targeted tourists in the past. Three foreign tourists were stabbed at the same resort in January 2016 by two suspected ISIS militants. On that occasion the assailants - armed with a gun, a knife and a suicide belt - landed on the beach of a hotel in Hurghada by boat before attacking. An Islamic State group bombing of a Russian airliner carrying holidaymakers from a south Sinai resort in 2015 killed all 224 people on board and decimated the country's tourism sector. Russia suspended all flights to Egypt in response and has yet to resume them. IS has been waging a deadly insurgency based in the north of the Sinai Peninsula that has killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers. Hurghada is a popular Egyptian holiday resort, renowned for its scuba diving. The Red Sea is a popular tourist destination for Britons, eastern Europeans and Russians. The attack came hours after five policemen were shot to death Giza when suspected Islamic militants opened fire on their vehicle early in the morning.

News article:
The Egyptian army says it destroyed a number of trucks laden with weapons and explosives Egypt’s army forces foiled an attempt to smuggle arms into the country through its western border with Libya, the military said Sunday. The Egyptian air forces launched a reconnaissance mission Saturday following intelligence received that "criminals" in 4x4 vehicles were in the process of crossing into Egypt, the army said in a statement During the operation, which ontinued into Sunday, forces destroyed 15 vehicles "laden with weapons, explosives and other smuggled items." Forces launched a hunt to catch the "criminals," the statement added. The Egyptian army has been conducting operations in Egypt's Western Desert to stop the infiltration of militants or the smuggling of weapons through the Egyptian-Libyan border. In May, Egyptian fighter jets carried out air strikes against terrorist camps in Libya, hours after gunmen killed 29 Coptic Christians travelling to southern Egypt in a bus attack. Egyptian officials said terrorists in Libya were training militants who carried out the attack. Days later, four army personnel were killed during an army operation against militants in the Western Desert's Bahariya Oasis, near the border with Libya. Security forces have been battling an Islamist insurgency for several years in North Sinai. Militants have killed hundreds of security personnel. Egyptian troops have also killed hundreds of militants during operations in the border region. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Israeli soldiers detain a Palestinian youth during a demonstration outside the Lions Gate, a main entrance to Al Aqsa Mosque compound, due to newly implemented measures by Israeli authorities which include metal detectors and cameras, in Jerusalem’s Old City on Monday (AFP photo) AMMAN — During an emergency meeting on Monday, held upon the request of Palestine, the Council of the Arab League praised His Majesty King Abdullah’s efforts to protect the holy places in Jerusalem as their custodian. The league’s permanent representatives stressed solidarity of the Arab and Islamic nation in the defence of the sanctity of Al Aqsa Mosque/Al Haram Al Sharif and Arab Jerusalem as the capital of the independent state of Palestine, the Jordan News Agency, Petra, reported. The council also stressed its rejection of any alteration to the status quo in Jerusalem and Al Aqsa Mosque. They also highlighted the need to stop all Israeli measures and restore the status quo, including the removal of electronic gates, in addition to respecting the freedom of worship. The council again called on the international community and its organisations to shoulder their responsibilities and stop Israeli provocative acts, to enforce relevant resolutions, preserve the status quo of the Islamic and Christian shrines and protect the Palestinian people in their lands and holy sites. In a related development, Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi on Monday warned of the consequences of continued tension and escalation in Al Aqsa Mosque and stressed the need to work immediately to restore calm to it and to respect the legal and historical situation in its holy places. Safadi stressed that Israel should open the mosque completely and immediately, Petra reported. He pointed out the continued and intensive Jordanian efforts led by King Abdullah to reopen Al Aqsa Mosque and stop the escalation, thus defusing a crisis that would be difficult to control if the escalation continues. During a meeting with a Japanese parliamentary delegation, the minister stressed the need to revive the peace process through serious and effective negotiations that should lead to progress in efforts to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict on the basis of a two-state solution, which, he said, is the only way to achieve security and stability. He said that the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital alongside Israel would bring peace to the region and contribute significantly to defeating extremism and terrorism. For their part, the delegation stressed the importance of developing relations with the Kingdom and their appreciation for the role it has in maintaining security and stability. Alo on Monday, Lower House Speaker Atef Tarawneh met separately with the Japanese delegates, according to Petra. He stressed that the Israeli decision to close Al Aqsa mosque/ Al Haram Al Sharif following a shootout between Palestinian gunmen and occupation forces at the compound, in addition to other provocation acts, “is undermining peace efforts, and invites further violence. ‘‘ Tarawneh highlighted the importance of finding a solution to the Palestinian issue and establishing an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital; stressing that the world will suffer further violence and terrorism without solving this issue.

The foreign ministries of Turkey and Israel are trading barbs over the Temple Mount crisis. Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Huseyin Muftuoglu on Wednesday accuses Israel of making “arrogant” statements after the country’s foreign ministry called remarks by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan a day earlier “delusional, baseless and distorted.” In an emailed statement, Muftuoglu “condemned” the Israeli ministry’s comments and calls on Israel to fulfill its responsibilities by “acting with good sense, restoring the status quo (at the holy site) and lifting all hurdles to the freedom of worship.” Mufuoglu says: “Trying to cover up the fact that East Jerusalem is under occupation will not serve peace and stability in the region or the resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.” On Tuesday, Erdogan accused Israel of using security measures as a pretext to take over holy sites in Jerusalem from Muslims. — AP

King Salman of Saudi Arabia contacted US President Donald Trump concerning the Temple Mount crisis in Jerusalem and urged the American leader to ensure that Muslims are able to pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque without restrictions, the Saudi court said Thursday in a statement. The announcement came after a tense standoff focused on the Temple Mount appeared to be have been resolved, when the Israel Police removed recently installed security measures that had angered Muslims and Palestinians. Muslims had been refusing to enter the site since Israel installed security equipment, including metal detectors and cameras, two days after a July 14 attack in which three Arab Israelis used guns smuggled into the sacred compound to kill two Israeli policemen. Deadly unrest erupted with the introduction of the new measures, with clashes breaking out around the compound and in the West Bank, leaving five Palestinians dead. A Palestinian also broke into a home in a settlement in the West Bank last week and stabbed four members of the Salomon family, killing three of them. After Israeli police said early Thursday that all the new security measures had been removed, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas issued a statement calling for prayer services to be reinstated in the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The call was echoed by Jerusalem’s Muslim religious authorities, which urged worshipers to pray on the Mount rather than at their local mosques. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The Saudi royal court said that Salman had been in contact with Trump and asked him to ensure that Muslims would be able to pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque not be closed, the Saudi-owned news site Al-Arabiya reported. The king, who is also custodian of the mosques of Mecca and Medina in his kingdom, also asked Trump to see to the abolition of restrictions on access to the Al-Aqsa mosque, the statement said. Salman’s efforts were successful and contributed to the restoration of stability as well as preserving the dignity and security of the worshipers, the court said. Advertisement The statement also stressed Saudi Arabia’s belief in the importance of achieving a comprehensive peace for the Palestinian cause as laid out in the Arab Peace Initiative, a plan of Saudi origin that is based on a two-state solution. At the height of the crisis, Trump dispatched his special envoy Jason Greenblatt to Israel, where he held meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian officials in Jerusalem. Greenblatt also traveled to Jordan for a meeting with that country’s foreign minister. The tense two-week standoff between Israel and Muslim worshipers at the holy site persisted despite the removal of metal detectors on Tuesday, sparking concerns of major unrest surrounding Friday prayers. Muslims were refusing to enter the site and have been praying in the streets outside since Israel implemented the measures. Palestinians said they viewed the move as Israel asserting further control. Israeli authorities said the metal detectors were needed because the July 14 attackers smuggled guns into the compound and emerged from it to attack the officers. The Temple Mount is the holiest site in Judaism and is revered as the site of the biblical temples. It is also the third-holiest site in Islam, after Mecca and Medina, and is known to Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif. Under an arrangement in place since Israel captured the Old City in the Six Day War in 1967 and extended its sovereignty there, non-Muslims are allowed access to the site but are forbidden to pray there. Under that status quo, Israel is responsible for security at the site while the Jordanian trust — the Waqf — is in charge of administrative duties. Advertisement During a visit to the region in May that included Saudi Arabia and Israel, Trump asserted that peace between Israel and the Palestinians would be part of wider regional cooperation among moderate Sunni states in which Saudi Arabia would be a key element. AFP and Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.

News article:
WASHINGTON — US President Donald Trump and King Abdullah II of Jordan spoke by phone Friday about the crisis in recent weeks surrounding the Temple Mount, the Royal Hashemite Court announced. A statement in Jordanian state media said the king thanked Trump for his administration’s role in helping to defuse tensions and stressed the importance of deepening US-Jordan ties “to avoid the recurrence of such crises.” The call marks the first time Trump has personally injected himself into the crisis that has spurred violent protests, deep tension between Israel and the Palestinians, and a diplomatic imbroglio between Israel and Jordan. “Both leaders said they were encouraged by the efforts taken to de-escalate tensions and by the progress that has been made,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. “They pledged to continue to stay in close communication. President Trump also emphasized Jordan’s important role in regional security.” Jordan, the custodian of the Temple Mount, and the Palestinians pressured Israel to remove security measures at entrances to the sensitive holy compound, which houses the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock sanctuary. These were set up after a July 14 terror attack in which three Arab Israelis shot dead two Israeli police officers with weapons they had smuggled onto the site. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The introduction of the new Israeli security measures, including metal detectors and cameras, set off near-daily clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli security forces in and around the Old City, East Jerusalem and the West Bank. It also triggered a boycott by Muslim worshipers who threatened not to return to the site until all the installations were removed. Israel removed the new measures early Thursday, and Muslim worshipers returned to pray at the compound later that day. Friday prayers at the site ended peacefully. Last week, five Palestinians died in weekend clashes and a Palestinian terrorist killed three members of a family sitting down to Shabbat dinner in the West Bank settlement of Halamish. Advertisement A diplomatic dispute also erupted between Israel and Jordan this week after the killing of two Jordanians by an Israeli security guard near the Israeli embassy in Amman, including a teenager who had stabbed the security officer in what the Foreign Ministry said was a nationalistically motivated attack. Jordan had demanded the guard be questioned by its security forces, but Israel refused to hand him over, citing his diplomatic immunity. Only after US intervention did Amman relent, allowing the guard and the rest of the embassy staff to leave Jordan. Following their return on Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked the Jordanian monarch and the US president for their efforts in securing the staff’s safe passage back into Israel. Jordan, however, was angered by Netanyahu’s warm welcome of the guard, who has been named only as Ziv, with the king calling for him to be tried. Abdullah accused Netanyahu of “political showmanship” and of using “this crime to score personal political points,” after the Israeli leader posted photos of himself embracing the guard. The monarch said this episode would have a negative impact on bilateral ties between Amman and Jerusalem. On Thursday, Jordan charged the guard with murder in absentia. It went on to say the Israel embassy staff would not be allowed to return until a proper investigation was conducted. On Friday, Jordan gave Israel the results of its investigation into the shooting, and called for the guard to be prosecuted under international law. Advertisement Later on Friday, Israel announced it was opening a probe into the incident. While Trump sent one of his top envoys, Jason Greenblatt, to the region earlier this week to try to reduce tensions, he himself has not yet spoken to either Netanyahu or Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Greenblatt, for his part, met with Netanyahu and US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman in Jerusalem on Monday before heading to Amman for more meetings on Tuesday. A senior administration official told The Times of Israel that “President Trump and his administration are closely following unfolding events in the region,” and praised Netanyahu for his handling of the situation and said the White House team had been working with him. “In our continuous contacts with him throughout the crisis, Prime Minister Netanyahu acted with a clear sense of responsibility not just for Israel’s security, but also for regional stability,” the official said. In another statement Thursday, Greenblatt said the US welcomed the efforts to restore calm, saying he hoped it would help renew an opening for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks — which Trump has made a major priority as president, saying he intends to achieve the “ultimate deal.” “The United States welcomes the efforts undertaken to de-escalate tensions in Jerusalem today,” he said. “We believe that calm and security will create the best opportunity to return to dialogue and the pursuit of peace.” The fate of the Temple Mount is an emotional issue at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Even the smallest perceived change to delicate arrangements pertaining to the site sparks tensions. Advertisement Jews revere the hilltop compound as the Temple Mount, site of the two Jewish biblical temples. It is the holiest site in Judaism, and the nearby Western Wall, a remnant of one of the temples, is the holiest place where Jews can pray. But the walled compound is also home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, which is Islam’s third-holiest site after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. Muslims believe the site marks the spot where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven.

His Majesty King Abdullah meets with editors-in-chief of local newspapers, journalists, and the president of the Jordan Press Association at Al Husseiniya Palace on Saturday (Photo courtesy of Royal Court) AMMAN — His Majesty King Abdullah on Saturday met with a group of journalists, including the editors-in-chief of local newspapers, columnists and the president of the Jordan Press Association, a Royal Court statement said. During the meeting, at Al Husseiniya Palace, the King discussed the latest crisis of Al Aqsa Mosque/ Al Haram Al Sharif, the efforts to reopen the shrine, restoring calm and ensuring respect of the historical and legal status quo of the holy compound. His Majesty praised the persistence and determination of Jerusalemites, stressing the unified Jordanian-Palestinian stand in dealing with the crisis. The King highlighted the role of the Islamic Awqaf Department in Jerusalem, which is affiliated with Jordan’s Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs, describing it as a key contributor to restoring calm, according to the statement. He said that the Palestinian issue and Jerusalem are the first priority for Jordan, which will continue honouring its historical role in protecting the Muslim and Christian holy places in Jerusalem. On all occasions, the King said, he promotes the Palestinian cause and the need to protect Jerusalem in all his international activities, stressing that there is no party that advocates the cause more earnestly than Jordan, as “we carry out our historical, political and legal responsibilities and stand against Judaisation of the holy shrines despite the magnitude and the complexity of challenges," the King said. He stressed the importance of coordination among all stakeholders to ensure the preservation of the status quo. As for the Israeli embassy incident in Amman, in which two Jordanians were killed, the Monarch reiterated that Jordan will not give up on the rights of Jordanians, adding that the Kingdom will devote all efforts to make sure that justice is served. “I wonder about the absence of former officials, who have had no voice at the time of crises,’’ King Abdullah said. The meeting also touched on the ceasefire agreement in the south of Syria, which has been recently reached by Jordan, the US and Russia. “The features of the conflict have become clearer and there are positive signs,” His Majesty said. He said that he is optimistic about the situation in Iraq and reopening its border crossing with Jordan this year. During the meeting, various other local and regional issues were discussed, such as the expected objective and professional media performance, the importance of improving media tools, especially social media, to be up-to-date to ensure swift news delivery to ultimately enhance trust between citizens and institutions. In this regard, His Majesty said that doubting the military and security agencies is not acceptable and nobody will be allowed to be “louder” than those institutions, adding that the armed forces are also a “red line”. For their part, the meeting’s attendees highlighted the role of Jordan, under His Majesty’s leadership, in solving the mosque’s crisis, appreciating the King’s keenness on protecting the rights of Jordanians.

The meeting also touched on the ceasefire agreement in the south of Syria, which has been recently reached by Jordan, the US and Russia. “The features of the conflict have become clearer and there are positive signs,” His Majesty said. He said that he is optimistic about the situation in Iraq and reopening its border crossing with Jordan this year. During the meeting, various other local and regional issues were discussed, such as the expected objective and professional media performance, the importance of improving media tools, especially social media, to be up-to-date to ensure swift news delivery to ultimately enhance trust between citizens and institutions. In this regard, His Majesty said that doubting the military and security agencies is not acceptable and nobody will be allowed to be “louder” than those institutions, adding that the armed forces are also a “red line”. For their part, the meeting’s attendees highlighted the role of Jordan, under His Majesty’s leadership, in solving the mosque’s crisis, appreciating the King’s keenness on protecting the rights of Jordanians.

Jordan’s King Abdullah II is planning a rare state visit to the Palestinian Authority next week, sources in Amman and Ramallah said Thursday. Palestinian, Israeli and Jordanian officials are in the final stages of talks over the visit to meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, according to Israeli news site Ynet. The meeting is slated to last just a few hours, according to the report. A source in PA President Mahmoud Abbas’s office confirmed the visit would take place Monday. This would mark the first time in five years that the king has visited the Palestinian Authority, coming on the heels of a high-stakes standoff over metal detectors and other security measures at Jerusalem’s Temple Mount and strained diplomatic ties between Israel and Amman.

A spokesperson for Israel’s Foreign Ministry said he was unaware of the trip. Jordan was a key player in efforts to calm tensions after Israel installed security measures at the Temple Mount following a July 14 terror attack there in which three Arab Israelis shot dead two police officers using guns they had smuggled into the holy site. The new Israeli measures prompted the Waqf Islamic Trust that administers the site to announce a boycott that devolved into nightly clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces.

Abdullah also said Wednesday that Jordan was continuing to push for the prosecution of an Israeli embassy guard who killed two Jordanians during the height of tensions last month. Israel says the guard was assaulted by one of the Jordanians in a suspected nationalistic attack. After Netanyahu warmly greeted the guard upon his return to Israel, Abdullah said there would be diplomatic consequences. Jordan, which considers itself a custodian of Jerusalem holy sites, was seen as playing a key role in lowering tensions, releasing the guard to Israel at the same time as Israel removed the metal detectors. Israel later rolled back other security measures as well, after almost two weeks of violent protests in Jerusalem and the West Bank. On Saturday the 82-year-old Abbas was hospitalized, suffering from what doctors and officials described as “exhaustion.” On Sunday Abdullah phoned Abbas to wish him well.

News article:
Jordan's King Abdullah II is scheduled to visit the Palestinian Authority on Monday to meet with President Mahmoud Abbas. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Fatah leadership member Mohammad Shtayyeh said this was "a visit of solidarity and coordination, which proves the Palestinians and Jordanians speak with one voice." He was referring to the shared positions with regards to the Temple Mount as well as the American efforts to restart the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Abbas and King Abdullah meet in Amman (Photo: Reuters) Jordanian officials told the newspaper Ad-Dustour that Abdullah and Abbas will discuss diplomatic issues relating, among others, to the developments at the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The officials said the king will be accompanied by several senior Jordanian officials. Abdullah will first meet with Abbas privately at the latter's office and later hold an extended meeting including the king's entourage and Palestinian officials. "The king wants to emphasize his support and his aid to the Palestinian president and the Palestinian people, and his and the Jordanian people's stance beside the Palestinian people and their leadership," one of the officials explained the purpose of the visit. The King's last visit to the Palestinian territories took place five years ago. The timing of the expected visit is as important as the visit itself. Abdullah's arrival at the present time is expected to give Abbas political support in a time when relations between Israel and the PA deteriorated due to Abbas' decision to sever ties with Israel, including security coordination. The fact that Abdullah will arrive in Ramallah shortly after the incident in Amman—in which an Israeli security guard shot two Jordanian civilians—and after the Temple Mount crisis, two events that brought Israel-Jordan relations to a record low, constitutes a clear and meaningful statement to Israel. Violent clashes at the Temple Mount (צילום: רויטרס, אסף מגל) X Earlier this week, King Abdullah ordered to allocate over $1.4 million to the Islamic Waqf at the Temple Mount to develop the Islamic museum located at the compound. Abdullah's visit also comes amid growing pessimism in the PA with regards to the Trump administration's ability to restart peace talks, this following the cautious optimism the Palestinian leadership displayed in the first few months of the US president's term. Earlier this week, Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner, entrusted among other things with promoting the Middle East peace process, said in off-the-record remarks that were leaked that t here may not be a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Meanwhile, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat criticized the American administration for having yet to express support of the two-state solution and for failing to condemn Israeli construction in the West Bank.

His Majesty King Abdullah speaks during a meeting with House leaders in Amman on Sunday (Photo courtesy of Royal Court) AMMAN — His Majesty King Abdullah on Sunday thanked lawmakers for their efforts during the extraordinary session, a Royal Court statement said. During the session, the House endorsed a number of legislations to improve the judicial system, after the government made changes to or introduced 16 laws, responding to recommendations by the Royal Committee for Developing the Judiciary and Enhancing the Rule of Law. At a meeting with Lower House Speaker Atef Tarawneh, members of the House Permanent Bureau and heads of committees, His Majesty stressed the importance of coordination between the Chamber and the government. The legislative performance during the last session was within the expected level, the King said, stressing that improving the performance of committees serves the overall mission of the legislature. During the meeting, held at Al Husseiniya Palace, His Majesty pointed out the significance of the upcoming municipal and local governorate councils elections, slated for August 15. He said the polls will ensure people’s involvement in decision making concerning developmental priorities through electing governorate councils. Meanwhile, King Abdullah outlined the challenges currently faced regarding the Palestinian cause and Jerusalem. In this regard, the Monarch said there would be no breakthrough in the peace process without a US push for a solution. He stressed that without the Hashemite Custodianship of Jerusalem’s holy places and support for Jerusalemites, the shrines "would have been lost years ago". The future of the Palestinian cause is at stake and applying solutions is becoming increasingly difficult. The King and the MPs also discussed the assault against a police patrol in Maan, 220km south of Amman, on Saturday. His Majesty stressed the importance of observing the rule of law and applying it to all indiscriminately. Security agencies, he reiterated, are “ a red-line” that should not be crossed. “All have to look at Jordan as one tribe; Jordan is my tribe”, the King concluded.

News article:
Jordan’s king flew by helicopter to the West Bank on Monday for a rare visit seen as a signal to Israel that he is closing ranks with the Palestinians on key issues, such as the contested Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. Abdullah II met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah in his first visit to the West Bank in five years. Palestinian officials said the Jordanian ruler and PA president were slated to discuss efforts to revive the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, stalled since 2014. The meeting lasted approximately two hours. Abdullah returned to Jordan immediately after the meeting. No official statements were released. “The future of the Palestinian issue is at stake and reaching a solution is becoming more difficult,” Abdullah had said Sunday during a meeting with the speaker of the Jordanian parliament and heads of parliamentary committees. “There will be no breakthrough in the peace process if there is no American commitment to support a solution to the Palestinian issue.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The monarch’s visit came after a spike in Jordanian-Israeli tensions over the Temple Mount, which is holy to both Jews and Muslims, and a deadly shooting incident involving an Israeli embassy guard in Amman. Abdullah wa not scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during the trip. “Were it not for Hashemite guardianship and the steadfastness of Jerusalemites, the holy sites would have been lost years ago,” the king said Sunday. “Our success requires a unified position with our Palestinian brethren so that our cause will not be weakened and we can preserve our rights.” A July 14 terror attack on the Mount, in which three Arab Israelis shot dead two police officers using guns they had smuggled into the holy site, prompted Israel to install metal detectors and other security measures there. The new Israeli measures prompted the Waqf Islamic trust, which administers the site on behalf of Jordan, to announce a boycott that devolved into nightly clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces. Advertisement The strain in ties between Israel and Jordan was exacerbated by an incident that saw an Israeli guard at the embassy compound in Amman shoot dead two Jordanian men, one of whom had attacked him with a screwdriver. Jordan was seen as playing a central role in resolving the Temple Mount standoff by releasing the guard to Israel, which then removed the metal detectors. Israel later rolled back other security measures as well amid massive Arab pressure, after almost two weeks of violent protests in Jerusalem and the West Bank. When Netanyahu warmly greeted the guard upon his return to Israel, Abdullah said there would be diplomatic consequences. The king also said last week that Jordan was continuing to push for the prosecution of the guard. Abdullah’s role as Muslim custodian of the Jerusalem shrine is a key component of his legitimacy. Last week he announced that he would donate 1 million Jordanian dinars ($1.4 million) to the Waqf, which is funded by Amman. Dov Lieber contributed to this report.

No official statements were released. “The future of the Palestinian issue is at stake and reaching a solution is becoming more difficult,” Abdullah had said Sunday during a meeting with the speaker of the Jordanian parliament and heads of parliamentary committees. “There will be no breakthrough in the peace process if there is no American commitment to support a solution to the Palestinian issue.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The monarch’s visit came after a spike in Jordanian-Israeli tensions over the Temple Mount, which is holy to both Jews and Muslims, and a deadly shooting incident involving an Israeli embassy guard in Amman. Abdullah wa not scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during the trip. “Were it not for Hashemite guardianship and the steadfastness of Jerusalemites, the holy sites would have been lost years ago,” the king said Sunday. “Our success requires a unified position with our Palestinian brethren so that our cause will not be weakened and we can preserve our rights.” A July 14 terror attack on the Mount, in which three Arab Israelis shot dead two police officers using guns they had smuggled into the holy site, prompted Israel to install metal detectors and other security measures there. The new Israeli measures prompted the Waqf Islamic trust, which administers the site on behalf of Jordan, to announce a boycott that devolved into nightly clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces. Advertisement The strain in ties between Israel and Jordan was exacerbated by an incident that saw an Israeli guard at the embassy compound in Amman shoot dead two Jordanian men, one of whom had attacked him with a screwdriver. Jordan was seen as playing a central role in resolving the Temple Mount standoff by releasing the guard to Israel, which then removed the metal detectors. Israel later rolled back other security measures as well amid massive Arab pressure, after almost two weeks of violent protests in Jerusalem and the West Bank. When Netanyahu warmly greeted the guard upon his return to Israel, Abdullah said there would be diplomatic consequences. The king also said last week that Jordan was continuing to push for the prosecution of the guard. Abdullah’s role as Muslim custodian of the Jerusalem shrine is a key component of his legitimacy. Last week he announced that he would donate 1 million Jordanian dinars ($1.4 million) to the Waqf, which is funded by Amman. Dov Lieber contributed to this report.

News article:
Ramallah (Palestinian Territories) (AFP) - Jordan's King Abdullah II offered support to Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas during a rare visit Monday to the occupied West Bank following tensions with Israel over a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site. Abdullah's first trip to the West Bank in five years was seen as a message to Israel and the United States over the sensitive Al-Aqsa mosque compound and the stalled peace process. It came less than two weeks after the end of a standoff at the holy site over new security measures, including metal detectors, imposed by Israel following an attack that killed two policemen. Abdullah stressed to Abbas "the full Jordanian support for the legitimate rights of its brothers the Palestinian people and support for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with its capital in east Jerusalem", a statement from Jordan's royal palace said. He backed the need to protect Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound, warning Israeli attempts to change the status quo -- under which Jordan is custodian of the site and Jewish prayer is forbidden -- "would have negative consequences for the whole region". The Al-Aqsa compound is also holy to Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount as it is believed to be on the site of the first and second Jewish Temples, the latter of which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD. Abdullah also "called for the commitment of US President Donald Trump to work to realise peace between Palestinians and Israelis". The king flew by helicopter to Ramallah and a red carpet welcome from Abbas. He returned to Jordan after a meeting that lasted around an hour and a half. The king did not meet any Israeli officials. Jordan reacted angrily last month to the new security measures at the mosque compound, which sparked several days of protests and clashes in Jerusalem's Old City, the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Palestinian foreign minister Riyad al-Malki told reporters that Abbas and Abdullah on Monday discussed "direct Israeli attacks on the Al-Aqsa mosque". Story continues Tensions were exacerbated on July 23 when an Israeli security guard shot dead two Jordanians at the Israeli embassy compound in Amman. One of the two men attacked the Israeli with a screwdriver, and the other was apparently shot dead by accident, Israeli officials said. The crisis eased on July 27 when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the removal of the metal detectors. He has also promised to investigate the embassy incident. Abdullah's visit was seen by analysts as a show of support for Abbas, who has been isolated by Israel over his response to the Al-Aqsa row. - 'Jerusalem is victorious' - The mosque compound is in east Jerusalem, occupied by Israel in 1967 in a move never recognised by the international community. The 1994 peace treaty between Israel and Jordan recognises Amman's special status as official custodian of Jerusalem's holy Muslim sites. About half of Jordan's 9.5 million citizens are of Palestinian origin. Netanyahu's removal of the metal detectors was seen by Palestinians as a victory. At Abbas's headquarters a large banner displayed a picture of the Al-Aqsa compound with the slogan "Jerusalem is victorious". "It appears that King Abdullah wants to show through his visit that he stands with the Palestinian people in the battle for Jerusalem," Palestinian political analyst Abdel Majid Sweilem told AFP. In a statement on the official state news agency Petra, the king was quoted as saying that without Jordanian "custodianship and the steadfastness of the Jerusalemites, the holy sites would have been lost many years ago". During the crisis over the metal detectors, 82-year-old Abbas suspended security coordination with Israel, and this has remained suspended despite their removal. The decision sparked Israeli anger, with accusations he was encouraging violence. "This visit sends a message from his majesty that he is willing to contribute to removing president Abbas's isolation following his decision to stop the security coordination with Israel," Samir Awad, politics professor at Birzeit University near Ramallah in the West Bank, told AFP. In January, US President Donald Trump came to power promising to push Israelis and Palestinians towards a peace deal, raising brief hopes among Palestinians that his unconventional approach could achieve results. But Palestinians have become increasingly frustrated by what they see as his negotiating team's one-sided approach. Trump's team has yet to publicly commit to the two-state solution, the idea of an independent Palestinian state next to Israel that has been the basis of decades of international consensus. Malki said Abbas and Abdullah had agreed that for any political process to move forward "there must be recognition of the principle of a two-state solution".

News article:
RAMALLAH (Reuters) — Jordan’s King Abdullah II met Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah on Monday for the first time in five years to discuss tensions at Har HaBayis and broader political developments. While the two leaders meet fairly frequently in Amman and other regional capitals, Abdullah has not visited Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, since December 2012. The king flew in by helicopter. The visit was coordinated with Israeli authorities. It comes two weeks after a surge in violence in Yerushalayim following the killing of two Israeli policemen on Har HaBayis and the subsequent increase in security at the site, with the installation of metal detectors. The change in security led to days of protests and clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces, before Israel, after consultations with Jordan, decided to remove the metal detectors and other measures. “The visit comes in the course of continued consultation and coordination on all levels,” said Nabil Abu Rudainah, Abbas’s spokesman. Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and has growing, if little-discussed, economic ties with its neighbor, often plays a mediating role in the region. “We discussed all issues of mutual interest and we agreed to form a crisis committee that will continue contacts to evaluate what has happened, the lessons to be learned and the challenges we may face at Al-Aqsa mosque,” Palestinian Foreign Minister Reyad Al-Maliki told reporters after the meeting. President Donald Trump’s regional envoy, Jason Greenblatt, has made several trips to Amman, Ramallah and Yerushalayim this year to try to find common ground, but there is little sign of enthusiasm on anyone’s part to start negotiating again. Abdullah is also playing a role in liaising with Egypt and others to see if long-standing differences between Abbas’s Western-backed Fatah party and the rival Hamas Islamist movement can be resolved. Hamas, which won the last parliamentary elections held in the Palestinian territories in 2005, seized full control of Gaza after a struggle with Fatah in 2007. Over the past several months, Abbas, as head of the Palestinian Authority, has stepped up pressure on Hamas, cutting off salaries for civil servants in Gaza and limiting payments for electricity imports and some medicines. The aim appears to be to oust Hamas from power, but there is little sign of that happening. Efforts are being made by regional powers to resolve the internal fighting.

Jordan’s King Abdullah II said on Sunday there will be no breakthrough in the peace process between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) if there is no U.S. commitment to supporting a solution to the “Palestinian issue”. "Without the Hashemite custodianship and the steadfastness of the Jerusalemites, the holy sites would have been lost many years ago. Our success requires one to stand with the Palestinian brothers, so that our cause wouldn't be weakened and our rights would be maintained," he told members of the Lower House of Parliament, according to a report in the official Petra news agency. The King warned that the future of the Palestinian issue is at stake and reaching a solution is becoming even more difficult. In this context, he called for more efforts and intensive work with the U.S. administration to make the necessary progress. King Abdullah’s comments came ahead of a rare visit he will make to Ramallah this week, where he will meet Palestinian Authority (PA) chairman Mahmoud Abbas. Earlier on Sunday, the Arabic newspaper Rai al-Youm reported that Jordan is preparing to advance several diplomatic steps against the Jewish state amid tensions in ties over the recent incident near the Israeli embassy in Amman, in which an Israeli security guard shot two Jordanian civilians. Following the attack, Jordanian officials demanded Israel turn over the security officer for interrogation despite his diplomatic immunity, before King Abdullah and Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu reached a deal which allowed for the guard to return to Israel. On Friday, the Israel Police said it would conduct an "examination" into the fatal shooting. Also on Friday, dozens of demonstrators took to the streets of Amman to demand the closure of the Israeli embassy.

Ramallah: Jordan’s King Abdullah will met Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Monday for the first time in five years to discuss tensions at the Muslim holy site of Al Haram Al Sharif in Occupied and wider political developments. While the two leaders meet fairly frequently in Amman and other regional capitals, Abdullah has not visited Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, since December 2012. The king flew in by helicopter—thevisit was coordinated with Israeli authorities which control all entrance and exit points to the West Bank, including its 150 km border with Jordan and the air space above. Palestinian officials provided little detail on what Abbas and Abdullah would discuss, but said the situation at Al Aqsa and broader political concerns would be touched on. “The visit comes in the course of continued consultation and coordination on all levels,” said Nabil Abu Rudainah, Abbas’s spokesman. “They will also evaluate the current incidents happening in Jerusalem and in particular what happened at Al Aqsa mosque and the efforts exerted to resolve the crisis.” Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and a large percentage of Jordan’s population is made up of Palestinians who fled from a Israeli assault in the 1967 War. Jordan shares a border with the Occupied West Bank, which the Palestinians want for their own state together with East Jerusalem and Gaza. Abbas and Abdullah are also likely to discuss US-led efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have been suspended for the past three years. President Donald Trump’s regional envoy, Jason Greenblatt, has made several trips to Amman, Ramallah and Occupied Jerusalem this year to try to find common ground, but there is little sign of progress. Abdullah’s visit comes two weeks after sizzling tensions surrounding Al Haram Al Sharif. On July 14, following a shoot-out around Al Haram Al Sharif, occupation forces closed off the holy shrine under the pretext of security and prevented Muslims from performing Friday prayers there for the first time since the occupation of Jerusalem. Two days later, the occupation reopened the holy site but Muslim worshippers were outraged to find they had to enter their holy shrine through metal detectors. Palestinians refused to enter Al Haram Al Sharif and staged peaceful street demonstrations and held daily prayers outside Al Haram Al Sharif in the following days. Under massive pressure, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was forced to remove the metal detectors and smart cameras the occupation forces had installed at the entrances of the site. Jews are allowed to visit Al Haram Al Sharif, but not perform religious rituals there, according to a long-standing status quo agreement. Attempts by Israel’s regime to change the status quo have led to escalating violence and tensions which have claimed the lives of over 210 Palestinians and 33 Israelis. Israel’s regime took over Al Haram Al Sharif and the entire eastern part of Jerusalem and annexed it during the 1967 Middle East war, but left the Jordanian Waqf Department to administer and run the Muslim holy sites in a historic status quo agreement which governs access to the holy shrine. Ongoing incursions by Jews on Al Haram Al Sharif premises have been the largest instigator of violence since last year. Palestinians say the Israeli regime is encouraging its citizens to violate the status quo agreement in an effort to change the facts on the ground and erase all Palestinian and Muslim identity from occupied Jerusalem. Al Haram Al Sharif is built on top of the ancient remnants of the Temple Mount, a site sacred in Judaism, but was destroyed in the 4th century by the Romans, during their rule. Al Haram Al Sharif site houses both Al Aqsa Mosque which was originally commissioned to be built under Omar, the second Caliph in Islam in the 7th century, and the Dome of the Rock which houses the rock from which Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) ascended to heaven, according to Islamic teachings.

News article:
JERUSALEM (JTA) — Jordan’s King Abdullah visited Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah for the first time in nearly five years. The two leaders in their West Bank meeting reportedly discussed President Donald Trump and the peace process, as well as the recent crisis over the Temple Mount. Abdullah has not visited Ramallah, the capital of the Palestinian Authority, since December 2012. Abdullah reportedly told Abbas that Trump is committed to brokering peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and “stressed the importance of intensifying efforts to create real political prospects for progress toward resolving the conflict,” the Jordanian government’s Petra News Agency reported. Both the king and Abbas emphasized “the need to preserve the historical and legal status quo” of the Temple Mount, which Petra called the Al-Quds Al-Sharif. Abdullah reiterated that the Hashemite Kingdom would continue to take seriously its guardianship of Muslim holy sites in the city and involve the international community, according to the report. Abbas reportedly praised Abdullah for his efforts to defuse the recent Temple Mount crisis. The two sides agreed to form a joint task force that would study the crisis, which was sparked by the murder of two Druze-Israeli police officers by three Arab-Israeli visitors to the site, and to prepare for possible future conflict at the Temple Mount. Abdullah flew into Ramallah by helicopter, which required coordination with Israeli authorities, but did not meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The failure to meet was meant to show the king’s unhappiness with Netanyahu in the wake of the Temple Mount crisis and the incident late last month in which an Israeli security guard from the Israeli Embassy shot and killed two Jordanian civilians after he was stabbed by one of them — a teen who was installing furniture in an apartment used by the embassy.

News article:
Jordanian national outrage over last month’s embassy killings was never mentioned as the motivation behind King Abdullah’s brief visit to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah. While the public goal of his visit was to check on Abbas and show support for Palestinians and the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the real message of the short helicopter trip was aimed at the Jordanian people and Israel. Thousands of Jordanians heard Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s congratulatory phone call to the embassy security guard who killed two Jordanians moments after he left the country amid a 24-hour diplomatic crisis. They read the Arabic-language transcript of the officially released conversation, in which the Israeli prime minister tells him to enjoy his date that night with his girlfriend. The recording and translation spread like wildfire on WhatsApp, angering Jordanians who felt that their government betrayed the blood of two Jordanian citizens for political gain. The humiliation continued later that night, when broadcasts showed Netanyahu hugging the killer of the Jordanians and congratulating him “for keeping his cool.” Israel not only humiliated Jordanians but appeared to be stabbing King Abdullah and the Jordanian government in the back by not following up on the Vienna Protocol, which requires Israel to pursue criminal investigation when a person with diplomatic immunity commits a crime in a foreign country. While Jordan is a monarchy, the king only governs through his government. In this instance, most Jordanians believe the government was strongly encouraged to act. The pressures from Israel and the White House’s Jared Kushner to quickly release the Israeli security guard – despite his alleged criminal actions – have become public knowledge in the kingdom, leaving Abdullah vulnerable in the eyes of his people. Jordanians who remember the 2014 King Hussein [Allenby] Bridge incident, in which an Israeli guard killed Jordanian judge Raed Zeiter, note that a supposed joint committee is still investigating that incident. Callers on popular talk radio shows in Amman were quick to say that justice has yet to be served in the case of the slain judge, adding they need more proof that the king intends to pursue justice in this new case. The beloved King Abdullah is currently facing a level of public anger he has never encountered in his 17-year rule. The king was on vacation during the embassy incident, and, amid Israeli and U.S. pressure, cut short his vacation and returned home. He went directly to the slain Jordanians’ homes upon arrival. In a moving meeting with the father of the slain 17-year-old furniture store worker, Abdullah said he will seek justice for the man’s son as if it was his own son. After meeting with the Jordanian foreign minister and convening his National Policies Council, the king had some sharp words for Netanyahu in his initial remarks. “The Israeli prime minister is obliged to commit to his responsibilities and to take the necessary legal actions, which include putting the killer on trial to attain justice, instead of dealing with this crime as a political display with the intent of achieving personal political gains. This sort of antagonistic behavior is rejected on all fronts, and it infuriates all of us.” Upon arriving in Ramallah for his meeting with Abbas, Abdullah focused on supporting the Palestinian president, who has confined himself to the West Bank rather than beg for security clearance to travel abroad. Since cutting short his official trip to China, Abbas met with his top officials, who decided unanimously to halt cooperation and security coordination with Israel. To Jordanians, the king wanted to show full support for Palestinians in their struggle against Israeli attempts to change the status quo at Al-Aqsa. Native Jordanians as well as Jordanians of Palestinian origin spoke in a unified voice on this matter. The king wanted to be on their side. As for Israelis, the king wanted them to know that Jordan supports the Palestinians and that the rapprochement with Israel that has made Israeli-Jordanian peace a warm one is in real danger – not only because of Al-Aqsa, but also because of the way the embassy issue was handled, and due to continued Israeli obstacles to the two-state solution. Abdullah’s visit to Ramallah is his fifth since becoming king and his first in five years. The helicopter of an Arab leader doesn’t usually visit Ramallah or any other location in the occupied Palestinian territories. The entire visit to Ramallah didn’t last more than two hours, but the impact of the visit and the messages it conveyed will echo for a long time.

According to the list of alumni of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, 12 members of the Hashemite Family have graduated from there. These include, in addition to His Majesty King Abdullah and Their Majesties the late King Hussein and the late King Talal. Three princesses and six princes, including HRH Crown Prince Hussein are also among the alumni. It goes without saying that the Royal Hashemite Family has strong ties with Sandhurst. King Hussein had represented Queen Elizabeth II in the 1981 Sovereign's Parade when King Abdullah graduated, while King Abdullah himself represented the queen twice in 2006 and 2017. In addition, a decoration is given in the name of King Hussein to the best non-British cadet who shows the most improvement. At the Sovereign's Parade where the Crown Prince was graduating last Friday, His Majesty gave a relatively short speech, but it was vintage King Abdullah. The speech was peppered with funny remarks, indicating the deep sense of peership he feels towards the cadets. That peership transformed itself into a vertical patriarchal relationship when he began to summarise the lessons he derived from his experience at Sandhurst 36 years ago. The first lesson was “Nothing, nothing will substitute for the quality of your command”; not technology, not financial resources or any other factors. The second lesson is, “indeed, the enduring bonds that began here can help all of you lead the global understanding that a secure and peaceful future requires”. It will be a complex world where camaraderie and personal understanding can help tackle such global complexities and help create a better world for all. The third lesson was to remind the graduates never to give up. “You must now believe in yourself and rise to the challenges ahead.” His Majesty was talking in the first person, disambiguating himself to communicate a noble human a political message. His speech was one from the heart, and aimed at the hearts and minds of his listeners. The King left Ramallah last Monday after delivering many messages to many parties. It was not mere official duty; it came after events that looked every Jordanian squarely in the face and brought with it heaps of leashed and unleashed emotions. Al Aqsa and the holy places in Jerusalem, as well as killing of innocent Jordanians by an Israeli guard are not questions of Royal duty; but they are actually personal, very much personal. To link that with a task like graduating a Sandhurst class with his son makes the King walk the thin line separating the official and the personal. His Majesty walked the walk and talked the talk in his most human persona. Both the Hashemites and Sandhurst are rooted in glorious history and achievements. It is no wonder that both naturally bond.

His Majesty King Abdullah meets with representatives of the Jerusalem Awqaf Department, Jerusalemites and the Palestinian leadership in Amman on Wednesday (Photo courtesy of Royal Court) AMMAN — His Majesty King Abdullah on Wednesday praised Jerusalemites for their steadfastness and defending Al Aqsa Mosque/Al Haram Al Sharif, a Royal Court statement said. During a meeting with representatives of the Jerusalem Awqaf Department, Jerusalemites and Palestinians, His Majesty said that supporting the department is a personal priority and a basic requirement for preserving the holy sites. Earlier this month, King Abdullah, who is the custodian of holy shrines in the Old City of Jerusalem, donated JD1 million to the awqaf department, which is affiliated with Jordan’s Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs and is the authority in charge of managing Al Aqsa Mosque/Al Haram Al Sharif. The funds went to support construction projects and the department’s employees. Under directives by King Abdullah, the number of awqaf employees, including guards, was raised from 300 in 2010 to 800 five years later, while a decision has been taken this year to reinforce the staff with 223 other staffers. The King stressed yesterday that Jordan would continue exerting all possible efforts to defend the Muslim and Christian holy places in Jerusalem, preserving the historical and legal status quo in the city and standing up in the face of any attempts that aim to divide the holy compound, in reference to the Israeli occupation’s reported plans to divide the sanctuary temporally between Muslims and Jews. He noted that, during the recent crisis, it was clear that continued tension in Jerusalem would have regional and international repercussions. His Majesty stressed the importance of direct coordination with the Jerusalemites on developments and challenges, noting that Jordan was in continuous coordination with the Palestinian leadership to solve the recent crisis, which saw Israel closing down the mosque for two days and then installing surveillance cameras and metal detectors before ending all that under pressure. The meeting, which was attended by HRH Prince Ghazi, the King’s personal envoy and religious affairs adviser, touched on the importance of visiting the holy city by Muslims from the world to pray that would further safeguard the mosque and increase support for the Jerusalemites. For their part, the representative expressed appreciation for Jordan’s role, under His Majesty’s leadership, in supporting the resilience of the legitimate residents of the holy city and preserving the Muslim and Christian holy sites, and the efforts Amman exerted to ensure the reopening the compound after the Israel-imposed closure last month. Palestine Grand Mufti Mahmoud Habbash commended the high levels of coordination between Jordan and Palestine, citing His Majesty’s recent visit to Ramallah in support of the Palestinian cause. Habbash, who is also an adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, urged all parties to “stand by Jordan and the Palestinian National Authority”. Sheikh Abdul Azim Salhab, who heads the Jerusalem Awqaf Council, said that without His Majesty’s intervention in Al Aqsa Mosque crisis, “things would have been worse”. Salhab appealed to the King to continue efforts of tackling the challenges faced by the city residents including hindrances and interference in the affairs of the awqaf department by the occupation authorities. Director General of Jerusalem Awqaf and Al Aqsa Affairs Sheikh Azzam Khatib said that the Awqaf Department, supported by 320,000 Jerusalemites, will defend the mosque along with Jordan.

News article:
August 24, 2017 As confidence in Palestinian leadership hits record-low levels, senior PLO officials are again discussing the idea of a Palestinian-Jordanian confederation, made of two independent states. One of these PLO officials told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity that in the latest meeting between Jordanian King Abdullah II and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah on Aug. 7, the two leaders agreed to tighten relations in several domains. The leaders decided to enhance security cooperation against the radical fundamentalist movement out of Iran and Syria and to strengthen economic ties, to support the Palestinian Authority (PA). They also decided to increase police collaboration with Egypt and Saudi Arabia and to cooperate on the Muslim safeguarding of Haram al-Sharif (Temple Mount). The PLO source said that given the domestic situation in the United States, with an administration that is barely viable, it is very unlikely that there will be a viable peace process. “Faced with such a US administration and with [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu’s annexation policies, we are forced to conclude that the Arab sides must act unilaterally in favor of Palestinian statehood," he said. He also claimed that senior Fatah echelons believe this can be achieved either by a violent uprising or by diplomacy. The status quo is untenable. If a violent uprising is chosen as the course of action, there most likely will be an agreement of national unity with Hamas. If diplomacy has the upper hand, ties to Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia will be strengthened and the Palestinian-Jordanian confederation will become an option again. The senior PLO official argued that the Palestinians are more positive than the Jordanians on the concept of confederative ties. "What brought us recently closer was Netanyahu's intrusive security measures on Haram a-Sharif. The greater the cooperation between us and the Jordanians is on the security of Al-Aqsa, the greater the chances are for closer ties between the two sides of the [Jordan] river." The PLO official belongs to a group of Oslo process veterans who have recently crafted a plan that would gradually lead to close ties between the Palestinians and the Jordanians. He explained that as joint protectors of Al-Aqsa, it is in the common interest of the Palestinian and Jordanian leaderships to explore such ties. Also, each side is eager to receive greater US economic assistance — the PA for its nation-building process and Jordan for its severe refugee crisis. According to this plan, a gradual tightening of relations would take place within several spheres. A priority point would be tightening security cooperation between the Jordan Haram al-Sharif Waqf (religious custodian) and the Palestinian Ministry of Religious Affairs. A second point would be strengthening economic cooperation, also on infrastructure such as water, energy and transportation. A third point would be coordinating policies vis-a-vis the United States and the European Union in relation to a two-state solution on the basis of the Arab Peace Initiative. For these to be achieved, the plan establishes regular meetings between the leaders of the two sides and meetings of policy coordination between the two negotiation teams on all permanent-status issues. Obviously, the route to any confederative relationship of this sort would encounter tremendous obstacles, mainly grounded in the demography of Jordan where half of the population is of Palestinian origin. Some Jordanians harbor suspicions that the Palestinian leadership aspires to create one day a "greater Palestine." Yet the current configuration in the international community may bring the parties to at least explore a gradual road map to a confederation between two states, Palestine and Jordan. A senior official from the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity that Israel is aware of those discussions and that the Jordanian king is highly reluctant to get engaged in the resolution of the permanent-status issues. Yet he admitted two things: The first is that the relationship between Abbas and Abdullah are at a high positive point and that closer relations are being discussed between them, including the establishment of new joint crises committees. The second element is that at some point a confederative relationship between the Jordanians and the Palestinians may be put on the table, but only after very measurable progress is made on all permanent-status issues between the Palestinians and Israel. The Israeli diplomat argued that Netanyahu is in full control of the situation regarding the Palestinians and in close coordination with the Donald Trump administration. Be that as it may, the confederative-ties plan must be approached in a broader context. The tumultuous domestic situation in the United States may very well lead to new positions among major regional players. These regional players understand this and are becoming more self-reliant.

Yet he admitted two things: The first is that the relationship between Abbas and Abdullah are at a high positive point and that closer relations are being discussed between them, including the establishment of new joint crises committees. The second element is that at some point a confederative relationship between the Jordanians and the Palestinians may be put on the table, but only after very measurable progress is made on all permanent-status issues between the Palestinians and Israel. The Israeli diplomat argued that Netanyahu is in full control of the situation regarding the Palestinians and in close coordination with the Donald Trump administration. Be that as it may, the confederative-ties plan must be approached in a broader context. The tumultuous domestic situation in the United States may very well lead to new positions among major regional players. These regional players understand this and are becoming more self-reliant.

News article:
August 24, 2017 As confidence in Palestinian leadership hits record-low levels, senior PLO officials are again discussing the idea of a Palestinian-Jordanian confederation, made of two independent states. One of these PLO officials told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity that in the latest meeting between Jordanian King Abdullah II and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah on Aug. 7, the two leaders agreed to tighten relations in several domains. The leaders decided to enhance security cooperation against the radical fundamentalist movement out of Iran and Syria and to strengthen economic ties, to support the Palestinian Authority (PA). They also decided to increase police collaboration with Egypt and Saudi Arabia and to cooperate on the Muslim safeguarding of Haram al-Sharif (Temple Mount). The PLO source said that given the domestic situation in the United States, with an administration that is barely viable, it is very unlikely that there will be a viable peace process. “Faced with such a US administration and with [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu’s annexation policies, we are forced to conclude that the Arab sides must act unilaterally in favor of Palestinian statehood," he said. He also claimed that senior Fatah echelons believe this can be achieved either by a violent uprising or by diplomacy. The status quo is untenable. If a violent uprising is chosen as the course of action, there most likely will be an agreement of national unity with Hamas. If diplomacy has the upper hand, ties to Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia will be strengthened and the Palestinian-Jordanian confederation will become an option again. The senior PLO official argued that the Palestinians are more positive than the Jordanians on the concept of confederative ties. "What brought us recently closer was Netanyahu's intrusive security measures on Haram a-Sharif. The greater the cooperation between us and the Jordanians is on the security of Al-Aqsa, the greater the chances are for closer ties between the two sides of the [Jordan] river." The PLO official belongs to a group of Oslo process veterans who have recently crafted a plan that would gradually lead to close ties between the Palestinians and the Jordanians. He explained that as joint protectors of Al-Aqsa, it is in the common interest of the Palestinian and Jordanian leaderships to explore such ties. Also, each side is eager to receive greater US economic assistance — the PA for its nation-building process and Jordan for its severe refugee crisis. According to this plan, a gradual tightening of relations would take place within several spheres. A priority point would be tightening security cooperation between the Jordan Haram al-Sharif Waqf (religious custodian) and the Palestinian Ministry of Religious Affairs. A second point would be strengthening economic cooperation, also on infrastructure such as water, energy and transportation. A third point would be coordinating policies vis-a-vis the United States and the European Union in relation to a two-state solution on the basis of the Arab Peace Initiative. For these to be achieved, the plan establishes regular meetings between the leaders of the two sides and meetings of policy coordination between the two negotiation teams on all permanent-status issues. Obviously, the route to any confederative relationship of this sort would encounter tremendous obstacles, mainly grounded in the demography of Jordan where half of the population is of Palestinian origin. Some Jordanians harbor suspicions that the Palestinian leadership aspires to create one day a "greater Palestine." Yet the current configuration in the international community may bring the parties to at least explore a gradual road map to a confederation between two states, Palestine and Jordan. A senior official from the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity that Israel is aware of those discussions and that the Jordanian king is highly reluctant to get engaged in the resolution of the permanent-status issues.

News article:
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s visit to Jordan came at a time when Jordan should ensure that it does not drift from its strategic alliances with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain. In Jordan, the Muslim Brotherhood is back on the political scene while the Kingdom’s allies have listed the organisation as a terrorist group. Any perceived support or even lack of opposition to the Brotherhood could send a negative message to Arab countries and be perceived as edging closer to the Turkish government. Turkey’s strategic regional position currently faces several major challenges. One is the developments in Syria, where the US is positioning even closer to the Kurds who demand an autonomous state. Losing position in Syria is one thing, but potential Kurdish independence is a clear territorial threat to Turkey. In addition, Erdogan’s major allies in the Muslim Brotherhood are being targeted by the Arab countries, which increasingly isolates Turkey politically, especially as it supports Qatar. Erdogan is clearly seeking engagement with Jordan to counter the isolation from the rest of the Arab countries. For Jordan, this may be breaking the ice in a traditionally lacklustre relationship with Turkey, but caution should be exercised not to send the wrong message to the Arab allies. Jordan needs to diversify its options, open channels of communication and engage with all key players in the region, including Turkey. It can leverage its strategic position in the region, but it must formulate a clear strategy that outlines what it wants to achieve and where it wants to position itself. Jordan should avoid being isolated politically, so a clear exit strategy from the current political situation is required. It will be challenging to rebuild ties with Syria and Iraq, but that is the key, given the shared borders. The deterioration of relations with Israel is also a serious challenge that must be addressed, as is the relationship with Saudi Arabia. With all the challenges that Jordan faces, what is needed is a new, progressive vision that includes serious changes. Jordan needs a new direction and for that it needs different minds in the political system; new policies require new faces.

News article:
Israel intends to speedily destroy the house of the Palestinian terrorist who killed three members of the Salomon family Friday night in the West Bank settlement of Halamish, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday. On Friday evening, 19-year-old Omar al-Abed, from a nearby West Bank village, burst in to the Salomon family’s house armed with a large knife and stabbed to death Yosef Salomon, 70, his daughter Chaya Salomon, 46, and son Elad Salomon, 36. Yosef’s wife Tova, 68, was seriously hurt. During the attack, Abed was shot and injured by an off-duty Israeli soldier who lives nearby. He was discharged from an Israeli hospital into custody on Saturday. IDF forces early Saturday morning raided Abed’s home and arrested his brother. They also mapped the family home of the 19-year-old killer in preparation for its likely demolition. At the start of the weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu expressed condolences to the Salomon family. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “Yosef, Chaya and Elad were murdered by a human beast infused with the hatred of Jews,” he said. “The security forces are acting in the field at all times as is necessary,” he said. “The house of the lowly terrorist will be demolished as soon as possible. We are taking action against all those who incite to murder and those who glorify it.” The prime minister added that he and his ministers were currently receiving updates and policy recommendations on the situation by all relevant security agencies. Advertisement “We will decide accordingly,” he said, referring to the controversial decision by Israel to place metal detectors at the Temple Mount following a deadly terror attack there on July 14. That attack was carried out by three Arab Israelis who had smuggled firearms into the flashpoint holy site and then launched their shooting attack from within the compound. Two Israeli policemen were killed by the terrorists, who were themselves shot dead as they retreated into the Temple Mount enclosure. Arab leaders have condemned what the termed Israeli “restrictions” at the Temple Mount. Israeli officials insist that the status quo there has not changed, and that all recent measures were taken solely to secure the site. “We operate calmly, with determination and responsibility,” Netanyahu said. “This is how we will continue to act to maintain security.” Four top ministers on Saturday and Sunday called on the West Bank military courts to seek the death penalty for Abed, which has not been exercised in decades. The security cabinet was scheduled to convene later Sunday to review the Temple Mount security measures. A previous meeting on Thursday night decided to leave the metal detectors in place. There have been daily protests against the walk-through metal detectors by Muslim worshipers who refuse to enter the Temple Mount as long as the electronic security equipment remains. Hundreds of worshipers have held prayers sessions in the street outside the Lions Gate to the Old City, scene of the deadly shooting attack, and a key access point to the Temple Mount compound that lies just inside the gate. Advertisement Overnight Saturday-Sunday, Israel installed new security cameras and other surveillance outside Lions Gate. Four Palestinians were killed in East Jerusalem and the West Bank on Friday and Saturday during violent clashes with Israeli security forces over the metal detectors, and a fifth died when a petrol bomb he had planned to hurl at Israeli troops exploded prematurely. In his initial questioning, Abed, the Halamish terrorist, said he bought the knife two days ago and sought to commit a terror attack because of events surrounding the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.

It will be the first eviction in the neighbourhood since 2009, according to Israeli anti-occupation group Peace Now Fahamiya Shamasneh, a 75-year-old Palestinian woman, refuses to pack her things despite a looming deadline for evacuating the home she has lived in for more than 50 years. Israel's supreme court has ruled the family have until Wednesday to vacate the house in annexed east Jerusalem. The family's supporters have no doubt the house will be handed over to Jewish Israelis, as part of a wider plan to boost Jewish settlements in the predominantly Palestinian neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah. It will be the first eviction in the neighbourhood since 2009, according to Israeli anti-occupation group Peace Now, and has become part of a fight over the disputed status of Jerusalem. Israel sees the city as its undivided capital, while the Palestinians want the eastern sector as their future capital. Fahamiya, her sick husband Ayoub, 84, their son and his family have until August 9 to voluntarily leave the cramped,50-square-metre (540-sq-foot) basement of their building or be forced out. "Fifty-three years here means leaving is not easy -- it is a lifetime. I was a young girl when I came to this house," said Fahamiya. "The police are threatening us. We don't know what to do," she said, adding they had not found anywhere else to go. Under a decades-old Israeli law, if Jews can prove their families lived in east Jerusalem homes before the 1948 war that led to the creation of Israel, they can demand that Israel's general custodian office release the property and return their "ownership rights". During the war, thousands of Jews fled Jerusalem as Jordanian-led Arab forces seized the city, while hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled from land that was later to become Israel. No such law exists for Palestinians who lost their land. Israel occupied east Jerusalem in the Six-Day War of 1967 and later annexed it in a move never recognised by the international community. Around 200,000 Israeli Jews now live in east Jerusalem in settlement homes considered illegal under international law. Israel's supreme court has ruled the Shamasneh family have until August 9 to vacate the house in annexed east Jerusalem The Shamasneh family says it has paid 250 shekels ($70) a month to the general custodian since 1967, an arrangement used by the pro-settlers' side as proof that the family recognised their status as tenants. In 2009, the original heirs along with the general custodian launched a legal process to force the family out, but the claimants later sold their rights to a US-registered company, according to Peace Now. The NGO says such companies are often used to make it unclear exactly who is behind the push to evict people, a highly-charged political act. Arye King, director at the Israel Land Fund and a de facto spokesman for much Jewish settlement growth in Jerusalem, denied any legal misconduct. "This house is not changing hands -- it has belonged to Jews for about 90 years and it is returning to the owners after some people rented it," he told AFP. In 2013, Israel's high court rejected an appeal by the family in favour of the claimants, concluding the family were not protected tenants. -'Jewish neighbourhood'- A spokesman for Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas condemned the planned eviction. Fahamiya said they had been told to leave peacefully or they would have to pay the cost of the eviction, about 60-70,000 shekels ($16-19,000). A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas condemned the planned eviction "We will not leave of our own will. Maybe if they force us, carry us and throw us on the streets, then we´ll go. But for us to lock the door and tell them `here are the keys,´ that´s impossible," she said. Peace Now says the house is part of a "larger process the government is undertaking of establishing settlements in Sheikh Jarrah". King, who does not dispute that, said the district is "going back to being a Jewish neighbourhood". "It is happening slowly, slowly but thank God we are succeeding in returning Jews to the place they ran away (from) when the Jordanian legions bombed their houses," he told AFP. Fahamiya laughs at the idea of Jewish heirs, saying she lived there for decades without any mention of any legal owners.

It will be the first eviction in the neighborhood since 2009, according to Israeli anti-occupation group Peace Now, and has become part of a fight over the disputed status of Jerusalem. Israel sees the city as its undivided capital, while the Palestinians want the eastern sector as their future capital. Fahamiya, her sick husband Ayoub, 84, their son and his family have until August 9 to voluntarily leave the cramped,50-square-meter (540-sq-foot) basement of their building or be forced out. "Fifty-three years here means leaving is not easy -- it is a lifetime. I was a young girl when I came to this house," said Fahamiya. "The police are threatening us. We don't know what to do," she said, adding they had not found anywhere else to go. Under a decades-old Israeli law, if Jews can prove their families lived in east Jerusalem homes before the 1948 war that led to the creation of Israel, they can demand that Israel's general custodian office release the property and return their "ownership rights." No such law exists for Palestinians who lost their land. Israel occupied east Jerusalem in the Six-Day War of 1967 and later annexed it in a move never recognized by the international community. Around 200,000 Israeli Jews now live in east Jerusalem in settlement homes considered illegal under international law. The Shamasneh family says it has paid 250 shekels ($70) a month to the general custodian since 1967, an arrangement used by the pro-settlers' side as proof that the family recognized their status as tenants. In 2009, the Israeli settlers along with the general custodian launched a legal process to force the family out, but the claimants later sold their rights to a U.S.-registered company, according to Peace Now. The NGO says such companies are often used to make it unclear exactly who is behind the push to evict people, a highly-charged political act. Arye King, director at the Israel Land Fund and a de facto spokesman for much Jewish settlement growth in Jerusalem, denied any legal misconduct. "This house is not changing hands -- it has belonged to Jews for about 90 years and it is returning to the owners after some people rented it," he told AFP. In 2013, Israel's high court rejected an appeal by the family in favour of the claimants, concluding the family were not protected tenants. A spokesman for Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas condemned the planned eviction. Fahamiya said they had been told to leave peacefully or they would have to pay the cost of the eviction, about 60-70,000 shekels ($16-19,000). "We will not leave of our own will. Maybe if they force us, carry us and throw us on the streets, then we'll go. But for us to lock the door and tell them 'here are the keys,' that's impossible," she said. Peace Now says the house is part of a "larger process the government is undertaking of establishing settlements in Sheikh Jarrah". King, who does not dispute that, said the district is "going back to being a Jewish neighborhood". "It is happening slowly, slowly but thank God we are succeeding in returning Jews to the place they ran away (from) when the Jordanian legions bombed their houses," he told AFP. Fahamiya laughs at the idea of Jewish heirs, saying she lived there for decades without any mention of any legal owners.

News article:
Press TV – Israeli forces have demolished four West Bank homes belonging to the families of the Palestinians allegedly involved in attacks on Israeli forces. In pre-dawn attacks on Thursday, Israeli forces demolished three homes in the villages of Deir Abu Mashaal and one home in Silwad in the Ramallah district, Ma’an reported. The three families in Deir Abu Mashaal had received demolition orders last month after their youths allegedly carried out a deadly attack near Damascus Gate in the Old City of East Jerusalem al-Quds, which left an Israeli police officer dead. Israeli forces shot dead the three Palestinians at the scene. According to local residents, some 50 Israeli military vehicles raided the village, alongside Israeli bulldozers, while Israeli drones were flying above the village. The punitive demolition attack in Deir Abu Mashaal left a total of 22 people homeless, despite the fact that they had not been charged with any wrongdoing, the Palestinian Center for Human Rights said. Israeli forces had imposed a curfew in the village, barring residents from exiting their homes during the demolition in an attempt to avoid clashes. However, head of the village council Imad Zahran said that villagers had gathered at the main streets of the village and near the homes in an attempt to prevent the demolitions. Following the demolitions, clashes erupted in the village, leaving three youths injured. Local resident say Israeli forces fired live ammunition at the protesters. Israeli forces also demolished the home of Malik Hamid in Silwad village. Hamid allegedly killed an Israeli soldier and injured another in a vehicular ramming attack near Israel’s Ofra settlement in April. Following the attacks, Israeli forces detained several family members of the alleged assailants and revoked their Israeli work permits. Rights groups have warned that residents of Deir Abu Mashaal and Silwad have recently faced an escalating wave of “collective punishment” and restrictive measures on a routine basis, including mid-night home raids, arbitrary arrests and installation of roadblocks. Israeli forces raid Palestinian towns, villages, and refugee camps in the West Bank and East Jerusalem al-Quds on a constant basis. UN documentation shows that Israeli forces carried out a weekly average of 95 search and detention raids in 2016. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has backed the punitive home demolitions since tensions escalated across the occupied Palestinian territory in late 2015. In many cases, the Palestinians are forced to demolish their own homes in an attempt to avoid paying hefty demolition costs to Israeli municipal authorities or paying heavy fines and legal costs, which normally end in no useful result but the destruction of the homes anyway. The Israeli work permits of the family members of the alleged assailants have been revoked and family visitation permits of nearly 250,000 Palestinians to enter Jerusalem have been cancelled, B’Tselem said. Israeli authorities also refuse to return the bodies of the slain Palestinians to their families, alleging that funeral ceremonies of the Palestinians killed by Israeli forces incite violence against the regime. This is while Israel continues construction of its illegal settlements across the West Bank, despite the latest UN Security Council resolution against the measure. The Tel Aviv regime has tried to change the demographic makeup of Jerusalem al-Quds over the past decades by constructing settlements, destroying historical sites and expelling the local Palestinian population. Palestinians say the Israeli measures are aimed at paving the way for the Judaization of the city.

Israel’s demolition policy of Palestinian homes as a punitive measure has affected dozens of families, such as this one in Silwad demolished on Thursday to punish the family of a Palestinian alleged to have attacked Israeli soldiers. (WAFA photo/Baha Nasr) With the demolition of three Palestinian homes in the West Bank, on Thursday, and the sealing of a fourth, the total number of homes Israel had demolished or sealed shut since October of 2015, in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, as a punishment to families, has now reached 41, according to the Abdullah Hourani Center for Studies. Center director Suleiman Waari said Israel demolished 36 homes of Palestinians who allegedly attacked and killed Israelis, sealed shut with cement four others and welded shut a fifth after it was impossible to demolish it. He said that 16 homes were for families of Palestinians who are currently in Israeli custody while the rest for families whose sons or daughters were killed. Waari said, according to WAFA, that while Israel is quick to demolish family homes of alleged Palestinian attackers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which is a collective punishment policy, it has not taken any similar action against Israeli Jews who killed Palestinians in terror attacks. He mentioned the murderers of the child Muhammad Abu Khdeir in Jerusalem, who was burnt alive, or the Dawabsha family in Douma, who were also killed after settlers set their home on fire. He said the Israeli courts rejected petitions by the families of the Palestinian victims to demolish the homes of the convicted Jewish terrorists because, they said, demolition of homes is a deterrent policy aimed at Palestinians only.

Scores of Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem performed prayers outside the Shamasna home in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood on Friday in a show of solidarity with the family, who is facing imminent evacuation from their home of 53 years to make room for Israeli settlers claiming they own the family’s home. Ekrima Sabri, head of the High Islamic Committee, said during the Friday khutbah – Islamic sermon – that “the land that the Shamasna family home is built on belongs to the family, and not to Jews.” He said that the Shamasna family had rented the house from its “original owners” since before 1948 – the year Israel was established. However, Sabri’s claims contradict reports that the family patriarch, Ayoub Shamasna, moved into the house in 1964.

News article:
An elderly Palestinian couple have told RT that it's "great injustice" if Israel carries out a decision to evict them and their relatives from the home they have owned in East Jerusalem for over 50 years. The EU is already urging Israel to reconsider the step. The Shamasne family have been living in East Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood since 1964, when the area was under Jordanian rule. When Israel took over East Jerusalem in 1967, nobody claimed the rights to the property. The issue came to light after an Israeli right-leaning settler group, the Israel Land Fund, found the previous owners of the house several years ago. “We lived for 53 years in this house, it is a great injustice. Israel should give us back our land. They take our homes and claim it is theirs,” 76-year-old Fahmiah Shamasne told RT. Under Israeli law, property proven to have been owned by Jews before 1948 can be reclaimed. Four years ago the Shamasnes lost their appeal to the Supreme Court, which ruled that the family must hand over their home. The Palestinians were to leave last week amid police inspections of the building and threats of forceful eviction. The decision has sparked anger among the Arab population of East Jerusalem, who staged prayers outside the house in a show of protest. “The police are threatening us. We don’t know what to do, we are sitting here like fools. We don’t know whether to stay or leave. We have nowhere to go to,” the elderly woman told AFP news agency. She added that her 84-year-old husband will not leave unless he is forced to. “Maybe if we were to find at least a room we could leave. But even if you were to drag out my husband and kick him, he would refuse to go.” Other members of the family also made it clear that they would not give up the place where they spent their whole lives. The couple’s, Mohammed Shamasne, said he would struggle for the family property. Meanwhile, Arye King, director of the Israel Land Fund, which won a court battle to claim the elderly couples house, says the Palestinian family must obey the court ruling. “I am the owner - it is like being an owner in the middle of Paris or the middle of London - to tell your tenant to go out and he is telling you, ‘no. I don’t want to go out.’ This is what the Shamasnes did. After all they don't want to go out from our apartment, so then we told them we took them to court,” King told RT. The Shamasnes are not the only family on the verge of forceful eviction in East Jerusalem. At least 44 other Arab families face the same threat, according to Free Jerusalem activist Uri Agnon. “The situation now in Sheikh Jarrah is truly awful. The idea that these seven people [in the Shamasne family] may be evicted from their homes any day now is something that troubles each and every person in Jerusalem and not only in it,” Agnon said in an interview to RT. The word is turning a blind eye to the problem as Israel has a powerful lobby abroad, the activist believes.

The Israeli authorities should let the current inhabitants of the disputed house stay and give them all the necessary rights to it, Ben-Yair added. Meanwhile, the fate of the Shamasne family as well as others facing eviction has caused grave concern from the European Union missions in Jerusalem and Ramallah. “The EU calls on the Israeli authorities to reconsider these decisions,” the missions said in a statement on Friday, adding that some 180 households in the area are also facing the threat of eviction. Brussels and the UN have repeatedly condemned Israel's settlement policy, including evictions and demolitions. “The settlement policy is illegal under international law, and its continuation undermines the viability of the two-state solution and the prospect for a lasting peace,” the EU missions stated.

News article:
Israeli occupation forces yesterday demolished three Palestinian homes and facilities funded by the European Union (EU) in the Khashm Al-Darj village located in Hebron's southern city of Yatta. The coordinator at the Palestinian popular committee against the wall and settlements in Yatta, Rateb Al-Jabour, told Quds Press that the houses' demolition, which left three families homeless, was carried out by the occupation bulldozers. Al-Jabour added that Israeli forces have also handed other demolition orders to a number of the city's Palestinian residents under the pretext of "construction without permit", although those buildings were funded by the EU. On his part, the Communication and Information Officer at the European Commission, Shadi Othman, strongly condemned the demolition of the Palestinian structures in Area C, which the EU considers part of a future Palestinian state. Othman said the EU has repeatedly raised the issue of the Israeli offensives on the buildings which it funds. He called on Israel to stop its violations against Palestinians, stressing that the continuous demolition activities are "unacceptable". Read: Israel to demolish 42 Palestinian homes in Hebron The EU official pointed out that in 2016 the occupation forces demolished €500 million worth of EU-funded projects and facilities in Area C. According to the 1995 Oslo II Accord, which was signed between the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and Israel, the West Bank is divided into three areas: Area A which represents 18 per cent of the West Bank and is fully controlled by the Palestinian Authority (PA); Area B, which represents to 21 per cent of the West Bank, is under the PA's civilian control and Israeli security control; Area C, which represents 61 per cent of the West Bank, and lies under the full control of the Israeli government.

News article:
Al-Araqeeb village: Palestinian Bedouins refuse to surrender 116 times Ramzy Baroud Not only has Israel destroyed it numerous times in violation of international law, it expects the Bedouins to cover the cost of the very ruins. Ramzy Baroud Disclaimer: Views expressed by writers in this section are their own and do not necessarily reflect Arab News' point of view On Aug. 1, the Palestinian Bedouin village of Al-Araqeeb was destroyed for the 116th time. As soon as Israeli bulldozers finished their ugly deed and soldiers began evacuating the premises, village residents immediately began rebuilding their homes. Twenty-two families, or about 101 residents, are estimated to live here. By now they are all familiar with the painful routine, considering that the first round of destruction took place in July 2010.It means the village has been destroyed nearly 17 times per year since then. Every single time it was rebuilt, only to be destroyed again. If the repeated destruction of the village is an indication of Israel’s stubborn insistence on uprooting Palestine’s Bedouins, the rebuilding is indicative of the tenacity of the Bedouin community in Palestine. But Al-Araqeeb is only symbolic of that historic fight.It is no exaggeration to state that there is a war waged by Israel against Palestinian Bedouins. The aim is to destroy their culture and force them into townships, similar to those of apartheid South Africa. The geographic space of that war extends from the Negev desert to the South Hebron Hills to Jerusalem.The epicenter of the ongoing fight is Al-Araqeeb. Not only has Israel destroyed it numerous times in violation of international law, it actually delivers a bill to the homeless residents, expecting them to cover the cost of the very ruins wrought by the Israeli state. According to the latest estimates, the families that live in makeshift huts and rely on rudimentary means to survive are expected to pay a bill of 2 million shekels ($600,000).Israel dubs Al-Araqeeb, along with 35 villages in the Negev, as “unrecognized” by the government’s master plan, so they must be erased and their population driven into townships made for the Bedouins. But these villages are older than Israel, and any such master plan could have easily considered this reality. However, what Israel truly labors to achieve is to replace the Bedouins with its own Jewish population, as it has tirelessly done for seven decades.Palestinian Bedouins are known for their tenacity. They fully fathom the history and plight of their ancestors, where generation after generation were ethnically cleansed and exiled to refugee camps outside Palestine, or forcibly removed to other areas. Today’s Bedouin communities refuse to be subjected to that same fate again.The Israeli plan to ethnically cleanse the Bedouins of the Negev is no different from the plan to colonize the West Bank and Judaize the Galilee and Palestinian East Jerusalem. All such efforts culminate in the same routine of removing Arabs and replacing them with Israeli Jews.In 1965, Israel passed the Planning and Building Law, which recognized some Palestinian Arab villages in the Galilee and southern Negev, but excluded others. Nearly 100,000 Bedouins were forcibly removed to “planned townships” to endure economic neglect and poverty. Many refused to be moved, and since then they have fought a protracted war to survive and maintain a semblance of their culture and way of life. Currently, according to the Institute of Palestine Studies (IPS), roughly 130,000 individuals live in the so-called unrecognized villages “under the constant threat of wholesale demolition.” The anomaly is that these Bedouin communities prove the fallacy of the Israeli claim that it was Jewish settlers, not Palestinians, who “made the desert bloom.”A simple look at statistics demolishes that deceptive claim entirely. As of 1935 — 13 years prior to the existence of Israel — Bedouins “cultivated 2,109,234 dunums of land where they grew most of Palestine’s barley and much of the country’s wheat,” said the IPS. Jewish settlers did not arrive in the Negev until 1940, and by 1946 the total Jewish population there did not amount to more than 475.“The amount of land cultivated by the Bedouins in the Negev prior to 1948 came to three times that cultivated by the entire Jewish community in all of Palestine even after sixty years of ‘pioneering’ Zionist settlement,” the IPS concluded. To reverse this indisputable historical reality, Israel has led a campaign to vanquish the Bedouins by severing their relationship to their land. Although this has been done with a great degree of success, the struggle is not yet over. The same struggle is duplicated elsewhere, especially in so-called Area C, encompassing 60 percent of the West Bank. Palestinian Bedouin villages there are also enduring a terrible fight, as many of their villages have been singled out for destruction. Most West Bank Bedouins live in a central area known as the South Hebron Hills. Last month, it was reported that Israel’s Supreme Court is “deciding the fate” of the Bedouin village of Dkeika. Other villages in the area have either been demolished, received demolition orders, or are waiting for their fate to be determined by the court. It is hardly a question of a single village or two. The UN reported that 46 villages in the central West Bank are “at risk of forcible transfer” by the Israeli government.To preclude any legal wrangling, the government has been actively pursuing wholesale, irreversible actions to seal the fate of Bedouins once and for all. In 2013, Israel announced the Prawer Plan, whose goal was the destruction of all unrecognized villages in the Negev. But massive mobilization involving Bedouins and Palestinians throughout the occupied territories defeated the plan, which was officially rescinded in December that same year.However, it is now being revived under the name Prawer II. A draft of the plan, which was leaked to local media, was introduced by Israel’s Agriculture Minister Uri Ariel. It, too, aims to “deny Bedouin citizens land ownership rights and violate their constitutional protections,” reported Patrick Strickland.The war on the Bedouins is part of the larger war on all Palestinians, whether in Israel or under military occupation. While the latter are denied the most basic freedoms, the former are governed by at least 50 discriminatory laws, according to the Haifa-based Adalah Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights. Many of these laws are aimed at depriving Palestinians of the right to own land, or to claim the very land upon which their homes and villages existed for tens and hundreds of years.It should come as no shock, then, to learn that while Palestinian citizens of Israel are estimated at 20 percent of the population, they live on merely 3 percent of the land, and many of them face the constant danger of being evicted and relocated elsewhere.The story of Al-Araqeeb is witness to the never-ending Israeli desire for colonial expansion at the expense of the indigenous population of Palestine, but also of the courage and refusal to give in to fear and despair, as demonstrated by the 22 families of this brave village. In a way, Al-Araqeeb represents the story of all of Palestine and its people.The struggle of Al-Araqeeb should evoke outrage at Israel’s constant violation of human rights, and its refusal to recognize the national aspirations of the Palestinian people. But it should also induce hope that 70 years of colonial expansion cannot defeat or even weaken the will of a village or a nation.• Ramzy Baroud is a journalist, author and editor of Palestine Chronicle.

News article:
JERUSALEM: The Israeli military said it has demolished the West Bank home of a Palestinian man who stabbed three Israelis to death in their home at a nearby Jewish settlement last month. Omar Al-Abed, who is 19 years old, was shot and wounded by an off-duty soldier at the scene of the July 21 attack. He was later arrested. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called him a “beast” who was incited to hate Jews. Wednesday’s actions follow similar destruction of homes of Palestinians who carry out attacks on Israelis. The destructions are meant as a deterrent. Police said they will charge five members of Al-Abed’s family for failing to stop him from carrying out the stabbing. The five were arrested and face prosecution for failing to prevent a crime. Meanwhile, Israel is pressing ahead with construction of an underground barrier along the border with the Gaza Strip in an ambitious project meant to halt the threat of attack tunnels built by the Hamas militant group. Cranes and work crews are digging holes and installing sensors and other equipment for a structure that is to stretch along the entire 60-km border when it is complete. Gadi Yarkoni, head of a local council, said the project is a key reason the area has enjoyed a surge in growth and attracted young families since a devastating war with Hamas three years ago. In the 2014 war, Hamas militants made their way several times into Israel through a tunnel network, terrifying locals. Yarkoni said “building the barrier is the right thing to do.” In a separate development, the daughter of the American ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, has immigrated to Israel and taken Israeli citizenship. The 24-year-old Talia Friedman arrived at Ben Gurion Airport on Tuesday on a charter flight carrying over 200 new immigrants from North America and was greeted by her father. Friedman, President Donald Trump’s former bankruptcy attorney, was appointed ambassador earlier this year. His appointment was opposed by Democrats and some Jewish groups because of donations to Israeli settlements, opposition to Palestinian statehood and vocal support for hard-line Israeli government positions. Friedman told Israeli media that he was proud of his daughter. He said that “she loves Israel, we all love Israel. Our whole family loves Israel.” Friedman is a member of Trump’s team spearheading efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.

News article:
Tel Aviv’s forces have flattened a house near the city of Ramallah in the West Bank, which belonged to a Palestinian youth accused by the regime of being behind a deadly stabbing attack against Israeli settlers. The demolition took place in the West Bank village of Kobar on Wednesday, according to the Israeli military. Residents said Israeli military vehicles and bulldozers entered the area north of Ramallah at around 3:00 a.m. (0000 GMT) and surrounded the house, one floor of which was still under construction. Tel Aviv claims that 19-year-old Omar al-Abed, who used to live there, had fatally stabbed three settlers in the nearby settlement of Neve Tsuf on July 21. Abed has, since then, been placed under arrest. His family members were also detained for what Israeli officials call their failure to prevent the alleged attack. Later in July, the Israeli military raided and closed off the village.

Israel took the move after a deadly shootout outside the compound on July 14, heightening the fear among Palestinians that Tel Aviv is seeking to manipulate the premises’ status quo. More than a dozen Palestinians have been killed in the ensuing tensions.

In a raid Thursday morning on the Ramallah-area village of Deir Abu Mashaal in the central occupied West Bank, Israeli forces blew up the home of slain Palestinian Adel Hassan Ahmad Ankoush, who was killed by Israeli forces in June along with two other Palestinians after the three carried out a deadly shooting and stabbing attack in occupied East Jerusalem that left an Israeli border police officer dead. Israeli forces raided Ankoush’s family home and set up explosives around the house, as other forces surrounded Deir Abu Mashaal and deployed across all entrances to the village, while drones hovered overhead. According to locals, a fire erupted after the army set off the explosives, after which time Palestinian Civil Defense firefighters arrived on the scene to put out the fire.

News article:
After demolishing a Palestinian village in the Negev, an Israeli court has ordered residents of Al-Araqeeb village to pay the government for the cost of bulldozing their homes. Six residents of the village which is "unrecognized" by the Israeli state in southern Israel have been asked to pay a total of $541,000 for the cumulative cost of destroying their homes 116 times since 2010. The Palestinian village is one of many that were established in the Negev following the expulsion of Palestinians from their homes in 1948. In the aftermath of the expulsion of 750,000 Palestinians, over 600 villages were razed to the ground by Zionist militias. Al-Araqeeb is just one of 35 other Bedouin Palestinian villages which the Israeli state refuses to recognise and offer any government assistance. According to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), more than half of the approximately 160,000 Bedouins in the Negev reside in "unrecognized villages". Read more: Thousands of Israeli-Arabs demonstrate against demolition of homes in Israel Despite the fact that these villages are as old as Israel itself and the way of life of the Bedouins stretches much further back, the villages are under constant threat. Not only are the residents denied basic rights but hundreds of thousands have the constant threat of demolition hanging over their heads. Having had their homes demolished 116 times, six of the 34 residents who decided to see out the legal proceedings through to the end are now being forced to pay over half a million dollars. Israeli courts have demanded compensation not only for the demolition of the homes but also for the cost of the state lawyers. It's not yet clear what the penalty will be for the Bedouins if they fail to pay the damages demanded by the state, as is most likely the case. Representatives of the residents condemning the court's decision as a double punishment are considering an appeal. "In my opinion, the state demolished the village in violation of the law, and went one step further to demand compensation for an act that wasn't legal in the first place", said attorney Khaled Sawalhi, the legal representative. Human rights groups have also criticised the move on a number grounds. Haya Noah, director of the Negev Coexistence Forum for Civil Equality, was quoted by Haaretz as being astonished by the court's decision. Pointing to the fact that demolitions are carried out by units having an annual state budget; he added "there's no real reason to claim payment". Noah also said: "Instead of pushing the residents to the wall, the state must provide shelter for the villagers and stop the campaign of demolitions and harassment."

News article:
Israel's demolition of Palestinian homes is now almost a daily occurrence. The reasons vary but the phenomenon is ultimately a form of collective punishment; the humiliation of the occupied by the occupier and a means to achieve "demographic control" of occupied Palestinian territory. The Zionist state publicises the demolition of homes of the families of Palestinians who are alleged to have attacked Israelis, whether civilians or occupying forces; Israel claims that this is a deterrent to others who might be contemplating such attacks. Demolition can happen immediately after an attack or some days later; families await their fate not knowing when the roof over their heads will be destroyed by an Israeli bulldozer. The most recent of these demolitions was of the family home of Omar Abdel Gelil Al-Abed from the village of Kobar near Ramallah. Abed is accused of killing three Israeli settlers on 21 July in the nearby illegal settlement of Halamish in the West Bank. As with other demolitions, this was carried out under heavy protection from the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) accompanied by clashes with local residents. Israel demolishes home of Palestinian resistance fighter Israel may also "seal" the home of an assailant rather than demolish it, as was the case with Hassan Ankosh, one of three young Palestinians who carried out an attack at Damascus Gate in occupied Jerusalem. The homes of the other two assailants were demolished. The decisions were approved by Israel's High Court. However, Israel has never demolished the homes of Jewish Israelis who have attacked Palestinian civilians. On the same day that Israeli forces delivered demolition orders to the families of four Palestinian assailants, the Supreme Court decided not to demolish the homes of three Israelis convicted of brutally killing 16-year-old Muhammed Abu Khdair in 2014. Jewish terrorist Yosef Haim Ben-David and two minors were convicted of kidnapping and burning the Palestinian teenager to death in 2014. The Israeli court rejected the Abu Khdair family's petition to demolish the homes of the terrorists; retired Israeli judge Elyakim Rubinstein ruled that too much time had passed between the "abominable act of murder" and the submission of the petition. The judge's ruling was telling. He emphasised that "Regulation 119" in Israeli law permitted the demolition of homes of anyone suspected of "terror activity" and of their "accomplices and supporters," whether they are Jewish Israelis or Palestinians. "We can understand how the victim's family feels… we are dealing with a deterrent and not a punitive measure. It should be remembered that the perpetrators were given lengthy prison sentences," added Judge Neal Hendel, reiterating the Israeli government's contentious claims that such punitive demolitions deter "terrorists" from carrying out attacks. More recently, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan argued for the demolition of the homes of the Israeli Arab citizens from Umm Al-Fahm whose attack at the entrance to Al-Aqsa mosque triggered the closure of the holy site and subsequent standoff between Palestinians and security forces. There is, of course, no evidence that demolishing the family homes of Palestinians deters others, otherwise the attacks would by now — after thousands of demolitions — have surely stopped altogether. In fact the demolition of Ghassan Abu Jamal's home in 2015 was followed by an attack by his cousin Alaa a week later. "Alaa knew what the consequences of an operation were for the family," commented Muawiyah Abu Jamal, "but when he was humiliated in front of his three sons, it obviously hurt his sense of pride." Palestinians see these demolitions as a form of collective punishment against the families of assailants who had nothing to do either with planning or carrying out such attacks. Israel demands compensation from residents after demolishing their homes Some Palestinian homes are demolished due to a "planning policy" which in practice is the mechanism for controlling the demography through Israeli policies designed to ensure a Jewish majority from the River Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea and in specific areas such as the prized city of Jerusalem. The discriminatory policy of denying planning permits for Palestinians to build on their own land or to extend existing homes to accommodate natural growth is well documented. This denial is particularly significant in Jerusalem, where Israel regularly approves plans for illegal settlements in occupied East Jerusalem, but denies permits to Palestinians a stone's throw away for home extensions of just a few square metres. Israel has often argued that building within existing illegal settlements is necessary for the same "natural growth" argument which it refuses to accept from Palestinians. The Jerusalem neighbourhood of Issawiya has been awaiting approval for an infrastructure plan for over 15 years but it seems that it must wait a lot longer. In the meantime, some of its residents have built on their privately-owned land but have either had their homes demolished or, in a further humiliating act, have had to demolish their own homes to avoid extortionate fines by the Municipality if it carried out the demolition. This was the case of Firas Saleh, who was forced to demolish his own home, in front of his children, or pay $80,000 for the privilege of the Israeli authorities demolishing it. The children had helped to build it and were devastated. Khaled Mahmoud had his 4 bedroom apartments demolished, making 40 people homeless. He had been trying to secure a building permit since 2002 without success. Both families undertook to rebuild their homes. Another Palestinian neighbourhood under constant threat of house demolition or eviction is Silwan on the edge of the Old City of Jerusalem. The most recent victims were the Abu Sneineh family whose home was demolished in early August but was partially rebuilt by the family and neighbours, only to see the new structure demolished by the Israelis as well. Men, women & children helped Abu Sneinah Family in rebuilding their house, that was demolished by #IOF in Silwan town. #Palestine#Jerusalem pic.twitter.com/aSllXPow4Y — Palestine Social (@PalestineSocial) August 18, 2017 Others who are targeted regularly by Israel for home demolitions are the Bedouin Palestinians on both sides of the Green (1949 Armistice) Line. The "unrecognised" villages of Al-Araqib and Umm Alhiran have been targeted for demolition of all structures, with the former being demolished and rebuilt at least 114 times since 2010. Israel wants to move the Bedouins to American-style reservations and build Jew-only settlements on the site of Umm Alhiran. The residents of Khan Al-Ahmar in the West Bank have also lived under the threat of eviction and demolition of their village. In the past three weeks, Israel has targeted Palestinian schools in Jabal Al-Baba and Jubbet Al-Dhib, and confiscated the only source of power for a school in Abu Nuwar by removing its solar panels. In the case of Jubbet Al-Dhib, its pupils started the new school year with lessons in tents. Palestinians hold Friday prayers at Jerusalem home under threat from settlers With no evidence that demolishing homes of Palestinian attackers really deters others, and knowing that house demolitions can only increase the hatred of Israel amongst Palestinians, it appears that this policy has failed spectacularly in what it sets out to do. Israel often accuses the Palestinian Authority of incitement and blames it for attacks against Israelis. However, it is to the Israeli occupation and its carefully developed oppressive policies that we should look for incitement. Would you think kindly of an occupier who has just taken the roof from over your head for any reason whatsoever, let alone political reasons? Israel's demolition policy is, in the end, a spectacular own goal. The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.

Bulldozers operated by Israeli occupation forces have razed swathes of Palestinian land, including farms planted with well-established olive trees, around the city of Salfit in the occupied West Bank, Quds Press reported on Sunday. According to researcher Khalid Maali, the land belonged to the Islamic Awqaf (religious endowment) authorities. The expert in settlement issues explained that the Israeli bulldozers targeted land in the area known locally as Khellat Al-Jamei. Part of this area has already been developed by Israeli settlers to build a factory in the Ariel Industrial Zone, part of the illegal Ariel settlement bloc. Israel claims that this area is state land. Maali said that the Palestinian Ministry of Awqaf had tried several times to restore it, but the Israelis rejected the requests and cracked down on activities on the ground. He pointed out that the Palestinian residents of are being targeted directly by the Israeli occupation forces and settlers, noting that they do not have enough official and popular support to be able to defend their land. Read: Israel cuts water supply to Salfit Salfit is important for Israel's illegal Jewish settlers, Maali pointed. The area contains more than 25 illegal settlement blocs which the occupation authorities are planning to expand. Maali concluded by noting that the Israeli judicial system provides a legal fig leaf for the settlers' activities in the Salfit area, which is one of the most damaged of Palestinian cities.

News article:
Occupied Jerusalem: Israeli police on Tuesday evicted a Palestinian family from the East Jerusalem home in which they lived for over half a century. Plans for the eviction had been criticised by the European Union, United Nations and various Western governments, though not the United States. Municipality officials backed by security guards enforced a court order Tuesday to remove the six-member Shamasneh family from a home claimed by heirs of a Jewish family forced to abandon it in 1948 when it came under Jordanian control. Fahamiya Shamasneh, 75, told AFP police arrived unannounced before dawn and forced her out of the house along with her husband Ayoub, 84, their son and his family. The couple had lived in the house in the Shaikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem near the historic Old City for 53 years. An AFP journalist saw young Jewish men moving into the building after the family were escorted out. “It is the hardest day,” Fahamiya Shamasneh said tearfully on the street after being evicted. She said she was heating milk for her grandchildren when “they knocked on the door and said ‘open it’s the police’. “They took us out and threw us outside." “What greater injustice is there than this? Maybe we will sleep in the street.” The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said it would seek to support the family financially to find another home. Israel took control of the area after the 1967 war and continued existing renting arrangements with Arab tenants. But a law allowing Jews to reclaim former homes or repurchase them have set up such conflicts. Ayoub Shamasneh, 79, said his case was still pending. “How can they do this to us?” he said. Palestinians claim the evictions aim to alter East Jerusalem’s demography. Israel says it is merely enforcing the law.

News article:
Israeli police on Tuesday evicted a Palestinian family from the east Jerusalem home in which they lived for over half a century, making way for Israelis deemed the legal occupants. The Shamasneh family has for years been fighting a court battle against Jewish claimants who said that the building was their family property, which they fled when east Jerusalem was occupied by Jordanian troops in the 1948 war that led to the creation of the Jewish state Under Israeli law, if Jews can prove their families lived in east Jerusalem homes before the 1948 war they can demand that Israel's general custodian office release the property and return their "ownership rights". During the war, thousands of Jews fled Jerusalem as Jordanian-led Arab forces seized the city, while hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled from land that was later to become Israel. No such law exists for Palestinians who lost their land. In 2013 the Israeli Supreme Court ruled in favour of the Jewish claimants, who subsequently sold the property on. An AFP journalist on Tuesday saw young Jewish men moving into the building after the Shamasnehs were escorted out by police. Fahamiya Shamasneh, 75, told AFP that police arrived before dawn ordering her, her sick husband Ayoub, 84, their son and his family out of the house in the upscale Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood where the couple lived for 53 years. "What greater injustice is there than this?" she said. "Maybe we will sleep in the street." It was the first eviction in the neighbourhood since 2009, according to Israeli anti-occupation group Peace Now, part of a fight over the disputed status of Jerusalem. Israel sees the city as its undivided capital, while the Palestinians want the eastern sector as their future capital. Israel occupied east Jerusalem in the Six-Day War of 1967 and later annexed it in a move never recognised by the international community. Around 200,000 Israeli Jews now live in east Jerusalem in settlement homes considered illegal under international law. Peace Now says the house is part of a larger process of establishing settlements in Sheikh Jarrah. "Settlers are already inside the Shamasneh family's home," it said in a statement Tuesday morning. "The eviction of the Shamasneh family, who resided in the house since 1964, is not only brutal but it is also indicating a dangerous trend that could threaten a future compromise in Jerusalem," it said.

News article:
The number of demolitions of Palestinian homes and other structures by Israeli authorities in occupied East Jerusalem is almost as high as 2016, which saw the highest number of demolitions since 2000, according to a new UN report. "Recent developments in East Jerusalem highlight the coercive environment affecting many Palestinian residents of the city," the UN OCHA monthly bulletin states, citing evictions and planned evictions in neighbourhoods like Sheikh Jarrah. At least 260 Palestinians living in 24 residential buildings in the area are under threat of eviction in cases "brought against them by Israeli settler organisations, the General Custodian and/or Israeli individuals". UN OCHA notes that, whether by demolition or eviction, displacement generates substantial humanitarian needs, "it deprives people of their homes, disrupts their livelihoods and access to services, and often has a devastating psychosocial impact, particularly among children". Israeli settlers are "targeting densely populated Palestinian residential areas of East Jerusalem," reports the UN agency, "in particular the Muslim and Christian quarters of the Old City, Silwan, Sheikh Jarrah, At-Tur (Mount of Olives), Wadi Joz, Ras Al-Amud and Jabal Al-Mukaber." Read: Israel issues more house demolition notices to Palestinians More than 3,000 Israeli settlers now live in these areas, "either in houses expropriated using the Absentee Property Law on the basis of alleged prior Jewish ownership, in buildings purchased from Palestinian owners, or in residences custom built and financed by settler organisations". Expanding on the use of the courts by settlers to pursue the eviction of Palestinian families, UN OCHA notes how such methods are "based on claims the properties had been owned by Jewish individuals or associations prior to 1948". A 1970 Israeli law acknowledges such claims "despite the fact that Jews who lost their properties during 1948 received compensation and alternative housing, primarily in neighbourhoods previously inhabited by Palestinians," UN OCHA states. The law "does not permit Palestinians who owned land or property in areas before 1948 that are now part of the State of Israel and were declared 'absentees' to regain their former possessions." For Palestinians, the impact of intense settler activity includes "restrictions on public space, residential growth and freedom of movement, along with increased friction and violence", as well as, "in the most severe cases", "loss of property and the eviction of long-term Palestinian residents". In 2017 to date, up to and including August, Israeli authorities have demolished 107 structures in occupied East Jerusalem due to the lack of ("nearly impossible to obtain") building permits. The demolitions have resulted in the displacement of 179 people, including 107 children. Four neighbourhoods, in particular, were "most heavily affected" – Jabal Al-Mukaber, Beit Hanina, Issawiya and Silwan – and, combined, accounted for 75 per cent of "demolition incidents documented this year and 70 per cent of all structures demolished" in 2017 to date. The average number of people displaced in 2017 as a result of demolitions in East Jerusalem has slightly increased compared with the monthly average in 2016 (22.3 vs 21.2).

Israeli bulldozers demolished a Palestinian home in Umm Qabu village in the Negev of southern Israel for the eighth time on Thursday. According to witnesses, Israeli bulldozers raided the village on Thursday morning and demolished a house belonging to Salman Abu Sabileh, whose home was demolished seven times before by Israeli authorities for allegedly lacking difficult-to-obtain building permits. Israeli forces had also raided other villages in the Negev at the time, according to locals, including Umm Batin and Abu Kaff village.

Unable to obtain permits, many residents in the villages have no other option but to build without a permit. Groups have also noted that Israel’s demolition campaigns in the Negev coincide with Israeli plans of transferring the Bedouin population to alternate sites to make room for Jewish communities.

News article:
The Israeli forces have demolished a Palestinian residential building in a West Bank village located to the southeast of occupied East Jerusalem al-Quds. The Palestinian Wafa news agency reported on Monday that Israeli bulldozers demolished the residential building in the village of al-Zayyem under the pretext that it had been built without a permit. The agency noted that Israeli forces cordoned off the area where the building was located before bulldozers proceeded to demolish it. This is while the village, categorized as Area B, is under Palestinian Civil Administration and that building permits in Area B are usually issued by local municipal councils and not by the Israeli regime, according to Wafa. The demolition of Palestinian homes and structures most commonly takes place in Area C, where nearly all Palestinian applications for building permits are denied by the Israeli authorities. A recent report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) showed that Israeli authorities have demolished or seized 1,089 Palestinian-owned structures since the start of the last year up until December 28. The demolitions have left some 1,593 Palestinians homeless and affected the lives of another 7,101, according to the report released on December 29, 2016. The UN also notes that the “vast majority” of the Palestinian structures are destroyed or seized because the Israeli policies made it virtually impossible for Palestinians to obtain building permits. Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes and structures have raised alarm among diplomats and human rights groups over what they regard as the Tel Aviv regime’s continued violation of international law.

The Palestinian Wafa news agency reported on Monday that Israeli bulldozers demolished the residential building in the village of al-Zayyem under the pretext that it had been built without a permit. The agency noted that Israeli forces cordoned off the area where the building was located before bulldozers proceeded to demolish it. This is while the village, categorized as Area B, is under Palestinian Civil Administration and that building permits in Area B are usually issued by local municipal councils and not by the Israeli regime, according to Wafa. The demolition of Palestinian homes and structures most commonly takes place in Area C, where nearly all Palestinian applications for building permits are denied by the Israeli authorities. A recent report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) showed that Israeli authorities have demolished or seized 1,089 Palestinian-owned structures since the start of the last year up until December 28. The demolitions have left some 1,593 Palestinians homeless and affected the lives of another 7,101, according to the report released on December 29, 2016. The UN also notes that the “vast majority” of the Palestinian structures are destroyed or seized because the Israeli policies made it virtually impossible for Palestinians to obtain building permits. Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes and structures have raised alarm among diplomats and human rights groups over what they regard as the Tel Aviv regime’s continued violation of international law.

News article:
By embedding itself throughout Afghanistan’s government and cultivating networks of assassins and spies, Iran is “working quietly and relentlessly to spread its influence … following the withdrawal of the United States,” The New York Times reported Saturday. While Iran was once at odds with the Sunni terrorist group, it now sees the Taliban as a “loyal proxy” that can be exploited to “keep the country destabilized, without tipping it over.” Iran’s growing ties with the Taliban emerged after a United States airstrike in Pakistan last year, which killed Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour. Mansour died shortly after returning from a trip to Iran, where he met with top Iranian and Russian officials. While Iran had originally fought the Taliban, it later supported it in order to raise the cost of American intervention in Afghanistan, with an eye towards getting the United States to retreat. Iran has increasingly come to view the Taliban as a “useful proxy force,” the Times reported. While these ties were denied by Mohammad Reza Bahrami, Iran’s ambassador to Afghanistan, the Times described Iran’s diplomatic priorities as complementing those of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps—“the first openly sowing economic and cultural influence, and the second aggressively exerting subversive force behind the scenes.” “Iran has sent squads of assassins, secretly nurtured spies and infiltrated police ranks and government departments, especially in western provinces,” the Times reported, citing Afghan officials. Afghan police say that they have arrested 2,000 people over the past three years in counterterrorism operations in the western Herat province, which borders Iran. Many of the suspects are either criminals or rebels who live in Iran and cross the border to attack security or government facilities. A former mayor of Herat, the capital city of the province, told the Times that the local Iranian consulate disseminates propaganda and is also “devising terrorist activities.” In the past year, Iran-backed Taliban forces have twice attacked Farah, the capital of another western province. Mohammad Asif Rahimi, the governor of Herat, said that had the Taliban been successful in capturing the city, all of western Afghanistan would have come under the sway of the Taliban. Timor Sharan, an Afghan government official, attributed the Taliban’s boldness to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. “The fact is that America created this void,” Sharan told the Times. “This vacuum encouraged countries to get involved. The Syria issue gave confidence to Iran and Russia, and now that confidence is playing out in Afghanistan.” While it may seem counter-intuitive for Shiite Iran to support a Sunni group, Iran’s record has shown that it prioritizes its imperial ambitions over sectarian differences. Iran has backed al-Qaeda and still harbors senior members of the terrorist group, and the backing it gave al-Qaeda Iraq (AQI) was crucial in the formation of ISIS, which evolved from AQI. Senior officials of the Sunni terrorist group Hamas were also received by top Iranian authorities over the weekend in Tehran, where they attended the inauguration of President Hassan Rouhani.

News article:
WASHINGTON ― To the wall that Mexico is not going to pay for and the Iran nuclear deal that hasn’t been torn up, to China still not being labeled a currency manipulator and an embassy in Israel still not being moved to Jerusalem, President Donald Trump can now add the Afghanistan war still not ending. Seven months into his presidency, not only is he not withdrawing from what he had called a “terrible mistake” during his campaign, he is reportedly approving thousands of more troops, along with an open-ended commitment to remain. Advertisement “The consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable,” Trump said in a prime-time speech Monday night from an Army post adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery. The decision, which Trump’s military advisers had pushed for, worried his supporters who fear that the firing of top aide Steve Bannon will allow the “establishment” and moderates to assert themselves in the White House. “Now it’s the generals’ turn,” said a prominent Republican National Committee member and Bannon-backer who spoke on condition of anonymity. Bannon had opposed a troop increase and instead had favored outsourcing the war to contractors. “I see an emerging [Arnold] Schwarzenegger metamorphosis,” the RNC member added, referring to the actor-turned-governor in California who ran as a Republican but then pushed a number of moderate, even liberal policies in office. Advertisement Another top RNC member, also speaking on condition of anonymity, had a simple explanation for Trump’s many reversals since taking office: “Overtaken by reality.” Trump himself said Monday night that “my original instinct was to pull out, and historically I like following my instincts. But all my life, I have heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office. In other words, when you are president of the United States.” His decision to escalate rather than abandon what is now the nation’s longest-running war mirrors the actions of his predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama. Obama campaigned in 2008 on ending the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which began in 2001 and 2003, respectively. But in his first term, Obama approved a massive “surge” in Afghanistan to roll back Taliban gains and strengthen the U.S.-backed government before rapidly withdrawing almost all U.S. forces during his second term. Trump in those years supported Obama’s decision: “I agree with Pres. Obama on Afghanistan. We should have a speedy withdrawal. Why should we keep wasting our money ― rebuild the U.S.!” he wrote in early 2013. Advertisement I agree with Pres. Obama on Afghanistan. We should have a speedy withdrawal. Why should we keep wasting our money -- rebuild the U.S.! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2013 During his presidential campaign, Trump argued that U.S. involvement in wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan were “stupid.” “We made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place, we had real brilliant thinkers that didn’t know what the hell they were doing, and it’s a mess,” he told CNN in October 2015. The next spring, he said he favored withdrawing from the Middle East entirely. “When it’s not ISIS, it will be somebody else. We have been over there for so many years. We have spent up to $5 trillion,” he told Fox News in May 2016. “At some point we have to get the hell out. You know with ISIS, you knock them out, there will be someone else. It will continue to form. It’s a mess.” Trump’s decision to increase the military presence in Afghanistan adds to the already long list of campaign promises he made that he has either been unable to keep or on which he has changed his position. Advertisement From the earliest days of his campaign, Trump not only promised a massive wall on the southern border but that Mexico would pay for it. In a phone call a week into his tenure, however, Trump conceded to Mexico President Enrique Peña Nieto that that would not actually happen. But he asked Pena Nieto not say so publicly. Trump promised to label China a currency manipulator. He did not. Trump promised to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He has not done that, either. Nor has he pulled out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, voided the deal lifting sanctions on Iran in return for an end to its nuclear program or replaced the Affordable Care Act. “And no infrastructure deal,” said John Weaver, a top aide to Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s Republican presidential bid last year, about Trump’s promise to spend $1 trillion to rebuild the nation’s highways, railroads and airports. Weaver said Trump now has the challenge of presenting a plan supported by his military commanders after having squandered his credibility with falsehoods about everything from the size of his inaugural crowds to a made-up phone call from the leader of the Boy Scouts of America. “How is he going to sell this to the country?” Weaver said. “Here he is with disapproval ratings that are tremendous and nobody believes him.” Advertisement Trump’s defenders conceded that he has not delivered on his campaign promises but argued that he is still only in his first year.

News article:
© Brian Harris / Global Look Press © Lance Cpl. Ismael E. Ortega The president told McMaster "to go back to the drawing board," the official said. "But he just kept coming back with the same thing." The Defense Secretary [Mattis] has been using this line in meetings: "Mr. President, we haven't fought a 16-year war so much as we have fought a one-year war, 16 times." In Nangarhar, over a year ago, the vanguard of the movement was a group of Pakistani militants who had lived there for years as 'guests' of the Afghan government and local people. While initially avoiding attacks on Afghan forces, they made their new allegiances known by attacking the Taleban and taking their territory. This evening Trump will announce a new " path forward " in the occupation of Afghanistan. According to the usual leaks it will be very same path the U.S. has takenSeveral thousands soldiers from the U.S. and various NATO countries will (in vain) train the Afghan army. Special Forces and CIA goons will raid this or that family compound on someone's say-so. Bombs will be dropped on whatever is considered a target.Trump will announce that 1,000 or so troops will be added to the current contingent. About 15,000 foreign troops will be in Afghanistan. About three contractors per each soldier will be additionally deployed.Trump knows that this "path forward" is nonsense that leads nowhere, that the best option for all foreign troops in Afghanistan is to simply leave:Fear mongering is abound: "What happens if Afghanistan becomes a hotbed for international terrorists?" But few if any international terrorist incident in the "west" were ever organized in Afghanistan. In all recent incidents the culprits were locals.The generals do not want to concede that they lost another war. The CIA wants to keep is militarized forces and drones which it justifies through its engagement in Afghanistan. The drug production in Afghanistan, which the U.S. never really tried to suppress, is rumored to finance "black" CIA operations just like it did during the Vietnam war and throughout various South American conflicts. The members of the Afghan government all live off U.S. largess. The war in Afghanistan is a racket paid for with the lives of countless Afghans and U.S. taxpayer money.Now tightly under control of neo-conservative leaning generals Trump had little chance to make a different decision. He had asked his team for alternatives but none were given to him:Trump's former strategic advisor Steve Bannon promoted an idea of Eric Prince, a shady provider of international mercenaries. Afghanistan would be given to a private for-profit entity comparable to the Brutish East-India Company. That company, with its own large army, robbed India of all possible valuables and nearly became a state of its own. But Prince and Bannon forgot to tell the end of that company's story. It came down after a large mutiny in India defeated its armed forces and had to be bailed out by the government. The end state of an East India Company like entity in Afghanistan would the same as it is now.Then there is the fairy tale of the mineral rich Afghanistan. $1 trillion of iron, copper, rare-metals and other nice stuff could be picked out of the ground. But in reality the costs of picking minerals in Afghanistan is, for various reasons, prohibitive.The Bannon/Prince plan was lunatic but it was at least somewhat different than the never changing ideas of the military:That line has already been used five years ago to describe the war on Afghanistan. (It originally describes the 10 year war in Vietnam.) Mattis did not explain why or how that repetitive one year rhythm would now change.The Trump administration wants to hold back the yearly cash payment to the Pakistani military. This has been tried before and the Pakistani response was to close down the U.S. supply route to Afghanistan. An alternative supply route through Russia had been developed but has now been shut down over U.S. hostilities towards that country. The U.S. can not sustain a deployment in Afghanistan without a sea-land route into the country.The Afghan army is, like the government, utterly corrupt and filled with people who do not want to engage in fighting. More "training" will not change that. The U.S. proxy government is limited to a few larger cities. It claims to control many districts but its forces are often constricted to central compounds while the Taliban rule the countryside. In total the Taliban and associated local war lords hold more than half of the country and continue to gain support. The alleged ISIS derivative in Afghanistan was originally formed out of Pakistani Taliban by the Afghan National Directorate of Security which is under the control of the CIA:ISIS in Afghanistan, founded as an anti-Taliban force, is just another form of the usual Afghan warlordism.Without political aim the military is deployed in tactical engagements that make no long lasting differences. Any attempts to negotiate some peace in Afghanistan requires extensive engagement with the Taliban, Pakistan, China, Russia and Iran. No one in Washington is willing to commit to that.Trump's likely decision means that the story of the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan will continue throughout the next years exactly as it happened during the last 16 years. The decision, once made, is unlikely to change until the next presidential election. The 16 one-year-wars in Afghanistan will become 20 one-year-wars for no perceivable gain.The only conceivable event that could change the situation is an incident with a large number of U.S. military casualties. That could lead to a groundswell of anti-war sentiment which could press Congress into legislating an end of the war. But are the Taliban interested in achieving that?

News article:
The U.S. and its NATO allies launched their invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 in a mission to oust the ruling Taliban and deny the militants who planned the 9/11 attacks a safe haven while establishing a democratic state. Sixteen years later and the U.S. involvement in the central Asian country shows no signs of coming to an end. President Donald Trump bowed to pressure from military officials and announced a 4,000-troop surge Monday. Below, Newsweek reviews some of the blunders the U.S. has made over the decade and a half of its involvement. 1. Going it alone against the Taliban The U.S. made a key mistake early, in refusing help from NATO allies to defeat the Taliban after the invasion, according to experts. Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld reportedly believed that defeating the Islamist militia was a task best accomplished by the U.S. alone, without other militaries getting in the way, and he appeared vindicated when the Taliban rapidly crumpled. However, when U.S. forces were pulled out to take part in the 2004 invasion of Iraq, NATO forces were insufficient to prevent Taliban forces from re-establishing a foothold. “By the time NATO got involved big time, a new civil war was underway and the best opportunity to build a stable Afghanistan had been squandered,” wrote Stephen Walt, the Robert and Renée Belfer professor of international relations at Harvard, in Foreign Policy magazine in 2014. 2. Planning based on wishful thinking In a 2010 report, Pentagon chiefs detailed significant failings in the past decade’s U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan and Iraq. The report reserved its toughest criticism for how the U.S. handled key transition moments, such as NATO's 2006 takeover of military operations in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, “the planning assumed that the chief duty” of international troops after 2006 would be reconstruction and humanitarian aid—an assumption that turned out to be widely off the mark as the Taliban launched an insurgency. Story continues Taliban Stringer/Reuters The reason, the report says, was that military planning was based on “U.S. expectations instead of those consistent with the host nation and mission”—in other words, wishful thinking. “For example,” the report notes, “the planned end-state for Afghanistan was envisioned to be a strong central government despite no record of such a government in its history and lack of broad popular support for that system of governance.” 3. Corrupt governance The 2004 constitution for the post-Taliban Afghanistan established a republican state, in which the government in Kabul and President Hamid Karzai wielded enormous authority, bypassing local traditions of regional autonomy. The system was ripe for exploitation by corrupt officials, who established extensive patronage networks. It also lacked the resources and staff to function efficiently, rendering the country dependent on foreign assistance. Hamid Karzai Omar Sobhani/Reuters “Most Afghans care little for Kabul, however, and even less so for the men Kabul sends to lead their local governance. They want local officials who look like them, speak like them, and whom they know. The lack of coordination between top down government and bottom up democracy only adds to dysfunction,” wrote Michael Rubin, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a senior lecturer at the Naval Postgraduate School in 2012. 4. Spiraling drug trade In the wake of the 2001 invasion, the U.S. pledged to wipe out Afghanistan’s opiate trade, which is the source of much of the world’s heroin. The U.S. government has spent $12 billion on eradication efforts, yet Afghanistan now supplies around 90 percent of the world’s opium. GettyImages-1540301 Getty Some critics argue that the higher prices commanded by opium as a result of eradication efforts has incentivized impoverished farmers to crow poppies, boosting opium production. Others point to local corruption and flat-rate taxes imposed in Taliban-controlled areas as factors, with poppies cheaper to harvest and more lucrative than legal crops. The Taliban has profited from the botched eradication efforts, forming cartels to control production and distribution, and taking an estimated $200 million to $400 million a year from the illicit opium economy. 5. Millions spent on Italian goats The U.S. has spent hundreds of millions attempting to boost the legitimate Afghan economy, with the Task Force for Business Stability Operations (TFBSO), a U.S. Department of Defense agency, spending $800 million on various projects and initiatives from 2009 to 2015. Among those detailed in a 2015 Senate hearing was a bid to boost the cashmere industry by importing nine rare Italian goats. The goats went missing, presumably eaten, and the $6 million project was never completed. John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, testified at the hearing that many TFBSO projects had been managed poorly or not at all and that they suffered from “waste, fraud and abuse.” 6. Obama surge Soon after taking office, President Barack Obama ordered a troop surge in Afghanistan to combat a resurgent Taliban, with the president initially committing 17,000 extra troops to the country and then a further 30,000 in 2009. Barack Obama in Afghanistan Jonathan Ernst/Reuters The president’s decision to set a timeline for U.S. involvement in Afghanistan undermined the mission, critics say. The timeline notified the Taliban how long they would have to hang on until the U.S. presence dwindled and they could gear up their attacks, and it eroded the chances the militants would surrender, critics charge. The U.S. began the drawdown of its military forces from Afghanistan in 2014. “Immediately, our NATO partners started charting their own departure, not necessarily on a coherent coalition timeline. Any Afghan official who cared about his own survival took the hint that they should begin to make their accommodation to Pakistan, Iran, or the Taliban,” wrote Rubin. Then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates had warned ahead of the Obama’s announcement that a timeline could strengthen extremist groups. “Taliban and Al-Qaeda, as far as they’re concerned, defeated one superpower. For them to be seen to defeat a second, I think, would have catastrophic consequences in terms of energizing the extremist movement, Al-Qaeda recruitment, operations, fundraising and so on. I think it would be a huge setback for the United States,” said Gates in 2009 in a CNN interview. Related Articles

News article:
New US policy on Pakistan is old, and has just one wild card: Trump himself The US has consistently hid behind the idea that Pakistan is the biggest obstacle to peace in Afghanistan. This notion is narrow, deeply flawed, and creates internal contradictionsand failuresin US policy in the region. Speaking at Fort Myer on Monday about his Afghanistan policy, US President Donald Trump has put Pakistan on notice. While acknowledging that Pakistan has been a valued partner in the past, he has, like his predecessor, Barack Obama, accused Pakistan of harbouring ‘criminals and terrorists’ and said “our new strategy [will] change the approach and how to deal with Pakistan.” In 2009, President Barack Obama said much the same. So, what’s new? Trump. Trump is the new feature in this policy, not because he has found an Open Sesame to the problem of Afghanistan and, by extension, the region, but because he will make a wicked problem wickeder through an internally incoherent policy. Consider. For a long time the thinking in some circles in Washington has been to accuse Pakistan for US failures in Afghanistan. This line of argument is also trotted out by Indian and Afghan analysts. If Pakistan reins in the Taliban and the Haqqanis, Afghanistan’s political and security landscape will become salubrious for the kind of peace and prosperity that the US and Kabul envisages. That’s a sham. Pakistan is just one regional player. There are others: the US itself, Iran, Russia, China and India. At least three, Iran, Russia and China, consider the Taliban political actors. Iran and Russia also fund and arm certain Taliban groups, a fact known to and stated by US officials. But let’s keep that aside and see the options the US can use to coerce Pakistan. US leverage over Pakistan is on the wane Two are upfront: aid and coalition support fund. Both are down to a trickle. In fact, Islamabad as well as the General Headquarters (Pakistan Army) have told multiple US civil and military delegations that Pakistan is not interested in US aid or military support. There are no big-ticket items involved since the US Congress scuttled the financing for the sale of Block C&D F-16s. The US has already exhausted any leverage there. The other possibility is withdrawing the major non-NATO ally status. In real terms, given the state of relations since 2011, this does not mean anything, not even in a symbolic sense. What else? This is where the coercive possibilities come in. There’s been much debate in a months-long review of how to deal with Pakistan. There are two schools of thought: one, which is the driver of the current policy, rejects Pakistan’s strategic concerns and advocates arm-twisting Pakistan to force Islamabad to fall in step; the other believes that putting Pakistan in the doghouse will make matters worse and the US must be sympathetic to Pakistan’s perceptions while impressing upon Islamabad its concerns and find a balance grounded in quid pro quos. The coercion, therefore, is likely to be graduated. In his speech, Trump said that he is lifting restrictions on how field commanders must operate in terms of the challenges they face. This means giving US commanders a free hand in determining how to identify and neutralise threats. Read in conjunction with Trump’s statement that Pakistan harbours ‘terrorists and criminals’ on its soil, the US could begin drone attacks outside of the air bands in which Pakistani governments have secretly been allowing US drones to operate. This could mean attacks in settled areas and cities: Peshawar, Bannu, Kohat, Quetta, Kuchlak, or even Karachi. If this does not have the desired result, the US could begin taking measures for what Dr Moeed Yusuf has called ‘soft diplomatic isolation’. Such measures could include sanctioning individuals and entities, especially military and intelligence officials (that would mean restricted travel, freezing of assets and even arrests on foreign soils), putting the squeeze by withdrawing support from international financial institutions, pushing a resolution through the United Nations Security Council, among other things. Given the upcoming bleak economic picture painted by independent economists, most pointing to a looming balance of payment crisis, Pakistan, according to them, will need to go back to the International Monetary Fund. That’s another area where Pakistan could be squeezed. The final and most extreme measure, as advocated by some in the US, could be to declare Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism. That would be a clear break in a long-troubled relationship. What happens next will draw the battle lines. Trump might make things worse Whether any or all of this will give the US the ‘win’ Trump thinks he can still pocket is of course an illusion. It won’t because it can’t. What’s deeply ironic is that coercing and trying to isolate Pakistan will only worsen the problem. Pakistan, in conjunction with its regional allies, could either take a tougher position by aligning its interests with theirs or, worst-case scenario, get destabilised. Neither development is savoury for policymakers in Washington, or for the region. China already knows that the US is propping India up as a countervailing force. That doesn’t go down well with Beijing. Hopefully, it will not come to that. While Pakistan’s official response will be formulated after the National Security Committee meeting, chaired by the prime minister, the initial reaction, in seeking to work with the US has, nonetheless, rejected the allegations trotted out by Trump. The statement also references Jammu and Kashmir as the core dispute thereby pointing to tense Pakistan-India relations as a major source of instability in the region. The expectation seems to be that Trump’s speech was not the policy but its salient features. The policy will have its nuances and multiple tools. Rex Tillerson wants to engage Pakistan to discuss the play. That’s where the two sides could figure out what’s possible and what’s not. But there’s the wild card, Trump, who is now being played by McMaster and the hardliners in the White House. If they prevail, the region gets a problem that will make the current situation look like a teddy bear’s picnic.

News article:
New US policy on Pakistan is old, and has just one wild card: Trump himself The US has consistently hid behind the idea that Pakistan is the biggest obstacle to peace in Afghanistan. This notion is narrow, deeply flawed, and creates internal contradictionsand failuresin US policy in the region. Speaking at Fort Myer on Monday about his Afghanistan policy, US President Donald Trump has put Pakistan on notice. While acknowledging that Pakistan has been a valued partner in the past, he has, like his predecessor, Barack Obama, accused Pakistan of harbouring ‘criminals and terrorists’ and said “our new strategy [will] change the approach and how to deal with Pakistan.” In 2009, President Barack Obama said much the same. So, what’s new? Trump. Trump is the new feature in this policy, not because he has found an Open Sesame to the problem of Afghanistan and, by extension, the region, but because he will make a wicked problem wickeder through an internally incoherent policy. Consider. For a long time the thinking in some circles in Washington has been to accuse Pakistan for US failures in Afghanistan. This line of argument is also trotted out by Indian and Afghan analysts. If Pakistan reins in the Taliban and the Haqqanis, Afghanistan’s political and security landscape will become salubrious for the kind of peace and prosperity that the US and Kabul envisages. That’s a sham. Pakistan is just one regional player. There are others: the US itself, Iran, Russia, China and India. At least three, Iran, Russia and China, consider the Taliban political actors.

News article:
Trump's Afghanistan policy has the potential to alter the geopolitical balance in the volatile region. Pakistan, criticized by Trump for "Islamist support," wants greater involvement from China in the Afghan conflict. While many security and foreign policy analysts criticized US President Donald Trump's Afghanistan policy for lacking a clear-cut strategy, it is nonetheless unequivocal about Islamabad's "lack of cooperation" with Washington over the alleged Taliban sanctuaries inside Pakistan. Trump's predecessors, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, were also skeptical of Pakistan's "double game" regarding its "Islamist support" and alliance with the West, but analysts say that none of them had turned it into a policy cornerstone the way Trump has done. Trump could order unilateral airstrikes on militant targets inside Pakistan and cut Islamabad's military aid or even impose sanctions on government and military officials for "backing" US-designated terrorist groups. Read more: The war for Afghanistan: Washington's successes and setbacks Pakistan, naturally, is angered by Trump's claims that it harbors terrorists that make it difficult for the US to succeed in Afghanistan. The government and opposition parties slammed the US president and even threatened that their country could chose to break ties with Washington. The South Asian country's foreign minister, Khwaja Asif, will embark on a three-day official tour of China, Russia and Turkey for consultations over Trump's Afghanistan policy. The latest developments show the new US strategy, which seeks a bigger role for Pakistan's archrival India in the conflict, would radically change the geopolitical alignments in the region. It could destabilize South Asia even more by putting China and Pakistan on a bigger collision course with Afghanistan and India. Analysis: Trump lays out new Afghanistan strategy To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Afghanistan – the main stakeholder The Afghan government, however, has welcomed the United States' continued engagement in their country, and also the fact that finally a US administration has officially recognized Pakistan as a major problem – something that Afghan officials have been repeatedly pointing at. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's government is hopeful the new regional approach will help resolve the protracted conflict. "The new strategy has identified threats and challenges the region faces and, therefore, we believe Afghanistan and the US would benefit from it in the long run," said Shah Hussain Martazawi, a spokesman for Ghani. "The strategy also identifies countries that have not played their role in the fight against terrorism responsibly," Martazawi added, in an apparent reference to Pakistan. Read more: Donald Trump's 'new strategy' for Afghanistan receives mixed reactions in Europe, Kabul But will Trump really put pressure on Islamabad? And more importantly, what leverage does the US have on Pakistan to make it comply with its demands? "I think President Trump made it very clear to Pakistani authorities that they must openly take sides in the conflict. If Islamabad continues to provide safe havens to insurgents and does not cooperate in ending the Afghan conflict, it will face very harsh consequences," Wadir Safi, a lecturer at Kabul University, told DW's Pashtu-Dari service. Afghan authorities have welcomed continued US engagement in their country Image: picture-alliance/dpa/G. Habibi Is Pakistan's 'help' necessary? Pakistanis are confident the US would continue to rely on its "assistance" in the Afghan war. Washington has so far cooperated with Pakistan knowing the sanctions or unilateral aerial attacks on the militants' hideouts in the country could further destabilize the nuclear-armed nation with high anti-West sentiments. During his tenure, former US President Obama had increased drone attacks in Pakistan's northwestern tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, but he continued to engage with Pakistani authorities to keep leverage on the country. The flipside to it, analysts say, is that Islamabad continued with its own strategy for Afghanistan: minimizing New Delhi's influence in Kabul and waiting for complete US withdrawal from the country. Read more: What is Pakistan's militancy issue all about? At the same time, some Pakistani analysts say it is in the interest of Islamabad to also keep the Trump administration on its side. "I think there is no point in getting excited over Trump's Afghanistan policy speech. Pakistan should engage with him. He is sending more soldiers to Afghanistan and for that America will need Islamabad's help," Pakistani researcher and defense analyst Aisha Siddiqa, told DW's Urdu service. Will the Pakistani military, which calls the shots in the country, try a middle way with Trump? Image: picture-alliance/AA/ISPR US-Pakistani ties have been tense since former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden's killing in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in 2011. After Trump's policy speech, the differences have become official. Knowing that Washington's reliance on Pakistan was diminishing, Islamabad already forged closer ties with Beijing. Now that China is investing heavily in Pakistan – the multibillion dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project is one example of this partnership – Pakistan also feels less dependent on the US. "The tension between Pakistan and the US is likely to increase, but Washington will soon realize it cannot isolate Pakistan. If Trump attempts to do that, Pakistan, China and Russia could form an alliance, which could also include Iran, Turkey and some Central Asian states," Inam ur Raheem, a retired Pakistani army official, told DW. Chinese interest in Afghanistan Ye Hailin, an expert at the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, believes hostility between the regional powers could be counterproductive in defeating terrorists. "As a mediator between Pakistan and Afghanistan, China has always tried to do its best. China's strategic interest in the region is to defeat terrorism," Ye told DW's Chinese service. Ye said Pakistan was contributing to the international anti-terror campaign. "The US accusations are highly unfair. Washington's financial aid to Pakistan is not for charity; NATO forces are using Pakistan's assistance for transportation and fuel," he added. China is already part of a Quadrilateral Coordination Group - comprising Afghanistan, China, Pakistan and the United States - that was established to end the protracted Afghan crisis. The grouping has not achieved any significant breakthrough so far, with Islamabad and Kabul at loggerheads over the militancy issue, and Beijing and Washington lacking trust. Read more: 'China and Russia want US out of Afghanistan' Experts say that China has invested heavily in Pakistan, and that is why it wants peace in at least those areas where its "One Belt One Road" project is being implemented. China has built a port in the southwestern Pakistani province of Baluchistan as part of its nearly 60-billion-dollar CPEC project to establish overland and sea trade routes to reach Middle Eastern, European and African markets. It is unclear what role Trump has envisioned for India in Afghanistan Image: Reuters/K. Lamarque Another reason for Beijing's diplomatic efforts in Afghanistan is its concerns about Islamists operating in China's Xinjiang region and their alliance with the Taliban and other Islamist groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan. While Chinese authorities enjoy tremendous influence on Pakistan's civilian and military establishments, Afghanistan is still closer to the United States. Thus, bringing Kabul and Islamabad onto the same page over an Afghan solution won't be easy for Beijing. Opting for neutrality Qamar Agha, a New Delhi-based Afghanistan expert, told DW's Hindi service that Pakistan considered India the main enemy, and knowing that the US wanted India to play a bigger role in Afghanistan, it was logical that Islamabad would get closer to Beijing. "Pakistani authorities think that cooperating with China would be more useful for them in this scenario than working with the US. China, too, is supporting Pakistan on all regional and international forums," the expert underlined. Agha, however, says it is unclear what Trump wants from India regarding Afghanistan. At the same time, Indian and Pakistani peace activists urge their countries to tread cautiously and not become a party to the US-Chinese rivalry and the global powers' strategic interests in Afghanistan and Central Asia. For instance, renowned Pakistani activist and author Harris Khalique has time and again urged a regional solution to regional conflicts without interference from Beijing, Moscow or Washington.

News article:
By Iran Review By Ja’far Haqpanah* The present-day Afghanistan is still a center of instability and insecurity. Expansion of military operations by the Taliban and Daesh groups to western and northern parts of Afghanistan indicates the failure of the country’s reconstruction effort and state building project and proves vulnerability of security state of Afghanistan. It is also especially the sign of a grave human security crisis in the country. The results of this situation at domestic levels have been nothing but continuation of immigration crisis, persistent corruption and inefficiency of state institutions, in addition to unprecedented increase in plantation and production of illicit drugs. However, this is not the whole story. Interconnection among domestic, regional and international aspects of the crisis in Afghanistan is such that it can rapidly jeopardize all security complexes in West Asia and even at international level on a large scale. This interconnection and negative impact of the situation in Afghanistan was for a short time overshadowed by the surge of extremist terrorism and emergence of Daesh in Iraq and Syria. As a result of that situation, Afghanistan was somehow drive out of the focus of attention of both politicians and analysts. However, now that the so-called Daesh caliphate is in decline in Iraq and Syria, the issue of Afghanistan has once again regained its determining importance in shaping regional and international security arrangements. Therefore, major questions that arise here are: What impact can the ongoing developments in Afghanistan have on periphery of the country and international security? Will Afghanistan move toward more stability in the post-Daesh era, or will it turn into a center for reproduction of new forms of sectarian terrorism? And finally, what should be the position and responsibility of other governments involved in the issue of Afghanistan? Domestic and regional dimensions of insecurity in Afghanistan According to reports released by the majority of analysts and international institutions, a sharp increase in activities of the Taliban and Daesh groups in 2017 has led to increased insecurity in Afghanistan in addition to soaring civilian casualties and reduced control of the central government on border provinces. As a result, in addition to southern provinces, the Taliban militants are now trying to expand their control over the northern parts of the country and, along with the Haqqani network, are considered as the main causes of insecurity in the country. Therefore, in spite of the fact that Hekmatyar’s group has already joined the peace process in the country, no clear prospect is currently on the horizon for improvement of the existing situation in Afghanistan. One reason for the current situation is the increased activities of Daesh in this South Asian country. Up to a year ago, no serious attention was paid to gradual infiltration of Daesh into Afghanistan, which has been called Wilayat Khurasan by this terrorist group. However, the power void in the country, on the one hand, and the long history of presence and communications among various groups of extremist terrorists on the two sides of the Durand Line, on the other hand, have made Afghanistan a totally attractive location for members of these extremist groups. We must especially bear in mind that a group of Daesh members come from extremists in Central Asia and China’s Xinjiang province, who have always used Afghanistan both as a passage and as a place for training and logistics. Some analysts believe that given the background of Taliban’s presence in Afghanistan and the social status that the group enjoys in the country, chances for Daesh to be able to establish its standing in Afghanistan are infinitesimal, because the Taliban group has proved in the past that it is not willing to lose its territory even at the cost of bloody conflicts with rivals. However, we must not forget that sectarian terrorism in Iraq and Syria managed to thrive despite all primary expectations and predictions by taking advantage of the power void and existing discontent among people in those countries. Of course, hefty financial aid pouring in from outside of those countries was also a very effective factor in growth of such groups. In the meantime, the Taliban lacks its past power and consolidation as a result of which it is quite possible for some disgruntled members of the group to joint Daesh. Under these conditions, the two groups’ mutual need to each other in order to fight a common enemy may lay the ground for tactical and regional cooperation between them despite all their differences and internal rivalries. Reports released so far about the cooperation between Daesh and the Taliban for seizing the strategic district of Mirza Olang in Afghanistan’s Sar-e Pol province in August further corroborate this possibility. As a result, the present circumstances in Afghanistan can be compared to the situation in Iraq during 2010-14, and under these circumstances, the Taliban and Daesh are expected to take the following steps separately or in cooperation with each other: Spreading terrorism through boisterous operations in provincial centers and other populous areas; Showing off their power by carrying out operations in important districts both in cities and out of cities against civilians, military bases as well as political and diplomatic centers, examples of which included operations in Wazir Akbar Khan district of Kabul, the attack on a military base in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, and recent operations in Mirza Olang district; Fanning the flames of sectarian and religious war by conducting multiple operations against people holding religious rituals as well as against Iran’s offices in that country and Central Asia; Conquering land on the margins of cities and major provinces in order to establish their bases and leaders and also to mount pressure on the central government. Of course, they are currently not able to control big and populous cities and, therefore, conquering entire cities will not be on their agenda. Responsibility of regional and international powers in Afghanistan The Taliban and Daesh are expanding their activities at a time that the US-led international coalition’s forces have been proven inefficient and without initiative and, in practice, have no clear-cut strategy in the war-stricken country. This comes despite promises the coalition forces have given to maintain stability and security in Afghanistan and in spite of the fact that they have been paying material and human costs of their efforts. On the other hand, existence of serious doubts and differences within Trump’s administration about the United States’ new strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan has created new problems. This comes despite the fact that when Trump’s administration was inaugurated, officials in Afghanistan were highly optimistic because of the higher attention that the United States showed in their country’s problems. That optimism was further increased due to presence of such people as General Thomas F. Metz, Director of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Mike Pompeo, and General Herbert Raymond McMaster in Trump’s administration. However, since Trump’s foreign policy is mostly mercantilist in nature, it is not likely that Afghanistan will have a very important position in that policy due to its high costs and low benefits for the United States. This is especially true under conditions when the United States lacks a grand strategy for West Asia region and, due to this reason, nobody can expect any special change to take place in Washington’s policies and actions in this regard. Opportunities for international cooperation against the common threat posed by the Taliban and Daesh Under these conditions, it seems that the country is in for seeing a new surge in instability and insecurity. The two main factors that make this very probable include the high possibility of a shift in position and deployment of some Takfiri terrorists from Iraq and Syria to Afghanistan, on the one hand, and the weakness of the Afghan government combined with lack of serious determination to fight terrorists on the part of the US-led coalition and NATO forces, on the other hand. Of course, this issue can, per se, be considered as a serious threat at all three domestic, regional and international levels, but at the same time, it can be viewed as an opportunity as well because, like what happened in 2002, it can provide grounds for more cooperation and coordination among effective regional and international actors in Afghanistan. In the meantime, the Islamic Republic of Iran enjoys remarkable capabilities and abilities for fighting against extremism and Daesh. Therefore, if big powers avoid taking a unilateral approach in this regard, Iran can play a very constructive and positive role. One of the main reasons behind inadequacy of efforts made in the past decade to build security in and reconstruct Afghanistan has been ignoring the role of regional powers. Therefore, a feeling of common threat from extremist terrorism in Afghanistan by all regional and global powers can be taken as a basis for new cooperation, which may be the last chance for this country and the entire region to come up with new security arrangements on the basis of consensus and maximum cooperation among influential actors. *Ja’far Haqpanah Visiting Professor of Regional Studies; University of Tehran

In a strong endorsement of India's stand, the five-member BRICS group on Monday issued a declaration that for the first time that highlighted its shared concerns on terrorism emanating from Pakistan-based terror outfits. The Xiamen declaration stopped short of naming Pakistan but listed specific terror organisations based there, in a message surprisingly backed by host China, despite its past diplomatic shielding of its 'all-weather' ally from global pressure on terror. This came as Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the scourge of terror in an intervention at a summit meeting of the five leaders, which opened in the beautiful seaside city of Xiamen on Monday morning. Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan greet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi before the welcoming banquet for the BRICS Summit, in Xiamen, China The 30-page declaration, running into nearly 7,500 words, expressed concern on violence caused by 'the Taliban, ISIS, al- Qaida and its affiliates, including Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement, Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the Haqqani network, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e- Mohammad, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Hizb ut- Tahrir. 'This is the first time that it has listed specific organisations,' Preeti Saran, secretary (East) in the ministry of external affairs, told reporters. The declaration also called for 'increasing the effectiveness' of United Nations designations of terror groups. Whether this will see a change in China's stand at the UN Security Council, where it has for more than a year blocked India's application to list JeM chief Masood Azhar, remains to be seen. (L-R) Brazil's President Michel Temer, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, South Africa's President Jacob Zuma and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pose during the BRICS Summit at Xiamen International Conference and Exhibition Centre Chinese foreign ministry officials couldn't confirm if this would signal a change in China's approach when the listing is reviewed next month. The declaration also implicitly backed India's stand on its accession to the Nuclear Suppliers Group, stressing the need for a predictable environment for access to civilian nuclear technology and financing. The BRICS leaders met amid global attention on North Korea following its sixth nuclear test on the eve of the summit. The declaration said the countries 'strongly deplore' the test, but also echoed China's view that the Korean peninsula nuclear issue 'should only be settled through peaceful means and direct dialogue of all the parties concerned'. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers a speech ahead of the signing ceremony of the BRICS Business Council at the BRICS Summit in Xiamen President Vladimir Putin (R) shakes hands with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (L) during their meeting at the BRICS summit on Monday Earlier on Monday, the PM called on the BRICS countries to step up their economic cooperation and described the five emerging nations as a source of stability in an increasingly uncertain world. The PM also highlighted India's fight against black money and corruption, and a later BRICS business council meeting, said the GST reform was India's 'biggest economic reform measure ever' and had 'in one stroke created a unified market'. The PM also spoke of programmes like Digital India, Start Up India and Make in India. The summit concluded with several outcomes on boosting economic and financial cooperation, including credit ratings under the BRICS interbank cooperation mechanism and an interbank local currency credit line. The PM held bilateral talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Brazil President Michel Temer. Modi will also hold a meeting with the President of Egypt, which is among the five counties – Mexico, Guinea, Thailand and Tajikistan – invited by China as part of 'BRICS Plus' outreach exercise. His last engagement is a bilateral with President Xi Jinping before he flies out for Myanmar on Tuesday afternoon. India and China look for a new chapter of mutual accord As Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived on a rainy Sunday evening in the picturesque Chinese coastal city of Xiamen, Chinese officials said they hoped his bilateral meet with Chinese president Xi Jinping would open 'a new chapter' in ties. Modi and Xi are set to meet on Tuesday morning following the Sunday's BRICS Summit, and both sides are looking to turn the page after the 72-day stand-off at Doklam.

Modi was welcomed at Xiamen airport by Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou and the Chinese envoy to India Luo Zhaohui Due to heavy rain, the PM embarked not from the usual stairs but through an aerobridge. Ahead of the PM's arrival, Luo, the Chinese envoy, 'expressed his hope that China and India could open a new chapter in the development of bilateral relations taking the forthcoming 9th BRICS summit as an opportunity', the State-run Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying. Luo said 'frequent interactions' between the two leaders - Xiamen will host their ninth meeting - had 'greatly pushed forward pragmatic cooperation' and 'enhanced political mutual trust'. Handshakes at dawn: The damage the 10-week troop Doklam standoff inflicted on the already frayed India-China relationship will not be easy to repair Modi will attend the opening of the BRICS Summit today, and over the two days in Xiamen, will also hold several key bilateral meetings before he leaves for Myanmar on Tuesday afternoon. Besides Xi, the PM will meet with Russia's president Vladimir Putin, as well as the presidents of Egypt and Brazil, and K.V. Kamath, the president of the BRICS New Development Bank. The end of the Doklam stand-off ahead of the BRICS Summit has been a source of relief for Beijing, which did not want to see the summit get overshadowed. Beijing had in the lead up to the summit toned down its sharp rhetoric. At the same time, certain hawkish sections of the press have called for Beijing to not play down the row and to celebrate what they call their 'victory'. 'The settlement of the Doklam was undoubtedly a victory for China after it pressured India into ending its speculative tactical intervention in the border region via military, diplomatic and other means,' said a commentary in the Global Times. 'It was a comprehensive demonstration of China's major-country strategy, and the wisdom and the ability of the Chinese leadership. It is no less significant than the armistice of the Korean War (1950-53), or the conclusion of the 1979 China's self-defence war against Vietnam, especially given its peaceful resolution.' 'In this instance,' the commentary added, 'China's concerns that playing tough with India could have jeopardised the BRICS Summit, may instead have bolstered New Delhi's arrogance and paved the way for it to create a scene for China at the summit.'

News article:
In a strong endorsement of India's stand, the five-member BRICS group on Monday issued a declaration that for the first time that highlighted its shared concerns on terrorism emanating from Pakistan-based terror outfits. The Xiamen declaration stopped short of naming Pakistan but listed specific terror organisations based there, in a message surprisingly backed by host China, despite its past diplomatic shielding of its 'all-weather' ally from global pressure on terror. This came as Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the scourge of terror in an intervention at a summit meeting of the five leaders, which opened in the beautiful seaside city of Xiamen on Monday morning. Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan greet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi before the welcoming banquet for the BRICS Summit, in Xiamen, China The 30-page declaration, running into nearly 7,500 words, expressed concern on violence caused by 'the Taliban, ISIS, al- Qaida and its affiliates, including Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement, Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the Haqqani network, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e- Mohammad, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Hizb ut- Tahrir. 'This is the first time that it has listed specific organisations,' Preeti Saran, secretary (East) in the ministry of external affairs, told reporters. The declaration also called for 'increasing the effectiveness' of United Nations designations of terror groups. Whether this will see a change in China's stand at the UN Security Council, where it has for more than a year blocked India's application to list JeM chief Masood Azhar, remains to be seen. (L-R) Brazil's President Michel Temer, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, South Africa's President Jacob Zuma and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pose during the BRICS Summit at Xiamen International Conference and Exhibition Centre Chinese foreign ministry officials couldn't confirm if this would signal a change in China's approach when the listing is reviewed next month. The declaration also implicitly backed India's stand on its accession to the Nuclear Suppliers Group, stressing the need for a predictable environment for access to civilian nuclear technology and financing. The BRICS leaders met amid global attention on North Korea following its sixth nuclear test on the eve of the summit. The declaration said the countries 'strongly deplore' the test, but also echoed China's view that the Korean peninsula nuclear issue 'should only be settled through peaceful means and direct dialogue of all the parties concerned'. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers a speech ahead of the signing ceremony of the BRICS Business Council at the BRICS Summit in Xiamen President Vladimir Putin (R) shakes hands with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (L) during their meeting at the BRICS summit on Monday Earlier on Monday, the PM called on the BRICS countries to step up their economic cooperation and described the five emerging nations as a source of stability in an increasingly uncertain world. The PM also highlighted India's fight against black money and corruption, and a later BRICS business council meeting, said the GST reform was India's 'biggest economic reform measure ever' and had 'in one stroke created a unified market'. The PM also spoke of programmes like Digital India, Start Up India and Make in India. The summit concluded with several outcomes on boosting economic and financial cooperation, including credit ratings under the BRICS interbank cooperation mechanism and an interbank local currency credit line. The PM held bilateral talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Brazil President Michel Temer. Modi will also hold a meeting with the President of Egypt, which is among the five counties – Mexico, Guinea, Thailand and Tajikistan – invited by China as part of 'BRICS Plus' outreach exercise. His last engagement is a bilateral with President Xi Jinping before he flies out for Myanmar on Tuesday afternoon. India and China look for a new chapter of mutual accord As Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived on a rainy Sunday evening in the picturesque Chinese coastal city of Xiamen, Chinese officials said they hoped his bilateral meet with Chinese president Xi Jinping would open 'a new chapter' in ties. Modi and Xi are set to meet on Tuesday morning following the Sunday's BRICS Summit, and both sides are looking to turn the page after the 72-day stand-off at Doklam. Modi was welcomed at Xiamen airport by Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou and the Chinese envoy to India Luo Zhaohui.

News article:
While some of the commentary in the United States on the content of President Donald Trump’s August 21 speech on the Afghan strategy may have dismissed it simply as old wine in a new bottle, there is little doubt that if all the elements it articulated become the United States’ policy, there will be enormous consequences for South Asia. We can already spot at least half a dozen of these. I will mention these and then briefly discuss them.First, the on-going war in Afghanistan will not have a clear winner for years to come. There will be more destruction and more contestants will be drawn into the fray. These will probably include the Islamic State (IS) as that organisation of extremists, squeezed in Iraq and Syria, seeks new grounds for its continued existence. A troubled Afghanistan will offer an attractive place from where to launch operations possibly into South Asia. The IS could also find the ground in the Indian-occupied Kashmir throwing the welcoming mat.Second, the Americans are unlikely to extend their stay in Afghanistan for any length of time. The strategy announced by President Trump was drafted by the senior military personnel who have joined his administration. The militarisation of the approach would not have civilian support, at least of the people who were behind the president’s ‘America First’ thinking. Some of these people — Stephen Bannon and Sebastian Gorka, for instance — have been pushed out of the White House by the president’s military associates. They have, however, not lost their influence in the Trump camp and are debating the wisdom of the Afghan policy. The August 21speech, therefore, may not be the final word. President Trump has not shown perseverance to be one of his strengths. He is likely to get tired of the course he has set for himself and his administration and call off the American involvement in Afghanistan.Third, in the meantime, the American rift with Pakistan will most likely become unbridgeable. This will be the case in particular if Imran Khan, not keen on keeping Pakistan closely aligned with the United States, gains political strength in the country. He has not made any secret of his desire to pull out of the US orbit.Fourth, Pakistan will get even closer to China as Beijing extends its reach in the country by way of the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative. The OBOR will prove to be a game changer for Pakistan even if the absence of peace in Afghanistan does not yield its full potential. Pakistan’s delinking from America and India’s drawing closeness to that country will reorder geopolitics in South and Central Asia. While the United States and India could become the main building blocks of what Donald Trump in his speech passingly referred to as the Indo-Pacific configuration, China, Russia and Pakistan may come together as partners in the other geographic configuration.Fifth, it is not totally unlikely that Iran will join this grouping, especially if the Trump administration continues in its attempt to isolate that country. From the perspective of the Muslim world, this may not be an unwelcome development as it will soften the sectarian divide that has been exacerbated by Trump’s Washington. The US president’s May speech in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, was read as an invitation to the Sunni world to align itself with the United States in the latter’s distrust of Tehran.It is the sixth consequence of Trump’s Afghan strategy that may prove to be most distressing. The pressure on Pakistan to do more to eliminate radical Islamists from its soil may produce an unintended result. The Pakistani military has been active in doing precisely that for the last couple of years, especially after the Afghan-based Taliban’s attack on an army school in Peshawar. The attack in December 2014 resulted in the launch of an operation by the country’s military on the Pakistani side of the border. In a conversation with me in May 2015, Ashraf Ghani said that the Pakistanis, while cleansing their areas of militants, have shoved the “world’s filth towards us in Afghanistan.” The reference was to the Islamists from Central Asia and Russia who had gathered in Pakistan’s North Waziristan to wage war against their perceived enemies. Dislocated, they have established havens in the border regions of Afghanistan. These are peopled by Pashtun tribes, a fact not fully comprehended by the West’s policymakers.The Taliban are Pashtuns. Numbering about 42 million, this ethnic group is divided between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan has 26 million Pashtuns, Afghanistan about 14 million. The remaining two million are spread over the world, in India and the Middle East. Like the Kurds in the Middle East, the Pashtuns have a distinct culture, language and history. If they are not made part of the Afghan polity and economy, which can be done by bringing in the Taliban into the system, they may create a political entity of their own, separate from the Afghan state. Unlike the Kurds, the Pashtun are strict observers of the Islamic faith. Their political entity would have a definite Islamic identity. Trump’s August speech may therefore create a quasi-autonomous state in the Pashtun areas on the Afghan side of the border pursuing a strong and uncompromising Islamic ideology. If that were to happen, there will be serious problems for both Afghanistan and Pakistan.Published in The Express Tribune, September 5, 2017.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.

News article:
KABUL: Iran provides arms and military equipment to Taliban guerrillas in Afghanistan, an army chief has claimed, marking the first confirmation from a high-ranking official of the war-torn country. President Ashraf Ghani raised the matter with his Iranian counterpart during his recent visit to Tehran, Lt. Gen. Mohammed Sharif Yaftali, chief of general staff for the Afghan National Army, told the BBC Persian Service. Yaftali said Kabul had documents showing “Iran was providing arms and military equipment to the Taliban in western Afghanistan.” He gave no further details. Some local officials in western Afghanistan in the past had spoken about Iran’s role in the Afghan war and its backing of the insurgents. Yaftali’s comments are however the first from a high-ranking Afghan official pointing to Iran’s alleged support for the Taliban. Taliban spokesmen were unavailable for comment, and the Iranian embassy in Kabul could not immediately be reached. Tehran, which opposes the presence of US troops in Afghanistan, has in the past rejected claims that it backs the Taliban. Dawlat Waziri, the chief spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense on Thursday said Yaftali’s comments were “misquoted” and that he expects a correction. He told Arab News that Afghanistan had “reports, not evidence about Iran’s involvement” and that it was verifying the reports. Others say however that there is firm evidence that Iran is supporting the fundamentalist political group. “Iranian land mines and weapons are used by the Taliban and it is directly engaged in supporting the Taliban militarily and financially,” analyst Bashir Bezhen told Arab News. “It has its reservations over water distribution with Afghanistan and secondly is locked in a deep rivalry with the US in Afghanistan. It wants to see the US defeat and ignominious withdrawal from Afghanistan.” Iran has long been at loggerheads with Kabul, often over water disputes. Much to Kabul’s anguish, Iran has in recent years officially hosted mid-ranking Taliban commanders at gatherings of Islamic scholars. Reports of its military and financial backing of the Taliban have increased ever since Ghani’s government signed a strategic security pact with Washington in 2014. Former Taliban leader Akhtar Mansour, who was killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan last year, was reportedly en-route there from Iran where, according to media reports, many mid-ranking Taliban commanders have transferred their families to live. Some Afghan observers say Iran is part of a regional block pushing the withdrawal of US troops that overthrew the Taliban regime 16 years ago in Afghanistan.

News article:
Islamabad: Pakistan will introduce a paradigm shift in its foreign policy in the wake of the US strategy announced by US President Donald Trump last month, Foreign Affairs Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif has said, adding the country would not allow anyone to make it a scapegoat. The nation will have to swiftly “change its direction”, Asif said yesterday at the conclusion of a three-day conference of Pakistani envoys in Islamabad, referring to the changing geopolitical situation. Pakistan’s ambassadors from China, Russia, Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Belgium and the United Arab Emirates participated in the conference to deliberate on key foreign policy issues following US President Donald Trump’s new Afghan policy besides the Kashmir and regional situation. New narrative A “new foreign policy narrative” has been evolved which is aimed at bridging the gap between Pakistan and international community on war against terrorism. Since “There is a difference — a distance — between the international perception and Pakistan’s perception [of the war],” Asif said discussing Pakistan’s contribution in the war against terror. The US policy on South Asia and Afghanistan was discussed during the final meeting of the envoys conference and Pakistan’s ambassador to the United States, Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, delivered a briefing on the situation following US President Trump’s statements. Discussing the new US Afghan policy, Asif said Washington should respect Pakistan’s territorial integrity. “We are not cutting ties with the US, but will ensure Pakistan’s interests. We want to maintain bilateral relations based on mutual respect with all countries, including the US,” the foreign minister maintained. “We want to stay engaged with the United States. We have had a long relationship with them, spanning 70 years,” he stated but regretted that Washington does not have a full comprehension of the facts. “In my personal view, [in the course of this history], we have only incurred losses and haven’t gained much,” he said. However, he added that the consultation process between the two countries must continue as “we are friends”. He also mentioned the huge losses incurred by Pakistan in the war on terror. “We are the only country in the world which is winning the war on terror, and we will continue winning it,” said Asif while lauding Pakistan’s performance in the war on terror as a third-world nation with limited resources. The foreign minister also said that coalition forces in Afghanistan numbered more than 100,000 but could not achieve the same level of success. “If more than 100,000 soldiers from 16 countries could not succeed [in Afghanistan], we should not be blamed,” Asif remarked. “The war can be won with Pakistan’s experience and not without Pakistan’s cooperation,” Asif declared while referring to the 16-year long Afghan conflict. “They [US] are in a way oblivious to what is happening in the region. We will not accept the scapegoating of the Pakistani nation.” Besides, US relations, the participants of the three-day conference also discussed the United Nations and India. Pakistan-India relations have also been reviewed by the mMinistry in the context of the situation in occupied Kashmir. “Many friendly relations have supported us, including China and Turkey. We have reviewed relations with all countries and have decided to improve relations with those with whom our relations are not that good.” Geopolitical changes Keeping in view the major geopolitical changes as well as internal situation, Pakistan will evolve a new paradigm in foreign policy which will be presented in both Houses of Parliament for review, Asif said. Asif will be leaving for China tonight and will also visit Iran soon as international pressure mounts on Pakistan. During the visit, the foreign minister will hold meetings with China’s state councillor for foreign affairs Yang Jiechi and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has said the visit by Pakistan’s Foreign Minister will help strengthen bilateral relations between the two strategic partners in diverse fields.

News article:
Pakistan Says US Can't Win War on Terror Without It By Ayaz Gul September 07, 2017 Pakistan has vowed to stay engaged with the United States to help fight terrorism in neighboring Afghanistan, but said the war "cannot be won by excluding or confronting" Islamabad. Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif made the remark Thursday at the end of a three-day conference of Pakistani ambassadors to key world capitals for formulating a comprehensive response to the new U.S. policy on Afghanistan. U.S. President Donald Trump criticized Pakistan when he announced his long-awaited Afghan war policy last month. He accused Islamabad of harboring terrorists linked to the Taliban and Haqqani network, which are undermining U.S.-led efforts to stabilize Afghanistan and staging attacks on American forces. The charges have strained an already fragile relationship between Islamabad and Washington. "We want to stay engaged with the United States. There is absolutely no doubt about it ... But this relationship will be driven by the interest of Pakistan. We want to have a relationship based on mutual respect," Foreign Minister Asif told reporters after the meeting. He again rejected allegations his country is sheltering terrorists who are plotting deadly attacks in Afghanistan. Asif recounted Pakistan has lost thousands of its citizens, including security forces, and suffered massive economic losses while fighting terrorism. "I think people sitting in Washington have no comprehension of that ... I think they are oblivious, if not completely, at least partially oblivious of what actually is happening in this region," the foreign minister said. Asif urged the U.S. to respect Pakistan's sacrifices in the fight against terrorism and warned that "scapegoating" his country for "failures" of international forces to secure Afghanistan will be counterproductive. "They [the U.S.] should acknowledge Pakistan's counterterrorism gains and make use of our experience to win this war on terrorism because it can't be won by excluding or confronting Pakistan," the foreign minister asserted. Trump singled out Pakistan for not doing enough against militant groups operating on its soil but did not outline how he planned to pressure the country to move against the alleged terrorist sanctuaries on its soil. US put on notice U.S. media has reported a range of possible punitive measures under consideration, such as increasing diplomatic and economic pressure, and intensifying and expanding anti-terrorism drone strikes inside Pakistan. Asif warned against any coercive U.S. action. "We will defend our territorial integrity and we will not compromise our territorial integrity or our national dignity at any cost. And we expect from the U.S. to respect that," the foreign minister warned. He admitted that eliminating militancy from the entire Pakistani society will take time. "You have to change an entire culture created to fight the Afghan jihad in the 80s . You needed a state of mind to wage the jihad, so you deliberately created that state of mind through a state-sponsored program. Now you are trying to reverse it," Asif said. It takes time, he said, to "get rid of this baggage." The Pakistani minister was referring to the U.S.-backed Afghan insurgency against Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s. The American CIA in collaboration with Pakistan's spy agency, Inter- Services Intelligence or ISI, created, funded, trained and armed Afghans as well as volunteers from across the Muslim world to fight Soviet occupation forces, admitted Hillary Clinton while testifying as U.S. Secretary of State during a congressional hearing in April, 2009. ISI later used its ties with Afghan factions to try to influence affairs in Kabul during the civil war of the 1990s that gripped Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal. The Pakistani spy agency also allegedly used some of the home-grown militants to fuel a Muslim separatist insurgency in India-controlled portions of the divided Kashmir region. The backing from the powerful military establishment emboldened and enabled the militant groups to penetrate and extend influence in the mainstream Pakistani society, which has over the years become a major domestic security challenge and a source of spreading religious extremism, critics say. Afghans and U.S. officials have been skeptical about whether ISI would cut its covert ties with the Taliban and Haqqanis because Islamabad uses them to counter growing influence of rival India in Afghanistan. Foreign Minister Asif left for China, Pakistan's staunch ally, shortly after addressing reporters, saying his talks with Chinese officials will focus on the situation in the aftermath of Trump's August policy announcement.

Tehran: Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif on Monday urged regional countries to reach a consensus that could lead to the best solution to the Afghanistan problem. Asif made the remarks in an interview with Iran’s official Islamic republic News Agency (Irna). “Basically, my main purpose of the visit to Iran is to evolve some consensus amongst the neighbours of Afghanistan, because peace in Afghanistan will have a comprehensive effect on the rest of the region,” Asif said. The Pakistani top diplomat said the US military approach in Afghanistan has already failed to address the problems in the country. “No need to say that the approach taken by the Americans, which is a military one, has not been able to bring peace to Afghanistan [in] 16 years,” he said. “It is very important for us, it is very important for the region that we evolve consensus over different problems.” He said Pakistan believes that there can be no military solution to the Afghanistan problem, because a political solution is always a long-lasting one while a military solution will collapse soon. Asif said he reiterated on a political solution to the Afghanistan problem during his visit to China days ago. Asif said he will travel to Turkey on Tuesday to try his best to reach a regional consensus on Afghanistan. He added he also plans to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in the near future on the sidelines of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly session to discuss the Afghanistan issue. During his one-day visit to Tehran, Asif is expected to meet his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, and President Hassan Rouhani. In addition to the Afghanistan problem, the two sides will also discuss how to deal with the new US policy for Afghanistan and South Asia and promote the bilateral ties.

News article:
TEHRAN: Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif on Monday held separate meetings with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif after his arrival here on a day visit. According to TV reports, the foreign minister exchanged views with the Iranian leaders on the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and regional security scenario especially in the backdrop of new US strategy for Afghanistan and South Asia. National Security Adviser Nasser Janjua and Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua were present during the meetings. Talking to media after the meetings, he said Afghanistan’s neighboring countries would have to agree on joint efforts to cope with the Afghan problem. He said aim of his Tehran visit was to persuade the neighbors to hammer out consensus on some issues. The foreign minister said during his last week visit to China, he stressed the need to find a political solution to Afghan issue. He said he would also discuss Pakistan’s viewpoint during his visit to Turkey. He said peace in Afghanistan would have far reaching effects on the whole region. Khawaja Asif said US army has failed in resolving issues facing Afghanistan as there could be no military solution to the Afghan problem. He said no imported solutions couldn’t be effective. Earlier, Pakistan foreign office spokesperson said matters of mutual interests and regional situation and law and order situation in Afghanistan will come under discussion during the meetings. Last week, Asif delayed his meeting with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Washington. The Pakistani government also postponed the visit of Alice Wells, acting assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs, to Islamabad after US President Donlad trump's allegations against Pakistan. During his recent visit to China, Khawaja Asif has reiterated support for China's offer to host the first trilateral meeting of Foreign Ministers of Pakistan, China and Afghanistan later this year, focusing on strategic communication, practical cooperation, and security dialogue.

News article:
President Donald Trump's prime-time speech last month brought welcome attention to Afghanistan. But Afghanistan needs much more than attention. The country is in bad shape. The state is collapsing, civil conflict is widespread. The economy is decimated and heavily dependent on the drug trade. Tensions with Iran are growing, and there are multiple interventions from outside the country. Mired in civil war, it cannot exist without outside help, much of which is coming from the United States. The security situation has eroded, even in the capital of Kabul. Civilian deaths have reached record levels. The government controls barely half of the countryside. With our help, it has made a few gains but not enough. It is hard to see an end to the conflict. Advertisement There is a very real question as to whether Afghanistan's problems can be resolved. The United States has spent about $2 trillion in Afghanistan in the past 16 years. Some 2,400 American lives have been lost, and 20,000 of our service members have been wounded, many seriously. We are thought to currently have about 12,000 troops in Afghanistan, although the Pentagon has been less than fully transparent about the numbers. Yet most Americans have only the barest sense of what's going on in Afghanistan. For the most part, our politicians deem it to be unworthy of debate. They are content to let a handful of officials set policy. We don't seem to have grown weary of this never-ending war. We accept it: out of sight, out of mind. Trump seems to have doubled down on the policy we've pursued in recent years, but his speech was vague and lacked details about strategy. The goals he set, such as achieving victory over our adversaries and stabilizing the country, could take a lengthy, costly effort. Trump is giving broad flexibility to the military. He wants to avoid defeat above all else. He seems to be hoping that increasing military activity, sending more money, dropping more bombs and putting more pressure on Pakistan will bring victory. Advertisement Forswearing nation-building, Trump talks about integrating all the tools of policy, but it's not clear how he would use those tools to accomplish his goals. Sending a few thousand more troops, as he has ordered, could help at the margins, but it's unlikely to give the U.S. anything close to a clear win. The president says he wants to drive the Taliban to the negotiating table to work out a peace settlement, but the Taliban is gaining more territory and political influence, and becoming less likely to negotiate. No one in the U.S. government is willing to say it's time to get out of Afghanistan. It appears that the course we're on -- and the war -- will continue for years to come. The situation is grim, but cutting our losses and walking away is not the right approach. We have obligations to Afghanistan based on our involvement there for many years, and we want to offset the influence of Russia, Iran, Pakistan and others. Complete withdrawal would create a vacuum to be filled by the Taliban, ISIS, al-Qaida and other adversaries. But we should reshape our policy by defining more clearly our fundamental interests. From my perspective, our principal interest is seeing that the Taliban and other extremists do not establish safe havens from which they can attack us and our allies. We need to keep them on guard, off balance and on the run, and we need to clean out the terrorist sanctuaries -- goals that we can achieve with the use of intelligence, surveillance, air power, drones and, occasionally, U.S. Special Forces moving into and out of the country. We do not need to surge thousands more American forces. We should reduce our footprint in the country and seek ways to end the conflict. Advertisement We can keep trying to improve the quality of the Afghan military forces, help the government become more efficient and less corrupt, and end the factional fighting. And we need a regional effort that includes Russia, China, Iran and other countries with interests in Afghanistan. A helpful move would be to appoint a U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan. The lines of who has control and the question of who can speak for American policy are quite blurred right now.
