News article:
ISLAMABAD: The case of convicted Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav on Wednesday took another turn when India submitted its initial pleadings, known as ‘memorial’, to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague. Pakistan’s Attorney General Ashtar Ausaf, while talking to Geo Television, said India had sought until December to file its pleadings but the court allowed it until September 13 to do so. The ICJ also set December 13 as the deadline for Pakistan to submit its counter-pleadings in the case. On May 18, the ICJ ordered Pakistan to halt the execution of Jadhav, an on-duty Indian Navy officer working for Indian spy agency RAW, who was arrested from Balochistan in March 2016, until a final decision in the proceedings. It may be mentioned here that Kalbushan Jhadev, alias Hussain Mubarak Patel, serving as Commander of Indian Navy, working with Indian intelligence agency RAW, was apprehended on March 3, 2016 after he illegally crossed over into Pakistan from the Pakistan-Iran border. He was found in possession of an Indian passport issued by government of India on May 12, 2015 and valid until May 11, 2024. He confessed that he is a resident of Mumbai, India, still serving in the Navy and his retirement is due in 2022. The videos of his confession are widely circulated in the media. He is responsible for espionage, sabotage and terrorism in Pakistan and has been tried according to the law of the land, in a fully transparent manner by the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) under section 59 of Pakistan Army Act (PAA) 1952 and Section 3 of Official Secret Act of 1923. He confessed before a magistrate and the court that he was tasked by RAW to plan, coordinate and organise espionage and sabotage activities aimed at destabilising Pakistan. Commander Jhadev was involved in both espionage and terrorist/sabotage activities resulting in the loss of many lives and damage to property. According to details, he sponsored and directed IEDs and grenade attacks in Gwadar and Turbat. He also directed attacks on the radar station and civilian boats in the sea, opposite Jiwani Port. He funded subversive secessionist and terrorist elements through Hawala/Hundi for turning Pakistani youth against the country, especially in Balochistan. He sponsored explosions of gas pipelines/ electric pylons in in Balochistan. He sponsored IED explosions in Quetta in 2015, causing massive damage to life and property, and attacks on Hazaras in Quetta and Shia Zaireen en route to and back from Iran. He abetted attacks through anti-state elements against LEAs/FC and FWO in areas of Turbat, Punjgur, Gwadar, Pasni and Jiwani during 2014-2015, killing and injuring many civilians and soldiers. He launched a website with subversive content in support of anti-Pakistan elements. Pakistan has repeatedly requested India for assistance in the investigation process but to no avail. Subsequently, India took the case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) which after the oral hearing ruled on 18 May to grant provisional measures halting the execution of the Indian spy pending a final judgment of the court. As per the directives of the ICJ, India was required to submit its memorial in the Court on 13th September, 2017 while Pakistan will submit its counter memorial on December 13, 2017.

News article:
It is the most repeated maxim in all the reporting on Afghanistan: “The Americans have the watches, the Taliban have the time”. Dead right! This is America’s longest war ever: 16 years and counting. President Donald Trump, admitting he was reversing his campaign call for pulling out, has now decided to stay in, sending another 3,900 troops to Afghanistan to reinforce the 8,400 there now. Trump does not claim it will do the job of defeating the Taliban. In fact, he lays out no long-term strategy at all; it is not difficult to imagine that in a decade the same stalemate will exist. President Barack Obama, blindsided by the generals, he confided later, pumped up the numbers to 100,000. Before very long, Obama came to realise that even if he did a Lyndon B. Johnson and sent in half a million troops, it would have ended up as it did in Vietnam, with stalemate. He ordered the troops numbers down to their present total, the minimum to secure Kabul and provide training for the Afghan army. Unanswered was why, after 16 years and more than $120 billion spent, the Afghan army was not trained already. (One could ask the same question in Iraq.) Meanwhile, the Taliban gain territory and the number of civilians killed rises, as does the number of Taliban. An affiliate of Daesh is now getting itself established. Kabul seems more vulnerable to attack. The government is unable to get on top of the country’s three curses: vicious infighting by the warlords, corruption and poppy growing for heroin manufacture (it is now at an historic high and is 95 per cent of the world’s traded opium). Last year, 580,000 people fled their homes. A thousand schools were closed because of security concerns — most of them the hard work of Western governments aid programmes and NGOs. The cynics wonder whether the US and its NATO allies hang in only because they have their eyes on the apparent $1 trillion worth of minerals waiting to be mined. Eventually, wearied by failure, Obama and his generals came to believe that the only hope was reconciliation — negotiation between the Taliban, the government and the US, to find a compromise. The Taliban showed what they thought of that idea when they sent a missile in the direction of the visiting secretary of state, John Kerry. It is the same as it was in Vietnam. If the insurgents are not losing, they are winning. This is their home. The US and NATO are far from home. This is what the Soviet army found in its war in the 1980s. Only when Mikhael Gorbachev became president did the Kremlin have the guts to order a retreat. If one wants to know how terrible things became for the Red Army soldiers, one should read Nobel Prize winning author Svetlana Alexievich’s book “Zinky Boys”. The US and NATO are being undercut by Iran, which is supplying the Taliban with weapons, funds and fighters. Trump’s hostility to Iran ensures that this will grow. Russia, which for so long has supported the Americans, even allowing war materials to be transported on its railways, is now hedging its bets and making overtures to the Taliban. Pakistan plays both ends against the middle. On one side it is the main logistics route for America. On the other it tolerates the Taliban operating in parts of its northern territory. This dualism reflects its obsession with the growing Indian influence in Afghanistan, which Trump has just added to by announcing what Richard Nixon would have called a “tilt” towards India. Currently, the US is at war in at least seven Muslim countries. Non-Muslims forces fighting on Muslim land angers even moderate Muslims. In Somalia, US support for the Ethiopian invasion of Somalia provoked the earth-scorching Islamist Al Shabab group whose influence has spread far and wide outside Somalia. In Yemen, US and Saudi Arabian bombing (with planes and armaments from the US and the UK) has increased the number of fighters recruited by Al Qaeda. The argument of the American high command is that if the US gets out, extremists will take over; that is exaggerated. The North Vietnamese were not extremists. In the 1980s, the US military was in Lebanon fighting Hizbollah. A truck bomb blew up the US barracks, killing 241 soldiers. Not long after, president Ronald Reagan, realising that his troops were not improving the situation, withdrew his force. Lebanon calmed as Syrian diplomats and troops took over, although infighting among Lebanon’s factions continued. If the US and NATO left Afghanistan, the Taliban would take over. As happened after the Red Army left, there would be internecine warfare, with warlords competing for territory. Maybe girls’ schools would be closed. But as before when the Taliban ruled, poppy production would be banned. Plus one and minus the other. Not a good or tidy solution, but is Trump’s?

News article:
president Abdel fatah al Sisi (left) Somali president mohamed abdullahi farmaajo (right) CAIRO – 20 August 2017: First official visit of Somalia’s new President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo to Cairo on Sunday marks long and historical relations between the Egyptian and Somali nations. Egypt has been backing Somali’s decisions since 1960, according to State Information Service (SIS) website. A long list of bilateral cooperation relations was stated underneath the Egyptian Somali relations report, which included several official visits, scientific and cultural relations, economic relations and humanitarian aids. Egypt was one of the first states which recognized the independence of Somalia in 1960 after World War II; in addition Egypt continued backing Somalia in all different fields during the period that followed its independence. Several educational missions were sent to Mogadishu. In March 2013, former Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr marked a first visit for an official Egyptian to Somalia within twenty years. The visit included several meetings and talks with former Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud along with both foreign and defense ministers. Former Somali President visited Cairo four times during 2014 and 2015, as many cases of mutual interests were discussed between Sheikh Mohamud and his Egyptian counterpart Abdelfatah al-Sisi. Former Somali president Sharif Sheikh Ahmed also visited Egypt two times in 2009 and 2010. Several agreements and cooperation protocols were signed since the announcement of Somalian independence in 1960 with Egypt; SIS however listed the major nine agreements including (two trade agreements on December 1961 and July 1978, a cultural cooperation deal in January 1961, an aviation agreement in 1974, an economic agreement in 1982 and a cooperation protocol between the two countries federal radio and television.) Egypt has sent several humanitarian aids to its African neighbor according to SIS, the latest were during 2015 and 2017 to ease the impact of the drought wave that hit Somalia. Commenting on Sisi’s meeting with Farmajo, Sunday, Member of Parliament Ayman Aboul Ela said in a formal statement that “it is extremely important for the Egyptian government to establish balanced relations with our African neighbors and to communicate with them and enhance our relations in all different fields.” Sunday morning, President of Somalia Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo has arrived in Cairo for his first formal visit since taking office in February 2017. According to a presidential statement, the visit is aiming to enhance the Egyptian-Somali relations, as several issues are expected to be discussed during the talks between Farmajo and President Abdelfatah al-Sisi. A formal reception ceremony has been held in the Ittihadia Presidential Palace. On August 14, Sisi embarked on a four-day African tour where he visited Tanzania, Rwanda, Gabon and Chad. This tour however is not considered to be a sudden move, as Sisi visited several African countries since taking the office in June 2014; participating in summits and conducting bilateral talks with the majority of African leaders. In June 2014, Sisi participated in the African Union Summit in the Equatorial Guinea as his first presidential visit within the continent, which was considered then a restoration of the African-Egyptian relations after years of neglect during Mubarak’s era. Several short visits during 2015 followed the African Union Summit participation including, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda per Yuri Museveni’s invitation in December 2016.

The National Defense Minister of Sudan Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf- Official Facebook Page CAIRO - 20 August 2017: The National Defense Minister of Sudan Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf paid visit to Egypt on Monday to discuss the recent international and regional developments. The Minister of Defence Sedki Sobhy welcomed his counterpart Ibn Auf at the General Secretariat of the Defence Ministry. Ibn Auf has stressed the strong relations between Egypt and Sudan referring that his country is keen on enhancing the partnership between the two states in different fields and exerting efforts for the common interests, according to the Army Spokesperson’s official Facebook page. They discussed how the recent international and regional developments affect the security and stability in the region besides the common files of the Armed Forces. He stressed that the two countries should cooperate together to face challenges in the region to preserve security and stability of the region. He praised Egypt’s efforts and stances to fight terrorism preserving peace and security of Africa. Both countries have had a good relationship for decades, but tension arose between them when pro-Egyptian regime activists demonstrated against Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir after visiting Ethiopia, which is building a dam on the Nile, causing Sudan to impose entry visa requirements for Egyptians who are aged between 18 and 50 years.

Emerging from talks with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry in Minsk, Belarussian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei said "It is impossible to genuinely stabilize the Middle East without Egypt." Belarussian news agency BelTA quoted Makei as saying: “We are convinced that it is impossible to ensure genuine stability and tranquility in the Middle East without Egypt's participation. Egypt plays a pivotal role in this region. It has been confirmed by the concrete political actions the country's leaders take.” Makei underlined that Belarus sees Egypt as an important regional and international political player. “The fact that Egypt is home to 95 million people is self-explanatory. It is a powerful country. Egypt is indeed a major regional and international player,” said the Belarusian minister of foreign affairs.

Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and his Romanian counterpart Klaus Iohannis exchanged invitations to visit their respective countries in an effort to bolster ties, Egypt's foreign ministry spokesman said on Tuesday. The invitations were relayed through Egypt's foreign minister Sameh Shoukry, who concluded on Tuesday a visit to the Romanian capital Bucharest, where he spoke with President Iohannis. Shoukry presented Iohannis with a letter from El-Sisi inviting him "to visit Egypt at the earliest opportunity." During the talks, Shoukry asserted that Egypt looks forward to "boosting historic ties with Romania," and that Cairo relies on Romania's support as it pushes ahead with tough economic reforms, saying Bucharest is one of its key alleys in the European Union. The Romanian president invited El-Sisi to attend a presidential gathering on protecting youths against terrorism, which Romania is holding in September on the sidelines of a United Nations General Assembly meeting. Shoukry and Iohannis discussed regional issues including the crises in Syria and Libya and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, as well as Egypt's counterterrorism efforts. Bucharest is the third and last stop on Shoukry's European tour, which started on Sunday in Berlin, where he met German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel. The second stop was in the Belarussian capital Minsk, where Shoukry delivered a letter from El-Sisi to President Alexander Lukashenka, and met on Monday with the country's ministers of trade and foreign affairs.

News article:
"These narratives aren't mutually exclusive, and it's very possible that the SAA rightly conflates the SDF with Daesh due to the Kurds' documented connection with this terrorist organization. Moreover, the Kurds are ethnically cleansing Arabs from Raqqa en mass in order to pave the way for the city's annexation to their unilaterally declared "federation" after its forthcoming capture, so it makes sense why Damascus could implicitly recognize them as terrorists without publicly declaring them as such for reasons of sensitive political optics". Syria: Turkey: "Currently, the process in Idlib is being run as we agreed with Russia. There are no disputes with Russia on it. No controversy was brought to the agenda during our meeting with Iran". The United States: Russia: CONCLUSION: As ISIS crumbles in Syria, all eyes should be on America's inconsistent but growing relations with Syrian Kurds.Throughout the conflict in Syria, the Syrian Arab Army and its Russian/Iranian and Hezbollah allies have tended to operate in different regions vis-a-vis the Kurdish led US proxy army known as the SDF.Over the last year however, this has increasingly changed. As Syrian forces along with their allies continue to liberate Deir ez-Zor city which has been under ISIS occupation for the last three years, reports have surfaced indicating that a faction of the SDF is only a few short kilometres away from Syrian forces as the SDF approaches the city from the north.With the SDF and the Syrian Arab Army now effectively competing for territory which will be inevitably re-gained from ISIS by either force, the previous unspoken agreement that the SDF would more or less have free reign east of the Euphrates, might no longer apply. In many respects this is now a question of 'when' rather than 'if.Before exploring the answers to such questions, it is necessary to understand that according to international law, only the Syrian Arab Army and its allies have any right to operate in Syria.The first major test of how the SAA and SDF would interact with one another when coming face to face on the battlefield, took place in June of 2017.At that time, the United States illegally shot down a Syrian fighter jet which the US alleges fired on SDF positions. Syria however claims that it was firing on ISIS/Daesh positions.As geo-political expert Andrew Korybko pointed out at the time,Russia responded furiously to America's downing of the Syrian jet and issued a statement saying that any US aircraft flying west of the Euphrates were now legitimate targets . Since then, confrontations between Russia's Syrian partners and the US have generally de-escalated.The Russian statement regarding US aircraft being targeted seemed to enshrine the idea that areas west of the Euphrates were the Syria/Russian/Iranian sphere on influence while those to the east were the US/Kurdish sphere of influences.The answer to this lies in examining what each side wants or is perceived as wanting from the aftermath of the assured defeat of ISIS in eastern Syria.Any further discussions between Kurds and Damascus about regional autonomy can only be a post-war political discussion so far as Syria is concerned. Syria has grave concerns about the anti-Arab racism among many Kurds as Damascus ought to have. It is ultimately the duty of the Syrian government to protect its citizens from discrimination or anti-Arab propaganda. Even so, Damascus sees this as a civil issue rather than an issue of international conflict.While Turkey's continued presence in Syria, particularly in Idlib is still deeply unwelcome by Damascus, the nature of Turkey's goals in Syria have changed dramatically over the last several months.Most crucially, in August of this year, Turkey quietly withdrew support for terrorist factions (the so-called opposition) in Syria. While some expected this to pave the way for rapprochement between Damascus and Ankara, who prior to the conflict had no serious disagreements, both the Syrian and Turkish Presidents have recently rejected such claims.Turkey had, for most of the conflict been an effective state actor illegally occupying Syrian land and training terrorist groups who operated in some of the most strategically important parts of western, northern and north-central Syria.also, as Turkey's ruling elite have spent years positioning themselves in opposition to the ruling Arab Socialist Ba'ath party in Syria and all it stood for.That being said, Turkey's mission in Syria is now to prevent the consolidation of Kurdish militias. This itself is done in the service of Turkey's geo-strategic goal of preventing any Kurdish state from rising on its borders.At the same time, Turkey's President Erodgan who previously had serious disagreements with Russia over Syria, has now said that Turkey and Russia's position on Syria is now more or less the same.Erdogan stated this morning While Turkey and Syria will likely not directly cooperate against the Kurds any time soon, depending on US aims for its Kurdish proxies, one can certainly not rule out such a thing happening in the future.Ever since Donald Trump took office, the modus operandi of the US in Syria has shifted from using jihadists to foment regime change against the legitimate government in Damascus, to one of using Kurdish forces as proxies to create a would-be sphere of influence in parts of eastern and northern Syria.It is still less than clear what the US intends to do with this sphere of influence, if it even attains it. The fact that the SDF is having a much harder time fighting ISIS in Raqqa vis-a-vis the SAA in the more fortified Deir ez-Zor, is testament to the fact that ultimately while the SDF are better fighters than the jihdaists, they still are far less effective a fighting force than the legitimate Syrian Arab Army.Should the SDF conquer significant amounts of territory in Syria, the US would be in a position to argue for either hyper-Kurdish autonomy, beyond that which has already been established or otherwise, argue for the establishment of a Kurdish state.If the US pushed for a Kurdish state in Syria, what remains of the US alliance with Turkey would essentially be over. It is still not clear if this is something which concerns the Trump administration. This might be due to the foreign policy chaos which dominates Washington or because the US has designs on Turkey and Erdogan which may represent something resembling a soft regime change ambition in Ankara.Turkey is all too aware of America's odd behaviour vis-a-vis Turkey and no country in the region wants to see civil war in Turkey, much though the alt-media in parts of the secular and Shi'a Arab world and even among some genuine Russians might indicate something contrary to this.Now, the US is playing something of a ridiculous balancing act in Iraq where it is trying to placate historically decent (though often inconsistent) relations with Iraqi Kurds while trying to maintain America's substantial (however totally immoral) investment in Iraq which aims to see Iraq's borders preserved.America could still exploit political tensions between Iraqi and Syrian Kurds in order to say 'yes' to a Kurdish state in Syria but 'no' to one in Iraq, however, even by the standards of American hypocrisy, a great deal of geo-political tightrope walking would have to be embarked upon in order to achieve this.Russia is unique among all of the aforementioned powers as Russia has acceptable to good and historically very good relations with the Kurds of the Middle East. Russia of course also has good relations with Iran, Turkey, Syria, Israel ( the only entity in the region which covertly and sometimes overtly supports a Kurdish state ), Palestine and to a degree the United States. In other words, Russia can talk to all parties in the Middle East, including and especially those who do not speak to each other.The other side of this coin is that because Russia refuses to act as a puppet master of any one faction in the Middle East, both out of respect for international law and because Russia does not seek to appear as favouring any one faction, the aforementioned interests of each groups will inevitably collide and short of Russia acting as brazenly in Syria as America did and to an extent still does in Iraq, there is little Russia can do or will do.Every other state in the region is opposed to Kurdish separatism and therefore, should the Kurds seek to unilaterally declare independence in Syria, American aid both militarily and politically, is ultimately the only thing that could even come close to nullifying the position of Syria, Iran, Iraq and Turkey.While Russia officially adopts an agnostic position on a Kurdish state, Russia's increasingly good relations with Turkey and Iran mean that Russia may quietly shift to one of respectful opposition to a Kurdish state, perhaps arguing instead for a process of dialogue between Damascus and Kurdish rebel leaders.The old reality of Russia using the Kurds as leverage against Turkey and Iran, something which dates back to the 18th century, is increasingly not valid. Turkey's economic reliance on Russia for example has made it so that Russia has enough leverage against Turkey and also Iran, without resorting to any supine 'Kurdish threats'. That being said, Russia requires less leverage against either country than it once did and what leverage it does need can be achieved through Russia's good relations with secular Syria and its often discarded but relevant good relations with hysterically anti-Iran, Tel Aviv.Welcome to the Devil's Triangle.

News article:
UNITED NATIONS - Syria's foreign minister told world leaders Saturday that his country is "marching steadily" toward the goal of rooting out terrorism—and "victory is now within reach." Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Walid Muallem pointed to "the liberation of Aleppo and Palmyra," the end to the siege of Deir ez-Zour by the Islamic State extremist group, "and the eradication of terrorism from many parts of Syria" by the Syrian army and its supporters and allies, including Russia and Iran. Russia's military said about two weeks ago that Syrian troops have liberated about 85 percent of the war-torn country's territory from militants, a major turn-around two years after Moscow intervened to lend a hand to its embattled long-time ally. Syria's Foreign Minister Walid Muallem (Photo: AFP) Muallem heaped praise on the army and the country's allies and looked ahead to victory, though fighting still continues in many areas of the country. "I am confident that when this unjust war on Syria is over, the Syrian army will go down in history as the army that heroically defeated, along with its supporting forces and its allies, the terrorists that came to Syria from many countries and received large support from the most powerful countries of the world," he said. Israel, he said, was one of the countries supporting the rebels. "It gave them various forms of support—money, equipment, weapons, means of communications—and even bombed Syrian army posts in aid of the terrorist plans," Muallem charged. "The unlimited Israeli aid to the terrorists does not surprise. They share interests and the goals." While the army and its supporting forces and allies "are making daily achievements, clearing out territories and uprooting terrorists," Muallem said, "the threat of this plague persists." On the political front, he said local reconciliation agreements have allowed tens of thousands of internally displaced people and refugees to return home. He said "Syria is determined to scale up reconciliation efforts, whenever possible." Syrian and Hezbollah forces (Photo: Reuters) Russia, Turkey and Iran have been negotiating separately for months in the Kazakh capital Astana to try to reduce violence on the ground by creating de-escalation zones across the country, although those talks do not cover a long-term political solution to the six-year civil war. Muallem said Syria is encouraged by talks in Astana and expressed hope that these talks "will help us reach an actual cessation of hostilities and separate terrorist groups" like ISIS from groups that have agreed to join the Astana process. Nevertheless, he said: "Syria reserves the right to respond to any violation by the other party. Syria also stresses that these zones are a temporary arrangement that must not violate the territorial unity of Syria." Earlier this month Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed to deploy observers on the edge of a "de-escalation" zone in Syria's Idlib province, which is largely under the control of Islamist insurgents. The move falls under a broader deal in which they would set up four such zones across Syria. The de-escalation plan has eased fighting in parts of western Syria between rebel factions and government forces loyal to Assad. Assad has gained the military upper hand against an array of rebel groups, including some that have received backing from the United States, Turkey and Gulf monarchies. Critics have described the de-escalation plan as de facto partitioning of Syria after years of multi-sided conflict. Moscow, Tehran and Ankara deny this and say the zones will be temporary, although they could extend beyond the initial six-month term. Muallem reaffirmed the Syrian government's commitment to further progress in Geneva talks, which are aimed at establishing a transitional government, drafting a new constitution and holding elections in Syria. "This process has yet to bear fruit in the absence of a genuine national opposition that can be a partner in Syria's future," he said, "and as countries with influence over the other party continue to block any meaningful progress." Talks among Syrian opposition groups are expected to take place in early October in hopes of producing a unified delegation in Geneva.

Israel accuses world powers of yielding to Iran for nuclear deal By Dan Williams JERUSALEM, June 14 (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused world powers on Sunday of stepping up concessions to Iran to enable a deal by June 30 on curbing its nuclear programme even as Tehran balks at demands for heightened U.N. inspections. Netanyahu has argued that the agreement in the works would not deny Iran - which says its nuclear projects are peaceful - the means of making a bomb, while granting it sanctions relief that could help bankroll its guerrilla allies in the region. "To our regret, the reports that are coming in from the world powers attest to an acceleration of concessions by them in the face of Iranian stubbornness," Netanyahu told his cabinet in broadcast remarks on Sunday. He did not offer further details. Netanyahu's point-man on the Iranian talks, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, said it appeared that world powers were prepared to accommodate Tehran's resistance to expanded, short-order U.N. nuclear inspections and demand to continue research and development of uranium centrifuges that make nuclear fuel. On Saturday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said his country, in the name of protecting state secrets, could reject stepped-up inspections - even at the cost of missing the June 30 deadline. Western diplomats had sought the right to carry out inspections with as little as two hours' notice. But in a televised address on Sunday, Rouhani played up the benefits of easing Iran's international isolation and pledged to reach a deal that would end the hardship of sanctions. U.S.-ISRAELI CONTACTS Steinitz, who was in Washington last week to discuss the Iran diplomacy, said the world powers -- the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany -- were considering a stop-gap whereby inspections would be decided on "by committee". "Such an arrangement might offer reassurance on paper, but in reality it would give Iran time to cover up illegal nuclear activity or even relocate it off-site," Steinitz told Reuters. He added that Israel saw no reason for world powers to allow Iran to continue research and development on uranium centrifuges "if this deal is indeed meant to freeze its programme for years". On a visit to Israel last week, America's top general sought to reassure Israel -- widely assumed to have the Middle East's only atomic arsenal -- of "unshakable" U.S. military support. General Martin Dempsey said long-term prospects were "far better" with an Iran that was not a nuclear weapons power and that Washington would work to mitigate Iran-related risks, with or without a deal. Netanyahu urged world powers to hold off on a final accord. "From the outset, the agreement being put together looked bad. It looks worse and worse with each passing day," he said in his cabinet remarks. Asked to rate the chances of world powers deferring the deadline to renegotiate the deal, Steinitz said: "Fifty-fifty."

Skip to comments. US rebuffs Israel’s last-ditch bid for nuclear constraints in Iran accord DEBKAfile ^ | June 21, 2015, 7:52 PM (IDT) Posted on by Dave346 Israels National Security Adviser Yossi Cohen was invited to join two top US officials for dinner in Washington on June 15 to try and make Israels case for amending the disastrous nuclear accord taking shape in Vienna between the six world powers and Iran, before it was too late. This meeting is reported here by debkafile for the first time. It was hosted by US National Security Adviser Susan Rice and senior US nuclear negotiator Undersecretary of State Wendy Sherman. The occasion was arranged by CIA Director John Brennan at the end of his visit to Jerusalem in the first week of June. He had come to offer senior Israelis, led by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, a behind-the-scenes briefing on the provisions the Obama administration had accepted for the final nuclear accord with Iran due to be signed by June 30. This briefing was greeted in Jerusalem with shock and alarm. Very few of the conditions for a deal stipulated by the US upon embarking on the negotiations had survived: Iran would continue to enrich uranium, be allowed to bar international inspections of military facilities suspected of hosting nuclear research activity (where were Obama's "intrusive inspections?) and - Israeli officials heard this for the first time - the Iranian UCF facility at Isfahan would be expanded. This plant is engaged in the conversion of yellow cake to enriched nuclear material. They also discovered that President Obama, who had originally promised the deal would provide for snapping sanctions back in the event of violations, had assured Tehran that once sanctions were lifted, they would not be re-imposed. Netanyahu asked Brennan for time to digest the full extent of the Obama administrations retreat in the face of Irans nuclear aspirations. He then asked for his national security adviser to be given a chance to propose changes that would allay some of Israels concerns. Brennan quickly set up a date for Cohen to be received in Washington. debkafiles Washington sources reveal that at the dinner in Washington, the Israeli official tried a new tack with his hostesses, Rice and Sherman. On the understanding that the main clauses of the nuclear accord had been finalized and gone past the stage of amendment, he nonetheless suggested a number of insertions in the various clauses that would make it a better deal for American as well as Israeli security. Rice and Sherman politely allowed him to finish talking and then turned his proposals down flat. US and Israeli official sources agree that the invitation to Cohen had not been intended for any serious discussion between the two governments on the Iranian nuclear issue. The two top American officials dealing with the nuclear question barely heard a word that Cohen said. His journey to Washington was a complete waste of time. TOPICS: Foreign Affairs Israel War on Terror KEYWORDS: bomb eritrea hizbollah iran israel lebanon nuclear terror war waronterror yemen To: Dave346 Don’t know why this should be exclusively an Israeli concern; Iran’s nukes will be brought to American cities, too, even if the Iranians have to bring them in row boats and carry them on camels.

News article:
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu warned the West yet again about the looming nuclear deal with Iran on Monday, lamenting the "potholes" in talks and their consequences. "I am not impressed by the potholes in the nuclear talks," he began. "To my regret, what we are seeing are Iran's increasing demands, and the major powers' concessions which are also increasing, in keeping with the Iranian pressure." "This agreement is going from a bad agreement to a worse agreement, and is becoming worse by the day," he continued. "In effect, it is paving Iran's way to being not only a major power with one or two nuclear bombs, but with an unlimited arsenal within a decade with the possibility of achieving several atomic bombs beforehand, by violating the monitoring which, in any case, is full of holes." "Above all, in addition to this, the agreement also gives Iran many billions of dollars, apparently hundreds of billions of dollars, within a short time, which will allow it to finance its increasing aggression, first of all the murderous stranglehold it is using around the State of Israel, but also in other parts of the Middle East that are subject to its aggression, such as Yemen, Iraq and many other places," he added. Netanyahu predicted a dire future for the global community if such a deal is signed. "Therefore, there is both a conventional threat and a non-conventional threat, which in my view will heighten the nuclear arms race in the Middle East," he said. "For all of these reasons, this is a bad agreement. I appreciate the fact that there is a broad consensus within the State of Israel against this agreement." "There are also increasing voices in the West against this agreement; they understand the significance its implementation would have on global security, theirs as well," he concluded. "But, as has been said, this debate is still taking place." "I think it is important that Israel's voice be heard, along with that of many others." The deadline for the Iranian nuclear deal is Tuesday.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday reiterated his opposition to the international deal on Iran’s nuclear program, saying the agreement would allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons. “We believe that it is a fundamental mistake to enable such a terrorist regime to get to nuclear weapons, which is what the proposed agreement will give them,” Netanyahu said ahead of a meeting in Jerusalem with Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni. “It will give them a definite pathway to nuclear bombs -– not a bomb, but nuclear bombs.” The prime minister has consistently slammed the proposed deal with Iran and has not ruled out the use of military force to keep it from acquiring atomic weapons. Iran denies its nuclear program has a military bent. Netanyahu said that lifting sanctions against Iran would allow the Iranians to “replenish their coffers with many billions — actually perhaps up to hundreds of billions — of dollars to enable them to continue their terrorism and aggression.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “This is something that is wrong,” Netanyahu said of the agreement. “It is dangerous. It is dangerous for Israel, for Italy, for Europe, for the United States, for the world.” He referred to Iran as the “Islamic State of Iran,” and called it the world’s “greatest sponsor of terrorism.” “The world is properly concerned and aghast at the violence and savagery of ISIS,” the prime minister said. “No one would dream of allowing the Islamic State of ISIS to have nuclear weapons. Why would anyone consider giving the Islamic State of Iran, which is a lot more powerful than ISIS and acts with much greater power than ISIS to have additional power of nuclear weapons?” Advertisement The deadline of midnight for an accord ending a 13-year standoff over Iran’s nuclear ambitions was widely expected to be extended, but only for a few more days. Iran has been negotiating with the so-called P5+1 powers — the United States, Britain, China, France, Russia and Germany. Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.

News article:
WASHINGTON -- Iran is like the Islamic State, only bigger and more powerful, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “No one would dream of allowing the Islamic State of ISIS to have nuclear weapons,” Netanyahu said Tuesday, using another name for the militant organization. “Why would anyone consider giving the Islamic State of Iran, which is a lot more powerful than ISIS and acts with much greater power than ISIS, to have additional power of nuclear weapons?” Advertisement Shortly after Netanyahu’s remarks, a Twitter account associated with the prime minister shared a cartoon video imagining how dangerous the Islamic State would be if it were building atomic bombs. “Well, maybe it’s not that hard to imagine,” the video’s narrator says. “The Islamic State of Iran. Like ISIS, just much bigger.” WATCH AND RETWEET: The Islamic State of Iran - like ISIS. Just much bigger.https://t.co/1b3YCsEyxy — PM of Israel (@IsraeliPM) June 30, 2015 Netanyahu’s comments come as Iran, the U.S. and five other nations are in the final stages of hammering out a nuclear agreement under which Iran would significantly curtail its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Negotiators extended their self-imposed deadline of Tuesday another week, until July 7. If they fail to reach an agreement by July 9, the time that the U.S. Congress has allotted itself to review the deal will double from 30 days to 60 days, further delaying implementation of the deal. Netanyahu argues that any sanctions relief provided to Iran as part of a nuclear agreement will lead to Iran’s further support of Syrian President Bashar Assad and terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. The Israeli prime minister has repeatedly invoked the Islamic State comparison in his efforts to persuade President Barack Obama to walk away from the nuclear talks, ramp up sanctions and demand further concessions from Iran. Advertisement “To defeat ISIS and leave Iran as a threshold nuclear power is to win the battle and lose the war,” Netanyahu warned in his address last September to the United Nations General Assembly. This past March, one month before a critical benchmark in the nuclear talks, Netanyahu traveled to Washington to speak to Congress in a similar vein. "Iran and [the Islamic State] are competing for the crown of militant Islam. One calls itself the Islamic Republic. The other calls itself the Islamic State," he told lawmakers during his highly controversial speech. "Both want to impose a militant Islamic empire first on the region and then on the entire world. They just disagree among themselves who will be the ruler of that empire."

News article:
The prospective nuclear deal with Iran would empower it to take over the Middle East and trigger a regional nuclear arms race, a senior Israeli official warned in an interview published Friday. Ram Ben Barak, director general of the Strategic Affairs Ministry and a leading candidate to be the next head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency, told the Makor Rishon newspaper that “the deal which is about to be signed will allow Iran to decide by itself when it will be nuclear [armed], and that is the most problematic.” He said the lifting of sanctions would give Tehran “an ocean of money,” allowing it to buy influence across the Middle East and “advance to a position where no one will be able to threaten it and it will acquire control wherever it pleases.” Ben Barak noted that there is “almost no area in the Middle East today where Iran remains uninvolved: Iraq, where Iranian interests are in line with US interests, Lebanon, where Hezbollah is effectively an Iranian division, and Yemen, which was mostly conquered by Iran.” “Think what happens if in coming years Iran will receive billions of dollars. They will have no limitations,” he said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Ben Barak is one of three candidates vying for the coveted position of Mossad chief, contending with current National Security Council chair Yossi Cohen and an unnamed deputy to current Mossad chief Tamir Pardo. Pardo is slated to step down in January 2016. Ben Barak has only been directing the Strategic Affairs Ministry since December 2014. He began working with the Mossad in 1991 and rose through the ranks before taking on his current post. As director general of the ministry, Ben Barak defined his role as “being the eyes and ears of the prime minister.” Advertisement The Iran dossier, he said, “is one of the most important things we deal with. The Iranian issue has great influence, beyond the fact that a nuclear Iran is not something, in Israel’s view, which can be tolerated.” Like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Ben Barak believes that “if the Americans would insist and press more, a much better agreement could be achieved. There is no doubt a good deal is preferable to war. Everyone understands this, from the prime minister to the last citizen on the street. But a bad deal can have really serious implications.” Ben Barak said he shared the view that countries such as Egypt or Saudi Arabia were almost certain to enter a nuclear arms race to counterbalance Iran’s nuclear aspirations. “Almost certainly, this process will occur. The Saudis and Gulf states are concerned by an Iranian takeover of the region no less than we are. There are, at the end of the day, many natural resources there, and we have already seen in the past an Iraqi attempt to take over Kuwait because of its oil reserves,” he said, referring to the First Gulf War. The Iranian nuclear race, he said, is compounded by the grander Sunni-Shiite war in the Middle East. “Money is not lacking in the Gulf States, they can buy anything. As soon as they see the Iranians enter a corridor which ends with nuclear capability, they will enter this corridor too, and the entire region will be in an arms race.” All Gulf states apart from Iran have a majority of Sunni Arabs, whereas Iran is overwhelmingly Shiite and non-Arab Persian. Advertisement Ben Barak said he preferred “not to go into details” of the opportunities the geostrategic situation offers Israel in terms of alliances with moderate Sunni states. “You can see the common interest with Egypt, and I assume there are other” shared interests with other Sunni states. Sunni states, he said, were “fighting a double fight. On the one hand there is the Shiite axis headed by Iran… and on the other side they have Sunni radicals, who see their nation-states as heretical.” Ben Barak said Iran’s proxy, the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, may lose its war in Syria against the Islamic State, one instance where the Sunni-Shiite conflict rages closer to Israel. “There are Shiite militias there brought by the Iranians, and many Hezbollah fighters, but they do not succeed in holding back the rebels.” “The Shiites are no more concerned with radical [Sunni] Islam than with the Jews. In four or five years, there may be a new reality in southern Lebanon. In the Golan Heights it is already happening. The Syrian Army there is non-existent. Tomorrow we could have terror attacks on the [Golan Heights’] border fence,” he added. Asked whether the West and the international community could affect the Syrian civil war, Ben Barak responded negatively: “This conflict is stronger than the influence of the [world] powers. It’s a Sunni-Shiite conflict, the Russians and the Americans do not function in it. They have some leverage with [Syrian President Bashar] Assad, but he is only one player among many. The Islamic State and [al-Qaeda affiliated] Nusra Front don’t care about the powers-that-be.” Ben Barak also said an analysis which considers Israel to be at an advantage because its enemies are battling another is “an immature view.” “Wars end and then there is a new reality. Hezbollah without Syria will be crippled, because then it will have trouble getting Iranian assistance and this is important for us, but it’s not clear that the alternative will be better. During the Iran-Iraq War they also said it’s the best outcome for the Jews, and look where we are today. The war in Syria will stabilize, and then the common enemy will again be us. We need to prepare for this.”

News article:
Diplomatic sources in Israel said Sunday that the forthcoming deal between world powers and Iran is much worse than the initial framework agreement signed fourth months ago in Lausanne, and claim that since then there have been even more concessions. Under the assumption that a deal will be signed, Jerusalem is preparing for its next battle: preventing congressional approval for the deal. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Secretary of State John Kerry held a press conference in Vienna Saturday, in which he stated that he agrees with Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif's sentiment that a deal has "never been closer". Kerry said that "the right choices" could lead to a deal being signed this week. Mohammed Zarif (Photo: AP) Kerry went on to mention, however, that gaps still remained with Iran on major issues. Officials in Israel were unfazed by reports of disagreements in the Vienna talks, suggesting the aleged issues where purposely leaked in preparation signing a final accord. According to information obtained by officials in Jerusalem, the powers have agreed to further concessions on the number of centrifuges, as well as centrifuge research and development. Additionally, the western powers havve apparently made concessions on the issue of sanctions relief. John Kerry at the talks (Photo:AP) Israeli officials were still pushing for last-minute amendments to the deal, even if chances of implementing them remained slim. Energy and Infrastructure Minister Yuval Steinitz had spoken with representatives of Germany, France, and the UK in recent days, calling their attention to weak points in the deal. In anticipation of a final deal, officials in Jerusalem are preparing to exert pressure on the US Congress to prevent it from signing off. If a deal is submitted to Congress before July 9, the vote would be held within 30 days due to the upcoming congressional recess. On the other hand, if the deal were to be submitted after July 9, the vote would only take place after 60 days. If a majority votes against the Iran deal in Congress, President Obama can veto the move. If the president does use his veto, however, it would allow him to decide when to return the motion for a revote in Congress -- in which case a two-thirds majority in both houses would be needed to bypass the presidential veto. Israel's goal: Bypassing the veto Israel is pressuring Congress members to scuttle the deal in the first vote. If the deal goes to the floor, Israel will make a concerted diplomatic effort to achieve a two-thirds majority in order to bypass a possible veto. Officials in Jerusalem estimate that Obama will have enough support to approve the measure in the first vote, thanks to fear among members of Congress that denying the measure while other powers begin trading with Iran will come at a great economic cost to US industry. There are, however, officials in Israel who believe the battle is not over yet, and that with the right work a majority can be achieved against the measure in the first vote. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (Photo:AFP) Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself is already preparing to battle for the hearts and minds of Congress members, and opened this week's government meeting with fierce criticism of the possible deal. "The deal being formed in Vienna is not a breakthrough, it’s a breakdown," Netanyahu said. He warned that it "would pave the way for Iran to produce multiple nuclear weapons, and will bring it hundreds of billions of dollars, which Iran will use to further aggression and terrorist exploits, both in the region and around the world. "It’s a bad deal. It's not any better, and is even worse, than the deal made with North Korea, which led to a nuclear arsenal in North Korea. But here we are talking about both an unconventional and large conventional threat to Israel, the region's states, and the world as a whole." Meanwhile, diplomatic officials within Israel have leveled heavy criticsm against Netanyahu, protesting the fact that he has not resumed talks with the US government on the size of Israel's security aid package in the wake of a deal with Iran. The same officials said that unlike Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf nations understood that a deal with Iran is a pre-determined fact and are already deep in negotiations with the Americans on the size of the conciliatory defense aid package they will receive. These officials said that Israel should have entered into defense aid package talks with Washington before the deal, because then Obama would have been more generous than an agreement is signed, especially if Israel is going to campaign against the deal in Congress.

WASHINGTON (JTA) — Keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons power is the “paramount challenge” of this generation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a pro-Israel conference. Netanyahu kept his remarks brief on Monday in a live video feed to the annual conference of Christians United for Israel in Washington, D.C. But speaking to his parliament on the same day, the Israeli leader signaled that he was ready to mount an effort to derail the deal that major powers and Iran appear ready to finalize in talks in Vienna. “It seems that there are those who are ready to make an agreement at any price – and this bad agreement is unavoidable,” Netanyahu told the Knesset. “Our commitment is to prevent Iran from arming itself with nuclear weapons, and it is valid today more than ever. I call on all those who care about Israel’s security to unite behind this commitment.” Netanyahu was setting up a task force to lobby against implementation of the deal, The Jerusalem Post reported, with a particular focus on the U.S. Congress, which under U.S. law may disapprove of the deal. Also, he set up for the first time a Persian language Twitter account as a means of explaining his opposition to a deal to Iranian citizens. The CUFI conference featured speaker after speaker condemning the deal as appeasement, including an array of Republican presidential hopefuls, among them former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. “This deal will legitimize Iran and will destabilize the Middle East,” Bush said.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday evening said it was “absurd” to suggest that his relationship with US President Barack Obama had any bearing on the nuclear deal. In his third statement to the press in a single day, the prime minister said that without Israel’s efforts to thwart Iran’s nuclear ambitions, Tehran would have already broken out to the bomb. Israel will continue to work to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, he vowed. Netanyahu made a brief statement after exiting a security cabinet meeting, during which the ministers voted unanimously to reject the Iran deal “and determined that Israel is not bound by it,” according to a press release. “The claim by political sources that my personal relationship with Obama had an effect on the nuclear deal is absurd,” he said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Several opposition Knesset members, including Zionist Union party leader Isaac Herzog and Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid, had charged that Netanyahu’s strained ties with the US president compromised Israel’s negotiating position. The US administration was set on “normalizing ties with Iran” even “before I entered my position,” Netanyahu said. “Afterwards, the US opened secret negotiations with Iran that were later made public. Obviously, the desire to reach a deal led to this outcome.” Netanyahu hailed Israeli efforts to thwart Iran’s nuclear efforts, while maintaining that he had spared no effort during the past 20 years to stop Tehran. Advertisement “On the other hand, in the past two decades, even when I wasn’t prime minister and later when I was elected, I did everything, everything in my power, everything in the power of Israel, to prevent Iran from arming itself with a nuclear weapons,” Netanyahu said. “The pressure we applied and the operations we carried out for years have stopped Iran from arming itself with nuclear weapons. I can say that without Israel’s actions, Iran would have long received nuclear arms.” The prime minister urged a united political front in Israel to combat the nuclear deal. “We have one goal — to ensure that it won’t arm itself in the future,” he added. “And at this time, facing this task, we cannot occupy ourselves with petty politics and false accusations.” Earlier Tuesday, Netanyahu spoke on the phone with Obama, expressing Israel’s concerns over the Iranian nuclear deal and maintaining that the Islamic Republic would obtain nuclear weapons with or without the agreement. “The prime minister emphasized that the deal raises two main dangers: It will allow Iran to arm itself with nuclear weapons — if it keeps to the deal, at the end of the 10-15 years, if it breaks it, before then,” a statement from Netanyahu’s office said. Advertisement “It addition, it will pump hundreds of billions of dollars into the Iranian terror and war machine which threatens Israel and the entire world,” the statement quoted Netanyahu as telling Obama. Obama told the skeptical prime minister that the freshly sealed Iran nuclear deal was in Israel’s “national security interest” and dispatched his secretary of defense to the Jewish state for talks. The White House said Ashton Carter would travel to Israel next week. “The president told the prime minister that today’s agreement on the nuclear issue will not diminish our concerns regarding Iran’s support for terrorism and threats toward Israel,” the White House said. On Tuesday afternoon, Netanyahu slammed the world powers’ nuclear deal with Iran as a “stunning historic mistake,” while maintaining that Israel was under no obligation to adhere to it. “Israel is not bound by this deal with Iran because Iran continues to seek our destruction. We will always defend ourselves,” Netanyahu told foreign media reporters in Jerusalem. The prime minister lashed out at world powers for easing sanctions against the Islamic Republic without requiring it to cease support for militant movements in the region, and for not requiring Tehran to dismantle its facilities as part of the agreement. “By not dismantling Iran’s nuclear program, in a decade this deal will give an unreformed, unrepentant and far richer terrorism regime the capacity to produce many nuclear bombs; in fact an entire nuclear arsenal, with the means to deliver it,” he said. “What a stunning historic mistake.”

2009: Iran will become “a messianic apocalyptic cult controlling atomic bombs” The Israeli Prime Minister claimed that the Iranian regime consists of dangerous fanatics and warned against the nuclear armament of these ‘extreme forces.’ 2010: “Iran is, at most, one to three years away from having a breakout nuclear capability” Israel’s appeals to stop Iranian ‘destructive’ activities intensified, raising speculations about a possible military strike against the Islamic Republic. 2011: “The main problem in the Middle East is this tyrannical medieval regime, terrorist regime of Iran” Netanyahu demanded an increase in international pressure on Iran and harsher sanctions. He also blamed the international community for focusing on the Palestine issue and said that the main security challenge in the Middle East is Iran’s “fanatic ideology armed with nuclear weapons”. 2012: Iran is 90 percent of the way to building a bomb and will soon cross the “red line” During his address to the UN General Assembly, mostly known as his “red-line speech”, Netanyahu was holding a cartoon-like picture of a bomb. He drew a red line on the picture signifying the final stage of bomb development and called on the international community to immediately take military action against Iran. 2013: “Iran is building intercontinental ballistic missiles to reach the American mainland in a few years” This statement was made by the Israeli Prime Minister during his interview with CBS. The mentioned ‘threat’ was considered a complete exaggeration by an overwhelming majority of experts and labelled as another part of excessive Israeli propaganda. 2014: Iran is “publically calling for the annihilation” of Israel Netanyahu called the Iranian regime “unrepentant” and “unreformed,” arguing that Iran’s main goal is Israel's eradication. 2015: An agreement with Iran is a "mistake of historic proportions" Netanyahu called the latest nuclear deal between Iran and the P5+1 a mistake of historic proportions. He also stated that Israel is not bound by this agreement and will defend itself in case of Iranian aggression.

News article:
Israeli lawmakers voiced strong opposition to a landmark nuclear deal reached between Iran and world powers Tuesday morning, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning the agreement was “a historic mistake.” Criticism of the deal came from both sides of Israel’s political spectrum as the pact, long feared in Israel as paving Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon, was clinched by the sides after years of talks. “From the initial reports we can already conclude that this agreement is an historic mistake for the world,” Netanyahu said at the start of a meeting with Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders. “Far-reaching concessions have been made in all areas that were supposed to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons capability.” Echoing comments he made a day earlier, Netanyahu said the agreement was inevitable when the US was willing to cave to Iranian demands even as Tehran officials led public calls of “Death to America.” “I would like to say here and now – when you are willing to make an agreement at any cost, this is the result.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Netanyahu, who has lobbied incessantly against the emerging agreement, said he never opposed the deal, but rather Iran’s ability to obtain a nuclear weapon. “We knew very well that the desire to sign an agreement was stronger than anything, and therefore we did not commit to preventing an agreement. We did commit to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and this commitment still stands,” he said. Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely slammed the deal as a “historic agreement of surrender by the West to the axis of evil led by Iran.” Advertisement “The implications of the agreement in the foreseeable future are very bad. Iran will continue sending terror cells in all directions, will continue to inflame the Middle East and worst of all – will take a huge step toward becoming a nuclear threshold state,” Hotovely said. She said that Israel would use any diplomatic means necessary to prevent the confirmation of the agreement by the US Congress. According to diplomats, the deal, which seeks to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions in exchange for sanctions relief, will place limits on the amount of nuclear work Iran can do over the next 10 to 15 years in exchange for the easing of economic sanctions. It will still need to be ratified by Congress in Washington, and Israeli officials have indicated they will continue to fight for a stronger deal. Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan told Army Radio the “details of the agreement matter little, so long as they [the Iranians] can ultimately acquire nuclear weapons.” Erdan expressed hope that Congress would listen to Israel’s concerns and carefully scrutinize the agreement in the allotted 60 review period. Advertisement Netanyahu called on all Israeli leaders to set aside political differences and unite behind what he called the most fateful issue for Israel’s future and security. Most opposition politicians, though slammed the prime minister’s handling of the US-led diplomatic initiative. Speaking to Israel Radio, Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog said that had Netanyahu not feuded with the Obama administration, Israel would be receiving a military assistance package as “compensation” for the deal. “If you go to a deal, as bad as it may be, the way to minimize its damage is by arriving at an agreement with the US on a very significant security package,” Herzog said, pointing to similar agreements negotiated by the US-aligned Sunni Gulf states. “Israel is avoiding doing this and is not negotiating with the US.” Zionist Union co-chair Tzipi Livni lamented the fact that Israel had no influence on the terms of the deal. It is “a dramatic agreement, and Israel is not there,” she said. “If anything is clear it is that Netanyahu is ineffective,” she said. While criticizing the deal, opposition politicians seemed to rule out working with the coalition to thwart it. “The Labor Party must not be a partner to the attempts to circumvent the US administration by way of Congress. It has become undoubtedly clear that the bitter confrontation with the Americans was an utter failure that will be taught in history books,” said Zionist Union MK Shelly Yachimovich, a member of the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Advertisement Former foreign minister and Yisrael Beytenu MK Avigdor Liberman, also in the opposition, likened the deal to the infamous 1938 agreement that appeased Nazi Germany and the US’s nuclear disarmament agreement with North Korea. The deal to be announced in Vienna Tuesday is a “complete capitulation to terrorism,” he said. “A black flag waves over this agreement and it will be remembered as a black day for the free world,” Liberman added. Calling the deal a danger for the entire free world, Technology Minister Danny Danon said the money the agreement will bring Iran will “fuel terrorism in the streets of Jerusalem, Washington and London.” The Likud lawmaker called on Israel’s allies to reject the agreement. Likud Minister of Tourism Yariv Levin lambasted what he called “a very bad agreement, setting a path that in ten years will allow Iran to have a large arsenal of nuclear weapons with the approval and consent of world powers.” Levin said the agreement would enable Tehran to continue its support of terrorism across the region. Likud Minister Miri Regev said the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers gives the Islamic Republic a “license to kill.” Regev called the deal “bad for the free world (and) bad for humanity,” and said lobbying against the deal reached in Vienna should continue.

News article:
Israel Rejects, UN Hails Nuclear Deal by VOA News July 14, 2015 The news that major world powers and Iran reached a historic deal aimed at ensuring that Iran does not obtain the nuclear bomb was met with condemnation by Israel but hailed by the United Nations and Tehran's regional neighbors. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Tuesday's nuclear deal with Iran 'stunning historic mistake.' Netanyahu, speaking in English to reporters in Jerusalem said his country is not bound by the international nuclear pact with Iran and that Israel reserves the right to defend itself. 'Israel is not bound by this deal with Iran, and Israel is not bound by this deal with Iran because Iran continues to seek our destruction,' Netanyahu told reporters. Israel's first course of action looks to be an intense lobbying effort in the U.S. Congress to oppose the deal. 'Historic agreement' United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon congratulated negotiators in Vienna on finalizing an agreement in a statement Tuesday. 'I warmly welcome the historic agreement in Vienna today and congratulate the P5+1 and Iran for reaching this agreement. This is testament to the value of dialogue,' Ban said in the statement. 'I hope – and indeed believe – that this agreement will lead to greater mutual understanding and cooperation on the many serious security challenges in the Middle East. As such it could serve as a vital contribution to peace and stability both in the region and beyond,' the statement said. In Russia, President Vladimir Putin said, with the nuclear agreement, the world can breathe a sigh of relief, and that the negotiating countries made hard choices for stability and cooperation. The European Union hailed it as a new chapter of hope for the world. Regional governments The ruler of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, sent a note of congratulations to Iran's President Hassan Rouhani Tuesday, the UAE's official news agency WAM reported. The statement contained the first official comment by Gulf Arab countries toward a deal many of them privately fear will encourage Iran to back their enemies across the Middle East more forcefully. The Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan governments released statements welcoming the nuclear agreement. The spokesman for Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said the nuclear deal will be 'a catalyst for regional stability.' Saad al-Hadithi said the agreement, designed to avert the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran, is 'an important step' and will lead to better unity in the fight against terrorism. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, in a statement, 'welcomed any efforts that result in expansion of political and economic relations between states as well as consolidation and strengthening of peace and stability in the region.' Pakistan, in a statement, said it 'has consistently maintained that the Iran nuclear issue should be peacefully resolved through dialogue. As a neighboring country, we have also reiterated that reciprocal confidence-building measures relating to Iran's nuclear program auger well for peace and security in our region.' Pakistani defense analyst Talat Masood, a retired Pakistani general, told Islamabad PTV News the agreement 'will bring an extraordinary change. Its positive effects will include improvement in relations between Iran and the Western world, particularly the United States, and gradual lifting of the sanctions imposed on it. 'Moreover ... it is also likely to change the balance of power between Iran and the Arab countries in the Middle East, something Iran has been striving for,' Masood said. In Syria, President Bashar al-Assad, whose government has received military and financial support during from Tehran during its four-year civil war, praised the agreement. Widely criticized in Israel However, reaction was critical across the political spectrum in Israel, where concern is high the country's arch enemy has duped the world and will acquire nuclear weapons to use against Israel. Iran already backs militant groups that attack Israel and its leaders frequently have referred to Israel's destruction in the past. Netanyahu has been at the forefront of global opposition to the deal and has openly clashed with the Obama administration and other Western powers that have been pushing for an easing of sanctions in return for greater restrictions on its nuclear program. Speaking in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said Israel's 'concern is that the militant Islamic state of Iran is going to receive a short path to nuclear weapons. 'Many of the restrictions that were supposed to prevent it from getting there will be lifted. And, in addition, Iran will get a jackpot, a cash bonanza, of hundreds of billions of dollars, which will enable it to continue to pursue its aggression and terror in the region and in the world,' he added. He concluded by saying Israel would continue to have to defend its way of life, freedoms and security. Israel received an official copy of the Iran nuclear agreement Tuesday, according to the Haaretz website. 'Lies and deciet' On Tuesday, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon told The Jerusalem Post that the agreement was built on 'lies and deceit.' Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely said Israel 'will employ all diplomatic means to prevent confirmation of the agreement.' Netanyahu's coalition partners angrily criticized Tuesday's agreement. Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who heads the hawkish Jewish Home party, said July 14 will be remembered a 'dark day for the free world.' Cabinet Minister Miri Regev said the agreement gave Iran a 'license to kill.' The cascade of criticism crossed party lines, reflecting the widespread opposition to the deal in Israel. 'This is a regime based in deceit, and now they are going to do what they did for the last 20 years, which is trying to get themselves nuclear weapons behind the back of the world,' Yair Lapid, the head of the opposition Yesh Atid Party, told The Associated Press. 'Now they are going to do it with the help of the international community.' 'Nuclear route' At Tel Aviv's Institute for National Security Studies, Emily Landau, the head of its arms control and regional security program said Tuesday that 'if there's a sense in the region that the international actors ... have not provided mechanisms for preventing [Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons], then definitely there will be additional motivation in the region to go down the nuclear route.' Noting that acquiring nuclear weapons capability is 'irreversible,' she added that the 'sunset provision' allowing the agreement to expire after some years would allow Iran eventually to pursue legally a nuclear weapons program. Finally, Landau said the accord "does not change the Iranian narrative," which is to expand its status and influence across and beyond the Middle East.

News article:
TEL AVIV (JTA) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decried an agreement over Iran’s nuclear program hundreds of times — most notably in a March speech to a joint session of Congress. Now that the agreement is signed, experts say Netanyahu has one way left to block it: Go to Congress again and persuade it to reject the deal. The agreement finalized Tuesday morning in Vienna will relieve Iran of crippling international sanctions in return for Iran limiting its uranium enrichment, ridding most of its stockpile of enriched uranium and submitting to agreed-upon inspections of its nuclear facilities. The deal stipulates that Iran freeze and store — but not dismantle — much of its nuclear infrastructure, and requires inspectors to request access to some Iranian facilities before entering. Sanctions are set to be lifted once Iran fulfills its commitments to deactivate centrifuges, restructure its nuclear facilities and transfer or dilute its uranium stockpile. Sanctions could be restored within 65 days if a committee of representatives from world powers and Iran determines that Iran has violated the agreement. Portions of the accord will expire between 10 and 25 years from the date the accord is adopted. The United Nations Security Council is expected to endorse the accord in a resolution. Netanyahu has made opposing Iran’s nuclear program the defining issue of his premiership, and has consistently criticized the potential agreement since negotiations began in 2013. On Tuesday, at a meeting with Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders ahead of the accord’s announcement, he called the agreement a “historic mistake for the world.” READ: Spoilers alert: Six guys to watch the day after an Iran deal “Far-reaching concessions have been made in all areas that were supposed to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons capability,” Netanyahu said at a news conference. “In addition, Iran will receive hundreds of billions of dollars with which it can fuel its terror machine and its expansion and aggression throughout the Middle East and across the globe.” The agreement also was criticized by Israeli opposition leaders, and the Israeli public has long been skeptical of a deal. In February, an Israel Democracy Institute poll found that 61 percent of Jewish-Israelis thought President Barack Obama would sign a deal even if the Israeli government said it harms Israel’s security. Yair Lapid, chairman of the opposition centrist Yesh Atid party, said Israel should concentrate its criticism on the provision for inspecting Iran’s nuclear facilities. “We should focus on the inspections regime, which is the Achilles’ heel; it’s the weakest part of the deal,” Lapid said in a statement Monday. “I started discussing the issue during my visit to Washington last month and they’re willing to listen.” The only thing standing in the way of the deal’s implementation now is a vote in Congress. Senators and congressmen will have two months to parse the deal’s details, and will vote to accept or reject it when Congress reconvenes in September. Obama has promised to veto a rejection, and overriding that veto would require a two-thirds majority in both houses. That, analysts say, is what Israel’s government will lobby for. Jonathan Rynhold, a senior research associate at Bar-Ilan University’s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, said Israel will need to build a broad coalition of the deal’s opponents — including former members of the Obama administration — if it is to convince enough lawmakers to reject the deal. “Israel can’t do this on its own, but if there’s a coalition of people who for their own reasons think it’s a bad deal, that could change things,” he said. “You’ve seen criticism by other people who used to be involved in policymaking by Obama.” Republicans have staunchly opposed a deal. But while some Democrats have also voiced skepticism about the agreement, reaching two-thirds would mean convincing a sizable chunk of the party to oppose its president’s signature foreign policy initiative. “The question is how much the Democrats will be willing to debate with the president,” said Ephraim Kam, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies. “The Republicans will be able to debate. They don’t like the president, don’t like the agreement. The Democrats won’t want to come out against the president even if they don’t like the agreement.” Some experts said that Netanyahu’s March speech before Congress damaged the effort to fight the deal by forcing Democratic members of Congress to choose between backing Israel and supporting Obama. But Ephraim Inbar, director of the Begin-Sadat Center, said that the speech may have helped galvanize opposition to the agreement by spelling out the dangers it poses. “I think Obama’s policy gave presence to Netanyahu’s speech,” he said. “They gave it a lot of attention, he got a lot of attention, and his claims sounded sensible in public opinion. Should the effort in Congress fail, some Israeli politicians have declared that there’s only one avenue left to prevent a nuclear Iran: a military strike. Netanyahu has floated the threat of a strike for years, saying that Israel has the right to defend itself by itself. Warnings of a strike built up until the nuclear talks began in 2013. Once America was engaged in negotiations with Iran, talks of an Israeli strike subsided somewhat. But now that America has signed the agreement, Lapid again hinted at the possibility of bombing Iran’s nuclear facilities. READ: Israeli leaders, some Jewish groups condemn final Iran nuclear deal “If it is signed, the world needs to know Israel holds all the options,” Lapid told JTA last week. “We need to understand what all the options are. Israel can’t allow a nuclear Iran.” Experts have assessed that an Israeli strike on Iran would not be able to destroy its nuclear program. And Kam said that Israel would be hard-pressed to launch a strike against the backdrop of a deal supported by the world’s major powers. “I think it’s in the fridge,” he said of plans for a strike. “It’s not an option right now. To go militarily against an agreement that’s initiated by the great powers is a tough move. It’s not impossible, but it’s hard.” But Inbar said a strike has grown more likely, as the deal has left Iran with the capability to enrich uranium, giving it the ability to produce a bomb. If that happens, he said, Israel will have no choice but to strike. “It obligates us to a path of military attack,” he said. “The Americans don’t care about our interests. There’s no choice. We can’t wait.”

We did commit to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and this commitment still stands,” Netanyahu said, calling on Israeli leaders to “put petty politics aside and unite behind this most fateful issue to the future and security of the State of Israel.” Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon called the deal an agreement “built on lies and deceit.” “This agreement is a tragedy for all who aspire for regional stability and fear a nuclear Iran,” Yaalon said. “Instead of fighting terror with all its might, the free world has granted legitimacy to Iran’s hateful, murderous ways.” He added that with the signing of the agreement and the lifting of sanctions, “massive funds will be funneled into the Iranian terror accounts.” The combined Arab-Israeli political party, the Joint Arab list, praised the deal as “the victory of the will of the Iranian people in their struggle against the blockade and sanctions imposed on them.” The statement issued by the party said the prime minister’s “aggressive rhetoric of incitement and hostility against the Iran deal under the pretext of the ‘Iranian threat’ are indicative of his imperialist and colonialist outlook.” World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder in a statement pointed out that Iran has failed in the past to live up to its treaty obligations. “I fear we may have entered into an agreement that revives the Iranian economy but won’t stop this regime from developing nuclear arms in the long term, which would have disastrous consequences for the entire region and the world,” he said, calling the agreement ” just a piece of paper,” and “not a legally binding treaty.” The American Jewish Committee praised the efforts of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and the other government officials that “turned (President Obama’s) vision into a reality.” “It is now incumbent on the United States Congress, pursuant to the provisions of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, to thoroughly review, debate, and, ultimately, vote it up or down,” said AJC Executive Director David Harris, in a statement. “However Congress decides to vote on the nuclear deal,” Harris added, “the need for vigilance regarding Iran will not for a single moment be diminished.” The European Friends of Israel called on European Union officials and the governments of the EU states “to speak out against this dangerous deal, which also represents a direct threat to the EU and the national security of European citizens.” The group called the deal “a clear, unmistakable surrender to Iran by the West, including the EU, which was a key member of the negotiations.” All of the groups expressed concern over repeated calls in Iran, including in recent days, for the annihilation of Israel and “death to America.” The Jewish Voice for Peace applauded the deal, saying in a statement that “a negotiated agreement is the only way to alleviate international concern about Iran’s nuclear program and avert war.”

News article:
Secretary of State John Kerry struck back at critics of the nuclear deal with Iran, saying Israel will be safer as a result and that war was not a viable alternative. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed Tuesday's historic agreement between Iran, the U.S. and five world powers as a "bad mistake of historic proportions" that will give Iran a "sure path to nuclear weapons." In an interview with NBC News, Kerry insisted that was not the case, saying the deal was the best option and had long-lasting implications. "What the critics of this plan never offer... is a realistic alternative," Kerry said. "It's wrong for people to think this doesn't have long-term accountability." Kerry dismissed Netanyahu's vocal opposition to the deal, telling NBC News that the prime minister has been "making comments that are way over the top" without having been fully briefed. "Israel is safer" as a result of Tuesday's accord, Kerry added. "This is under attack by people who really don’t know the terms of the agreement." Many in Israel feel Iran poses an existential threat to their country and believe that Tehran cannot be trusted with any nuclear industry. Relations between the two countries could hardly be frostier. Israel, which is believed to possess the Middle East's only nuclear arsenal, has in the past hinted it was ready to attack Iran. Iran, meanwhile, does not officially recognize Israel, and some Iranian leaders have questioned whether the Holocaust ever happened. Kerry stressed that if Iran fails to meet the requirements of the deal, all options remain on the table. "The United States doesn't lose anything... by giving them the opportunity to prove this is a peaceful program," Kerry said. "What's the alternative ... go to war now?" In a separate interview on Tuesday, Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said the importance of diplomacy was one of the main takeaways from the grueling negotiations. “It shows that in our globalized world diplomacy has a much better chance of achieving results than coercion and pressure,” Zarif told NBC News. “I hope this will be a lesson.” While he said “nothing is impossible” in the world of politics, Zarif said he thought it would be some time before relations between the U.S. and Iran were fully normalized. “What we need to do is use this opportunity to start to bring down the very serious wall of mistrust that has been built between the two countries,” he said, decrying a “huge problem of misperception and misinformation about Iran in the U.S. over the years. “It is high time for people in the United States to start looking at Iran without those tainted glasses."

News article:
Josh Block, CEO and President of The Israel Project, issued the following statement in response to today’s announced nuclear agreement with Iran. The Israel Project publishes The Tower. Today’s announcement of this nuclear agreement with Iran is a realization of the deepest fears and the most dire predictions of skeptics who have, for two years, been warning against exactly this outcome — a bad deal that both enriches this tyrannical regime and fails to strip Iran of nuclear weapons capability. The deal will give Iran billions in cash and sanctions relief to fuel its terror and war machines, shred the hard-won sanctions regime beyond repair, and enable the Iranians to get away with hiding the full extent of their nuclear work, infrastructure, and know-how. It will not have an enforceable inspections regime or a workable way to re-impose pressure on Iran when it cheats. And then, after just over a decade, most of this deal will expire, and Iran will be allowed to have a full-blown nuclear program– a screw’s turn away from a nuclear weapon. It is important to ask: if a 3-month nuclear breakout by Iran is a problem today, why are we giving the Mullah’s in Tehran hundreds of billions of dollars, all so Iran will have a zero break out time, according to President Obama himself, in just over a decade? Iran’s repressive regime needs economic relief far more than we need an agreement by these terms. Prior to this round of talks in September 2013, Iran was six-months from a balance of payments crisis and total economic calamity. Rather than leveraging that pressure to stop Iran and dismantle its program, President Obama relieved it prematurely in order to secure an agreement that will midwife an era of nuclear terror and tyranny, at the expense of freedom, human rights, and American national security. At the beginning of these talks, President Obama promised Congress and the American people that he would secure a good deal or walk away. He couldn’t bring home a good deal and he couldn’t bring himself to walk away. Instead, he walked away from every key position demanding the shuttering or dismantlement of Iran’s military nuclear infrastructure — including their fortified enrichment bunker, buried under a mountain, on a military base, where Iran will be permitted to continue enriching and developing its ability to spin faster and more advanced centrifuges. To believe this is a good deal, you have to trust Iran. The American people, and their lawmakers, rightly, do not. Over the next 60 days, Congress will review this accord, acknowledge that the President has, unfortunately, not lived up to the promises that he made, and instead delivered a deal that will make America, our children, and the world less safe. The American people deserve better. Our negotiators can do better. Congress must insist on it, and reject this bad deal. [Photo: The Israel Project / Flickr ]

News article:
This file picture shows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attending a weekly cabinet meeting at his office in Jerusalem on November 12, 2017 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signalled Monday that Israel would take military action in Syria when it sees fit as it seeks to ensure Iran-backed forces stay away from its territory. Israel has long accused Iran, its main enemy, of taking advantage of Syria's civil war to send its Revolutionary Guard and its Lebanese Shiite ally Hezbollah into southern Syria, close to the border with the Jewish state. It has sought to avoid being dragged into the fighting but has carried out dozens of air strikes to prevent arms deliveries to Hezbollah, which fights alongside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. Israel was reportedly seeking a buffer zone in southern Syria near Israeli territory of some 50 kilometres (30 miles), but an agreement reached last week between the United States, Russia and Jordan fell short of that demand, Israeli media said. "I have made it clear to our friends, first of all in Washington and also to our friends in Moscow, that Israel will act in Syria -- including in southern Syria -- according to our understanding and according to our security needs," Netanyahu told senior members of his Likud party, according to a party statement. "This is what is happening and this is what will continue to happen." The November 8 agreement between Jordan, the United States and Russia seeks to build on a ceasefire already in place in southwestern Syria. On Saturday the Israeli military said it shot down a Syrian drone carrying out a reconnaissance mission over the Golan Heights. "We will not allow the consolidation of a Shiite axis in Syria" as a base for operations against Israel, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said in a statement after the incident. - 'Shoulder to shoulder' - Speaking later Monday in parliament, Netanyahu said some of Israel's Arab neighbours shared its concerns. "We stand shoulder to shoulder with countries of the moderate camp in the Arab world, in the face of radical Islam, no matter where it comes from, be it Iran, the Islamic State group or elsewhere," he said, without naming the countries. "I think that this growing closeness and consultation is first and foremost good for security and ultimately for peace," he added. Sunni Muslim powerhouse Saudi Arabia has long been at loggerheads with Shiite, non-Arab Iran but friction has been growing lately as Tehran has backed Shiite Huthi rebels in Yemen. Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman accused Iran of "direct military aggression" against the kingdom by supplying the rebels with ballistic missiles. The kingdom says one was fired toward Riyadh from Yemen on November 4 but brought down by its air defences. Iran denied any involvement. "Iran knows very well, and everyone else should be aware, that we shall not agree to nor accept its military deployment in Syria," Netanyahu told parliament. In September, Israel's military shot down what it said was an Iranian-made drone operated by arch-foe Hezbollah on a similar mission. Israel seized 1,200 square kilometres (460 square miles) of the Golan Heights from Syria in the Six-Day War of 1967 and later annexed it in a move never recognised by the international community.

Pakistan's ties with China will not be at the expense of the 70 years of robust relations with the United States.This was the crux of Pakistan’s Ambassador to the United States Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry speech on Pakistan’s perspective on the changes taking place in South Asia and the prospects for peace and stability in the region. He was speaking in Washington DC on Wednesday at an event hosted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.He said that when Pakistan and the United States worked together they have always succeeded while when they have not they almost certainly failed.He reiterated that the civil-military leadership of Pakistan is united in the fight against terrorism and will not allow any militant safe havens in the country.The Pakistani ambassador doubled down on the need to ensure lasting peace in Afghanistan as it is in the best interests of both countries.He said that instability in the neighbouring country becomes a catalyst for terrorist attacks in Pakistan with porous borders.Chaudhry said that the United States and Pakistan have the same goal in war-torn Afghanistan.The United States has spent more than 680 billion dollars to sustain efforts in the country.He said that both countries worked together to take into custody 600 al Qaeda operatives in the past.Chaudhry said that a comprehensive approach is needed to fight terrorism, not only counterterrorism efforts.He said that 125 acts of terrorism in Pakistan have been perpetrated by militants from Afghanistan.Speaking on the situation in South Asia, he said the situation is uncertain with India and China having an uneasy peace while tensions between India and Pakistan are on the rise.He said that Afghanistan has also become increasingly destabilised. Chaudhry said that there are major question marks over the Iran nuclear deal which was painstakingly achieved after ten years.Coming to Pakistan, he contextualised the major talking points into four issues which included the fight against terrorism, economic situation, youth bulge and continuity of democracy.he Pakistani ambassador said that since 2009 the state apparatus has used all of its resources to rid the country from the scourge of terrorism.He said that the militants have a simple but powerful narrative that it is their holy duty to fight the infidels, however, there is nothing holy about shedding blood of innocents."It is imperative to address the mindset of these militants," he added."After the Army Public School attack in which 137 innocent children belonging to military families who were fighting in tribal areas were targeted by terrorists as revenge their narrative was exposed at a huge cost," he said."After this, even the far right of the political fringes of Pakistan agreed that these militants were barbarians," he said.The military moved into North Waziristan to root out the terroristsHe said that many of these terrorists went to Afghanistan where they can easily operate while others went into the urban areas.Hence, we launched Operation Radd-Ul-Fassad to root them out.Consequently, we lost 6,000 soldiers, as well as, 23,000 civilians in the process.Secondly, with a drop in terrorist acts in the country and an improved law and order situation, the economic situation has picked up. The biggest source of investment is China with the CPEC project. Corporate America has also been rushing to invest in Pakistan after the project was rolled out."We have now reached the zero load shedding mark which is a big achievement for us," he added.He said that there has also been a rise in infrastructure investment with the construction of roads and highways in Balochistan with 1,100 kilometres of roads built."The youth bulge is also a big asset for our country with 207 million young people with about 58 per cent below the age of 30," he further added."This is a big asset for us if we can ensure that they are skilled," he claimed.He underscored the need to guarantee that the democratic process is uninterrupted for 11 years now.He highlighted the need to inculcate transparency and good governance in the process.[/fbvideo]

He was speaking in Washington DC on Wednesday at an event hosted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.He said that when Pakistan and the United States worked together they have always succeeded while when they have not they almost certainly failed.He reiterated that the civil-military leadership of Pakistan is united in the fight against terrorism and will not allow any militant safe havens in the country.The Pakistani ambassador doubled down on the need to ensure lasting peace in Afghanistan as it is in the best interests of both countries.He said that instability in the neighbouring country becomes a catalyst for terrorist attacks in Pakistan with porous borders.Chaudhry said that the United States and Pakistan have the same goal in war-torn Afghanistan.The United States has spent more than 680 billion dollars to sustain efforts in the country.He said that both countries worked together to take into custody 600 al Qaeda operatives in the past.Chaudhry said that a comprehensive approach is needed to fight terrorism, not only counterterrorism efforts.He said that 125 acts of terrorism in Pakistan have been perpetrated by militants from Afghanistan.Speaking on the situation in South Asia, he said the situation is uncertain with India and China having an uneasy peace while tensions between India and Pakistan are on the rise.He said that Afghanistan has also become increasingly destabilised. Chaudhry said that there are major question marks over the Iran nuclear deal which was painstakingly achieved after ten years.Coming to Pakistan, he contextualised the major talking points into four issues which included the fight against terrorism, economic situation, youth bulge and continuity of democracy.he Pakistani ambassador said that since 2009 the state apparatus has used all of its resources to rid the country from the scourge of terrorism.He said that the militants have a simple but powerful narrative that it is their holy duty to fight the infidels, however, there is nothing holy about shedding blood of innocents."It is imperative to address the mindset of these militants," he added."After the Army Public School attack in which 137 innocent children belonging to military families who were fighting in tribal areas were targeted by terrorists as revenge their narrative was exposed at a huge cost," he said."After this, even the far right of the political fringes of Pakistan agreed that these militants were barbarians," he said.The military moved into North Waziristan to root out the terroristsHe said that many of these terrorists went to Afghanistan where they can easily operate while others went into the urban areas.Hence, we launched Operation Radd-Ul-Fassad to root them out.Consequently, we lost 6,000 soldiers, as well as, 23,000 civilians in the process.Secondly, with a drop in terrorist acts in the country and an improved law and order situation, the economic situation has picked up. The biggest source of investment is China with the CPEC project. Corporate America has also been rushing to invest in Pakistan after the project was rolled out."We have now reached the zero load shedding mark which is a big achievement for us," he added.He said that there has also been a rise in infrastructure investment with the construction of roads and highways in Balochistan with 1,100 kilometres of roads built."The youth bulge is also a big asset for our country with 207 million young people with about 58 per cent below the age of 30," he further added."This is a big asset for us if we can ensure that they are skilled," he claimed.He underscored the need to guarantee that the democratic process is uninterrupted for 11 years now.He highlighted the need to inculcate transparency and good governance in the process.[/fbvideo]

Pakistan is rolling up its sleeves as it prepares to face off against India in all important case before the world judicial body, as the top brass of the country will be briefed on the matter of Indian spy Kulbhushan Jhadav.Sources informed The Express Tribune that Pakistan’s legal team, led by its top attorney Khawar Qureshi, will give a briefing to Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi today (Thursday) on the details of the final memorandum, which would be filed before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on December 13.It was also learnt that the Foreign Office, the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP), and the military establishment are all working on finalising the memorandum. The federal government has also sought legal assistance from two top Pakistani lawyers as well. Qureshi, however, will lead Pakistan’s legal team. It is expected that final hearings of the case will be conducted in the next couple of months.India on September 13 submitted a 22-page memorandum wherein it objected to Jhadav being tried by a military court in Pakistan. The sources said India contended that Jadhav’s trial should have been conducted by a civilian court and that Pakistan was bound to give him counsellor access.The federal government has already appointed former chief justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani as an ad-hoc judge for the case at The Hague.Legal experts are urging all the stakeholders to increase coordination in devising the final draft of the memorandum. Recently, Pakistan has offered India a meeting of Jhadav with his wife on humanitarian grounds.The ICJ on May 18 halted the execution of Jhadav, who was sentenced to death by a military court on April 10 after being convicted on charges of terrorism and espionage.Sources revealed that Pakistan in its pleadings will be filing a dossier on various human rights violations committed by India in the past to highlight its lack of respect for human rights.“It will also be providing evidence of terror financing network which was penetrated and broken because of information revealed by Jhadav, including his confession,” they further informed.A senior lawyer, who has expertise in international law, contended that India cannot obtain an acquittal or the release of Jadhav on the basis of its application.Jhadev alias Hussain Mubarak Patel, a serving Indian Navy officer working with the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) – India’s premier intelligence agency – was apprehended on March 3, 2016, after he illegally crossed over into Pakistan via the Iran border.He was found in possession of an Indian passport issued by the Government of India on May 12, 2015, and valid until May 11, 2024. He confessed that he is a resident of Mumbai, India, still serving in the navy, and is scheduled to retire in 2022. The videos of his confession circulated widely in the media. He was convicted of espionage, sabotage, and terrorism by a field general court martial (FGCM) under Section 59 of the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) 1952 and Section 3 of the Official Secrets Act of 1923.He confessed before a magistrate and the court that he was tasked by RAW to plan, coordinate and organise espionage and sabotage activities aimed at destabilising Pakistan.Among the charges, he was convicted for were sponsoring and directing IEDs and grenade attacks in Gwadar and Turbat. He also directed attacks on the radar station and civilian boats in the sea, opposite Jiwani Port. He funded subversive secessionist and terrorist elements through hundi for turning Pakistani youth against the country, especially in Balochistan. He sponsored attacks on gas pipelines and other infrastructure, an IED explosion in Quetta in 2015, causing massive damage to life and property, and attacks on Hazaras in Quetta and Shia Zaireen en route to and from Iran.He abetted attacks through anti-state elements against LEAs in Turbat, Punjgur, Gwadar, Pasni and Jiwani during 2014-2015, killing and injuring many civilians and soldiers. He also launched a website with subversive content in support of anti-Pakistan elements. Pakistan repeatedly requested Indian assistance in the investigation but to no avail.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has informed India that the wife and mother of Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav alias Hussain Mubarak Patel, serving Commander of the Indian Navy, will be issued visas for a meeting at the end of this month. “The visit should happen on 25th December, 2017. A diplomat from the Indian High Commission in Islamabad will be allowed to accompany the visitors. Requisite security would be provided to the visitors,” spokesman at the Foreign Office announced today. “In what looks like a quid pro quo, India appears to have dropped the Pakistan specific condition of attaching a letter from the Pakistan foreign minister while applying for a medical visa. Indian officials say, “Now common man [Pakistanis] is directly calling Sushma ji on twitter and she is responding with visas. Jadhav, an undercover RAW officer, is presently on death row after he confessed to carrying out and facilitating acts of espionage and terrorism inside Pakistan. He was captured inside Balochistan. He was sentenced to death by the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) under the Pakistan Army Act. Earlier in November, the Pakistan Army had allowed Jadhav a meeting only with his wife on purely humanitarian grounds and based on Islamic traditions and jurisprudence. However, Jadhav’s wife was initially reluctant to travel alone to Pakistan and had requested for her mother-in-law Avantika Jadhav to accompany her. With India moving the International Court of Justice, which gave a stay for Jadhav’s execution, there was pressure from India and some world capitals to also allow the mother of Jadhav and an Indian official to also be present in the meeting, and complete security should be guaranteed to the visitors. Pakistan relented and the Foreign Office was conveyed of Rawalpindi’s decision, which in turn informed the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in New Delhi. There was quick reaction from India on Friday, which accepted Pakistan’s announcement, with Sushma Swaraj , Minister (MEA), tweeting, “Government of Pakistan has conveyed that they will give visa to the mother and wife of Kulbhushan Jadhav. Pakistan has agreed to facilitate the visit of mother and wife of Kulbhushan Jadhav and assured us of their safety, security and freedom of movement in Pakistan.” Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif has written to his Indian counterpart Sushma Swaraj regarding the provocative ceasefire violations by the Indian army and the recent extra-judicial killings of innocent Kashmiris. “In 2017, India had violated the Line of Control 1,300 times and as a result, 52 citizens had been killed and 175 had been injured. We also condemn the extra-judicial killings of eight young Kashmiris and destruction of houses by Indian forces,” said the spokesman. Pakistan has repeatedly raised its concerns about the hegemonic conduct of India, including the unprecedented escalation of ceasefire violations this year by Indian occupation forces at the Working Boundary and LoC in an attempt to deflect the attention of the international community from the continuing Indian atrocities against Kashmiris in Indian Held Kashmir. He also brushed aside an earlier statement made by CIA Director Mike Pompeo , made a day before the US Secretary of Defense reached Islamabad, warning Pakistan that the US would step in to destroy militant safe havens. “The statement that came a day before an important visit was unnecessary and contrary to the facts,” the spokesperson said, adding that during his visit, Mattis had praised the professional conduct of Pakistan’s armed forces. Meanwhile, the spokesperson noted that incidents of kidnapping of Pakistanis from Afghanistan are increasing. He asked Pakistani citizens in Afghanistan to take caution and register with the Pakistan Embassy on an urgent basis. “Pakistani nationals in Afghanistan are cautioned to exercise extreme vigilance as off-late senior professionals working in different fields have been kidnapped. Pakistanis either considering employment positions or currently working in Afghanistan must take into consideration their personal safety and well being before accepting employment or continuing their residency in Afghanistan,” he added. China too on Friday cautioned that Chinese-invested organisations and Chinese citizens to increase security awareness, strengthen internal precautions, reduce trips outside as much as possible, and avoid crowded public spaces because of imminent terrorist attacks against them. While the Air Force chief made claims that in future any US drone or other aircraft that trespasses inside Pakistan air space will be shot down, to a query the spokesman replied, “On drone strikes, our policy is clear and already in public domain. There is no change or policy shift.” In the past Pakistan has refrained from bringing down US drones. While former US President Barrack Obama compared his successor Donald Trump to Hitler for his policy to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the spokesman announced that since OIC is holding an emergency session in the next few days, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi will attend. “Our foreign minister will attend the Council of Foreign Minister’s Session of the OIC. We will follow the policy that OIC adopts at the end of this Emergency Session,” he remarked.

ISLAMABAD: Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav, currently on death row in Pakistan, has been allowed to meet with his family members from India. Pakistani authorities have finalized all the arrangements for the meeting, a Foreign Ministry official told Arab News. His wife and mother will travel to Pakistan to meet him on Dec. 25. Earlier this week, Islamabad accepted New Delhi’s demand to allow Jadhav’s mother, Avantika Jadhav, to travel with his wife, Chetna, to Pakistan and this has been formally communicated to India. Jadhav was arrested in March 2016 in the southwestern Pakistani province of Balochistan. Pakistan claims that Kulbushan Jadhav — alias Hussain Mubarak Patel — is a serving commander in the Indian Navy, working with Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing. However, New Delhi and Jadhav’s family maintain that he had quit the Indian Navy and was running a small business in Iran, from where he was kidnapped. Kulbushan Jadhav was sentenced to death by Pakistan’s military court in April 2017 on charges of espionage and terrorism. He has filed a clemency appeal with Pakistan’s army chief, which is pending. India moved to the International Court of Justice against the sentencing of Jadhav, after which the court ordered Pakistan not to execute Jadhav until it hears the case. Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammed Faisal said in a statement, available with Arab News, that Pakistan has informed India that it is ready to allow the visit of the mother of “Commander” Jadhav, along with his wife. India’s Ministry of External Affairs spokesman Raveesh Kumar said that this is a positive development. In November this year, Pakistan told India for the first time that it was ready to arrange a meeting between Jadhav and his wife. But New Delhi requested that Islamabad also allow his mother to travel with Jadhav’s wife and asked for security assurance for the visiting Indian family members. Sushma Swaraj, Indian external affairs minister, took to Twitter to comment on Pakistan’s decision. “Pakistan has agreed to facilitate the visit of mother and wife of Kulbhushan Jadhav and assured us of their safety, security and freedom of movement in Pakistan,” she tweeted. Analysts in Pakistan consider this development as an ice-breaker between South Asian neighbors India and Pakistan, who have stalled the peace dialogue after accusing each other of supporting terrorism. “Pakistan’s gesture will possibly help to lower the tension in bilateral relations,” Dr. Nadeem Mizra, assistant professor in the school of politics and international affairs at Quaid-e-Azam University, told Arab News. During the past two years, tensions have been high between Pakistan and India on Kashmir’s Line of Control, the de facto border between the two countries in Kashmir. Pakistan claimed that India committed unprecedented cease-fire violations along the Line of Control this year. In a statement, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said on Friday that “in 2017, more than 1,300 Indian cease-fire violations, the highest ever in the recent past, have resulted in 52 deaths and 175 were injured ... We have consistently stressed that Indian aggression is a threat to regional peace and tranquility.” Pakistan urged the Indian side to respect the 2003 cease-fire arrangement and investigate incidents of cease-fire violations.

RAWALPINDI: Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa on Tuesday said that Pakistan views the unresolved Palestinian issue at par with the Kashmir issue. The COAS reassured this to Ambassador of Palestine His Excellency Walid A.M. Abu Ali, who called on him at the General Head Quarters, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said. General Bajwa said that both, the Palestine and Kashmir issues, have unequivocal public, moral, and political support of the Pakistani nation. Pakistan will continue to support the principled stance on both regardless of the so-called reality of occupation, he added. Palestinian Ambassador Abu Ali thanked the COAS for Pakistan’s support to the Palestinian cause.

News article:
In his first appearance before a parliamentary forum, Chief of the Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa on Tuesday urged parliament to take lead role in policy making and not leave a vacuum.On invitation of the Senate chairman, Gen Bajwa came to the ‘committee of the whole house’ for an in-camera briefing along with the director general of Military Operations (DGMO), the Inter-Services Intelligence chief, and the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) DG. The briefing was followed by a question-and-answer session.“You are the policymakers. You should come up with policy guidelines. We will follow you,” Gen Bajwa was quoted as telling the senators.Sources privy to the marathon huddle told The Express Tribune that army chief was of the view that the country suffered on the foreign policy front when it did not have a full-time foreign minister for more than four years under the incumbent government.When he was asked about Pakistan joining a Saudi-led military alliance of Muslim countries and his predecessor’s role in it, he said former army chief Gen (retd) Raheel Sharif was leading the coalition in his personal capacity. “Our policy is what has been delineated in the April 10, 2015 resolution of parliament,” he said. The resolution was passed by joint session of parliament a few months after Saudi Arabia announced the formation of the military coalition.Through it, parliament had warned the government to act with caution while joining the alliance, taking into consideration delicacies of the relations with Iran.Gen Bajwa strongly denied any role of the army in recent issues that fomented political turmoil, including the Faizabad sit-in. “We had no role in the sit-in, Panama leaks, or Dawn leaks. We did not cause any of these issues,” a lawmaker quoted him as saying in reply to a question. The blockade of the crucial intersection of the twin cities by a religious group paralysed traffic for three weeks before the government signed a deal with the protesters.Most senators hailed the army chief’s appearance and said it had cleared many of the understandings and debunked conspiracy theories that were making rounds. They also appreciated his candidness in responding to their critical questions.The briefing came days after the National Assembly speaker expressed apprehensions that the assemblies might not complete their five-year term.Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, who heads the Senate defence committee, said he found the army chief “a straightforward person who played with a straight bat”.When a senator asked the COAS about recent newspaper articles by some retired military officers suggesting a presidential form of government, he clarified that the army was bound to follow the Constitution and there was no room for a presidential system in it. He said it could be the individual point of view of any person, but the military had nothing to do with it.DG ISPR Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor later told a private TV channel that there was no threat to the democratic system from the armed forces. The armed forces, as an institution of the state, would continue to work for the country’s security, he added.He said former military officers who appeared on TV channels as defence analysts expressed their personal points of view when they commented on any political issues. “They are allowed to express their views two years after retirement. When they speak on political issues, it is their personal point of view. It should never be taken as the armed forces’ opinion. However, when they speak on some defence issue, they speak on the basis of their experience,” he remarked.The military’s senior-most spokesman also praised the house, saying lawmakers should be well aware of the security challenges faced by the country.On a recent statement from US President Donald Trump that the US had been giving billions of dollars to Pakistan and it should take decisive action against terrorists, Gen Ghafoor said Pakistan had been doing what was in its best interest. The US has been giving reimbursements for Pakistan’s own spending. “The army chief has told them that we need nothing from the US. We want them to acknowledge our sacrifices.”“We want good relations with our neighbours. We want them to add to our security, nobody should be using their territory against us,” Gen Bajwa was quoted as telling lawmakers with reference to Pakistan’s relations with Afghanistan and Iran. He briefed the senators on his recent visits to Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and different aspects of military diplomacy at a time when the region was going through important geostrategic changes.According to a lawmaker, when some senators raised the issue of bad foreign policy pursuits from earlier years and the armed forces’ role in them, the army chief said, “We all made mistakes in the past. Let’s move on now.”The DGMO gave the senators a detailed briefing on the security challenges.

In his first appearance before a parliamentary forum, Chief of the Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa on Tuesday urged parliament to take lead role in policy making and not leave a vacuum.On invitation of the Senate chairman, Gen Bajwa came to the ‘committee of the whole house’ for an in-camera briefing along with the director general of Military Operations (DGMO), the Inter-Services Intelligence chief, and the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) DG. The briefing was followed by a question-and-answer session.“You are the policymakers. You should come up with policy guidelines. We will follow you,” Gen Bajwa was quoted as telling the senators.Sources privy to the marathon huddle told The Express Tribune that army chief was of the view that the country suffered on the foreign policy front when it did not have a full-time foreign minister for more than four years under the incumbent government.When he was asked about Pakistan joining a Saudi-led military alliance of Muslim countries and his predecessor’s role in it, he said former army chief Gen (retd) Raheel Sharif was leading the coalition in his personal capacity. “Our policy is what has been delineated in the April 10, 2015 resolution of parliament,” he said. The resolution was passed by joint session of parliament a few months after Saudi Arabia announced the formation of the military coalition.Through it, parliament had warned the government to act with caution while joining the alliance, taking into consideration delicacies of the relations with Iran.Gen Bajwa strongly denied any role of the army in recent issues that fomented political turmoil, including the Faizabad sit-in. “We had no role in the sit-in, Panama leaks, or Dawn leaks. We did not cause any of these issues,” a lawmaker quoted him as saying in reply to a question. The blockade of the crucial intersection of the twin cities by a religious group paralysed traffic for three weeks before the government signed a deal with the protesters.Most senators hailed the army chief’s appearance and said it had cleared many of the understandings and debunked conspiracy theories that were making rounds. They also appreciated his candidness in responding to their critical questions.The briefing came days after the National Assembly speaker expressed apprehensions that the assemblies might not complete their five-year term.Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, who heads the Senate defence committee, said he found the army chief “a straightforward person who played with a straight bat”.When a senator asked the COAS about recent newspaper articles by some retired military officers suggesting a presidential form of government, he clarified that the army was bound to follow the Constitution and there was no room for a presidential system in it. He said it could be the individual point of view of any person, but the military had nothing to do with it.DG ISPR Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor later told a private TV channel that there was no threat to the democratic system from the armed forces. The armed forces, as an institution of the state, would continue to work for the country’s security, he added.He said former military officers who appeared on TV channels as defence analysts expressed their personal points of view when they commented on any political issues. “They are allowed to express their views two years after retirement. When they speak on political issues, it is their personal point of view. It should never be taken as the armed forces’ opinion. However, when they speak on some defence issue, they speak on the basis of their experience,” he remarked.The military’s senior-most spokesman also praised the house, saying lawmakers should be well aware of the security challenges faced by the country.On a recent statement from US President Donald Trump that the US had been giving billions of dollars to Pakistan and it should take decisive action against terrorists, Gen Ghafoor said Pakistan had been doing what was in its best interest. The US has been giving reimbursements for Pakistan’s own spending. “The army chief has told them that we need nothing from the US. We want them to acknowledge our sacrifices.”“We want good relations with our neighbours. We want them to add to our security, nobody should be using their territory against us,” Gen Bajwa was quoted as telling lawmakers with reference to Pakistan’s relations with Afghanistan and Iran. He briefed the senators on his recent visits to Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and different aspects of military diplomacy at a time when the region was going through important geostrategic changes.According to a lawmaker, when some senators raised the issue of bad foreign policy pursuits from earlier years and the armed forces’ role in them, the army chief said, “We all made mistakes in the past. Let’s move on now.”The DGMO gave the senators a detailed briefing on the security challenges.

In a weekly briefing the spokesman termed the achievement as a big diplomatic success . He said Pakistan has allowed the list to become part of the declaration with positive thinking, but New Delhi used it as propaganda against Pakistan.

The wife and mother of an Indian naval officer facing the death penalty for espionage in Pakistan will arrive for a rare meeting with him in the country’s capital, despite lingering tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Sunday. Mohammad Faisal said India informed Islamabad about the visit on Saturday. He added that the two women will fly to Islamabad on Monday to meet with Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was arrested in March 2016 by Pakistani officials after he entered the country from neighboring Iran. Jadhav will be brought to the ministry for the meeting, and India wants Pakistan to bar journalists from speaking with the family members for security reasons. Advertisement A security official said the two women will meet with Jadhav in the presence of three Indian diplomats. “The mother and wife of Jadhav will be able to see and talk to him but there will be a partition between them for security reasons,” said the official, who is involved in making arrangements for the meeting. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to brief the media. Jadhav and his wife have petitioned the Pakistan army for a pardon, but have yet to receive a response. Pakistan says Jadhav was working for the Indian spy agency, RAW.

News article:
ISLAMABAD: Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif has said that Pakistan’s relationship with the United States has witnessed ups and downs. Talking in Geo News programme “Naya Pakistan” on Sunday, he said the US has “externaliset” the matter of war on terrorism. Talat Hussain hosted the programme. He said 90 percent of the problem is in Afghanistan. Now the US is externalising thisproblem, putting burden on Pakistan, he said. Looking at track record of the US over the last 9-10 years, one sometimes doubts if peace in Afghanistan is their aim or not, he said. “If you cannot keep peace with 100,000-strong army, how can you do it with 12,000?” he said. “In this situation, they say that partnering is not beneficial for peace. We, definitely cannot be partners in this situation. We got no benefits from the US partnership in the past. Rather, we suffered countless losses,” he said. He said he has doubts that the US desires peace in the region. “The US wants a sophisticated listening post here to monitor nuclear armed China, Pakistan and Russia. Iran is also here. Despite being part of Nato, Turkey has an independent policy. The US wants to monitor all these countries through its listening post,” he said. He said the establishment is strong in the US also, a facade of which is democracy. “What I feel as a student of politics in history, I see the face of establishment there despite the fact that they have Senate, Congress and administration,” he said. He said the US has said they are improving their infrastructure for which it needs more than $1 trillion. To do so, they will trigger conflicts and sell their weapons to the tune of $200-300 billion. They are also revamping their tax system to get more money, he said, adding that the US is also asking its Nato allies to return the money they have paid them over the last 15-20 years. “All this adds up to $1 trillion. Look at their infrastructure. Trains are falling, roads are broken, bridges are falling. Their infrastructure is 60-70-years-old,” he said. He said Pakistan has given New Delhi consular access to arrested Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav, Foreign Minister confirmed, after which he will be meeting his family at the Foreign Office on Monday (today). The mother and wife of Jadhav, who has been convicted of espionage and sabotage activities, will arrive in Pakistan early Monday and will return after meeting him, it has been learnt. Indian Deputy High Commissioner JP Singh will also be present at Monday's meeting between Jadhav and his family. Commander Jadhav — an on-duty Indian navy officer working for Indian covert agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) — was arrested on March 3, 2016, from Balochistan, after he entered into Pakistan from Iran. Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif, during his appearance on Geo News' programme 'Naya Pakistan', confirmed that India has been given consular access to the convicted spy, describing it as a "concession." "Had India been in place of us, it would not have given us this concession." He, however, said that Pakistan allowed Jadhav's meeting with his mother and wife purely on "humanitarian grounds." Noting that Jadhav's case is sub judice in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the minister said they were also advised to allow the meeting. "We didn't want any weakness in our case in the ICJ over the meeting." Asif further said that Pakistan could make a decision on Jadhav's mercy plea keeping its interests and security in view.

The Indian "spy", who was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court over espionage and sabotage charges, met his mother and wife at Foreign Office in Islamabad on Monday. "I requested a meeting with my wife and mother and I am thankful to the government of Pakistan for this grand gesture," Jadhav said in a video shot prior to the meeting. Jadhav's mother Avanti and wife Chetankul Jadhav was accompanied by the Deputy Indian High Commissioner JP Singh during the meeting, which lasted for 40 minutes. However, the Indian diplomat was not allowed to speak or listen to the conversation. The pictures, released by Pakistan's Foreign Office, showed Jadhav and his family members are separated by a glass screen as they talked to each other on phone. The 47-year-old Jadhav was arrested in March last year in Mashkel, a town a few kilometers (miles) from the Iranian border. According to Pakistani military, he was a serving Indian naval officer and using the Muslim name Hussein Mubarak Patel. However, New Delhi described him as a retired naval officer. After the meeting, Jadhav's mother and wife met the Foreign Office spokesman Mohammad Faisal and thanked the government of Pakistan and foreign office for arranging their meeting. "This is a very important day for Pakistan, being the birth anniversary of the Father of the nation, Quaid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. It was in this light that this day was chosen for the humanitarian meeting of Commander Jadhav with his wife and mother," Faisal told reporters shortly after the meeting. "Commander Jadhav -- an Indian spy, a terrorist and a saboteur -- is a serving Indian naval officer sentenced to death for his involvement in espionage, terrorism and subversive activities against Pakistan," Faisal recalled. "Let us be very clear that Commander Jadhav is the face of Indian terrorism, especially in Pakistan," the spokesman added. The military tribunal in Pakistan found him guilty of espionage and involved in terror acts, sentenced him to death in April this year. Later, Jadhav submitted a mercy petition to the Pakistan's army chief on compassionate grounds on June 2017, however, it is still pending and no decision has been taken so far.

News article:
NEW DELHI: India is debating the real intent behind Pakistan allowing Kulbhushan Jadhav, a convicted Indian spy facing the death sentence in a Pakistani jail, to meet his mother and wife. Jadhav’s mother Avanti Jadhav and wife Chetankul Jadhav, accompanied by the Indian Deputy High Commissioner J.P. Singh, met the former Indian navy officer in Islamabad on Monday afternoon. “It has happened due to international pressure,” said Suman Sharma, a New Delhi-based foreign affairs expert. “It is a tactical gesture by the Pakistan government before the next hearing at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which is hearing the case. Islamabad can argue in the ICJ that they are treating the case from the humanitarian points of view,” Sharma told Arab News. Dr. Zakir Husain of the Indian Council of World Affairs, a New Delhi based think-tank, said: “The larger point of this meeting is more than humanitarian. Pakistan is sending a signal that it is willing to break the ice with India and hold talks with its eastern neighbor.” Talking to Arab News, Husain underlined that “it’s now up to India how it responds to the Pakistani overtures. This comes just days after the Pakistani army chief’s announcement of his willingness to talk with India.” However, there was a lot of curiosity in Mumbai, the city where Jadhav’s family lives. “We are really excited about the meeting taking place in Islamabad,” said Subrato Mukherjee, an old friend of Jadhav in Mumbai. Talking to Arab News, Mukherjee said that “last week a bike rally and human chain were organized in the city to extend support to Jadhav’s family and express our solidarity with the family.” India does not accept the Pakistani version of the story that Jadav was arrested in Baluchistan province of Pakistan on March 3, 2016, and was acting as a spy to create disturbances in its territory. New Delhi, however, claims that Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran, where he went to do some business after his retirement from the Indian Navy. Jadhav’s case has created a frenzy in the Indian media with the majority calling Pakistan’s move “an optical illusion and choreographed exercise.” “On the question of Pakistan, Indian media loses its balance. We lose objectivity and sense of proportion,” said Sharma. “I feel the Jadhav case is a wonderful opportunity for both India and Pakistan to engage each other in dialogue. Had there been a regular mechanism of engagement between the two nations, we would not have had this kind of polarized debate and tension.”

News article:
Pakistan has warned the United States and President Donald Trump against taking unilateral military action in the country against extremist groups, after warnings from top officials in the president's administration and the American leader himself. Vice President Mike Pence said in a speech during a trip to Afghanistan earlier this month that Trump had issued a warning to Pakistan and cautioned that there was much for the country to lose if it aided extremist groups in any way. "As the president said, so I say now: Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with the U.S., and Pakistan has much to lose by continuing to harbor criminals and terrorists," Pence said. Relations between the U.S. and Pakistan have been fraught since it came to light that Osama bin Laden, the former Al-Qaeda leader and mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, was in hiding at a safe house in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad before the infamous U.S. Special Forces operation to kill him in 2011. Islamabad rejected the accusation that it could have been aiding extremist groups and was not doing enough to help Washington. "We have sacrificed a lot. We have paid a huge price both in blood and treasure. We have done enough, and we cannot do any more for anyone," Pakistani military spokesman Major-General Asif Ghafoor said Friday, according to Al-Jazeera. "Had we not supported [the U.S.], Al-Qaeda would not have been defeated," he continued. The country is battling an insurgency by the Pakistani Taliban, Al-Qaeda and a growing ISIS presence in the border regions with Afghanistan. The military has launched several major operations against these militant groups for several years. ISIS has continued to gain ground in Afghanistan, and Pakistan has made efforts to halt the militant group's spread to its territory. The jihadi group created an affiliate for the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region known as Khorasan Province, a historical name for the region. ISIS has conducted several attacks inside Pakistani territory, including suicide bombings against religious minorities the group considers to be heretical. The deadliest was the August 2016 suicide bombing that killed at least 70 people in the southwestern city of Quetta. While it has been conducting operations against militant groups, the Trump administration has been eager to press Pakistan to do more. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned Islamabad in an opinion piece in The New York Times published Wednesday. "We are prepared to partner with Pakistan to defeat terrorist organizations seeking safe havens, but Pakistan must demonstrate its desire to partner with us," he wrote. Despite the warnings, Trump praised Pakistan in October for working closely with U.S. authorities. "Starting to develop a much better relationship with Pakistan and its leaders. I want to thank them for their cooperation on many fronts," Trump wrote in a tweet. While the Pakistani government may want to work with the president, the Pakistani people are not so fond of the construction magnate. Thousands of Pakistani Islamists held rallies opposing Trump in two cities last week, condemning his declaration to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The December 6 announcement angered Muslims around the world. East Jerusalem hosts the third-holiest site in Islam, the Haram al-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary, which Jews also revere as the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism.

MULTAN: Speakers Thursday said the country was passing through a critical phase as the alliance of the United States, India and Israel may create troubles for Pakistan. Speakers expressed their views during a seminar on repercussions of US President Donald Trump’s Foreign Policy organised by Bahauddin Zakariya University’s Centre for International Studies on Thursday. Addressing the moot, BZU vice-chancellor Prof Dr Tahir Amin said the alliance of the US, Israel and India would harm regional peace and we can face a serious trouble at any time. He stressed the need of formulating country’s policies keeping in view the regional situation. Prof Dr Tahir Amin said current situation needed strong ties of Pakistan with the world. He said we should play a role of mediator not to become a party in an issue of Muslim countries. American Peace Institute for Pakistan Studies Director Prof Dr Farhat Haq said the US Foreign policy was the reflection of commitments made during the Trumps’ election campaign. Prof Dr Farhat Haq said the prime example of Donald Trump’s inexperience was evident from his decision of shifting of US embassy in Israel. BZU Centre for International Studies Director Prof Dr Muqarab Akbar also spoke.

News article:
Pakistan has decided to review its relations with the United States and adopt a tough stance, in the wake of President Donald Trump’s recent statement, it is learnt.Pakistan will highlight its sacrifices in the war against terrorism at the diplomatic front; and if the US reduces or suspends aid to Pakistan or places any sanctions, the country will completely revise its relations policy with the superpower, according to sources.Pakistan, said the sources, would not accept any demands to do more, and could stop all kinds of cooperation with the US. The only response to any ‘do more’ demands will be ‘no more’. The future policy with the US would be limited to ‘cooperation for cooperation’ and relations based on equality. “This policy will be adopted gradually,” they added.It is learnt that the foreign minister and other officials will contact friendly countries, including China, to take them into confidence. The high-ups are reviewing the recent statement by President Trump and the future relations with the US “which are turning from strained to tense”.It is decided that Pakistan will make its decisions keeping in view its national security, and the US defence secretary had been told during his visit to Islamabad that Pakistan would not accept any dictation from the US against its national security.He was also told that Pakistan was playing a role of frontline state in the war against terror. “There any no safe havens for terrorists in Pakistan, nor is Pakistan supporting any terrorist group directly or indirectly; and if US has any proof, it should hand it over to Pakistan.”The sources based in Islamabad said that the US had failed to provide any proof and was blaming Pakistan just to cover up its failures in Afghanistan. “The Trump administration is pressuring Pakistan, but Pakistan will not accept any pressure and face the situation.”Pakistan, according to the sources, has also decided to reduce dependency on the US in different fields and look for alternatives. It will also speed up the process of implementing its strategy for increasing diplomatic, trade and other relations with China, Russia and other countries.The sources said that the Trump administration was under pressure after the resolution in the United Nations General Assembly.Pakistan had supported the resolution calling on the US to withdraw its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Since then, the Trump administration has intensified pressure on Pakistan and is busy in levelling allegations which are meeting failure at the diplomatic level as well. Not a single important country is supporting the US stance. The US fears that if it moves any resolution against Pakistan in the UNGA, China or Russia may veto it.According to the sources, since the US understands the importance of Pakistan; the Trump administration will think several times before taking any action against Pakistan. “Any anti-Pakistan step may deprive the superpower of valuable cooperation.”They said that the federal government had also decided to take parliament into confidence on the current situation of the Pak-US relations, and the federal government would devise its future strategy on relations with the US in consultation with the military leadership.

The Pakistani government has summoned US ambassador David Hale to the nation's foreign office after US President Trump said the state was protecting terrorists. In a tweet, Trump accused Islamabad of "lies & deceit." Islamabad called on the US envoy to Pakistan David Hale to explain US President Donald Trump's claims that Pakistan was harboring and aiding jihadists from neighboring Afghanistan. Hale was summoned to Pakistan's foreign office on Monday, hours after the US president used his first tweet in 2018 to slam Pakistan for "lies & deceit." Trump also hinted at cutting or limiting US aid to Pakistan. "The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars (€29 billion) in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools," Trump wrote on Twitter. "They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!" The US embassy to Pakistan confirmed that the meet took place but refused to provide details on the conversation. "We don't have any comment on the substance of the meeting," a spokesman said. Pakistan Prime Minister Shahif Khaqan Abbasi is due to host a cabinet meeting that would focus on Trump's accusations on Tuesday, while country's top security officials would consider US ties on the next day. US trapped in a 'dead-end street' Following the tweet, Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said Trump's comments were motivated by US failures in Afghanistan. Asif also said Pakistan did not need US aid. "He has tweeted against us and Iran for his domestic consumption," Asif told Geo TV on Monday. "He is, again and again, displacing his frustrations on Pakistan over failures in Afghanistan as they are trapped in dead-end street in Afghanistan."

News article:
New Delhi has sought three-month time to file an additional memorial at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) which is hearing case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, a convicted Indian spy, sources have revealed to The Express TribuneLegal experts are, however, wondering why India is trying to drag the matter unnecessarily. A senior lawyer, who has expertise in international law, believes that under the ICJ rules, another round of submitting additional memorial can be started by both the parties.“If the ICJ gives three-month time to India then Pakistan may also avail similar period to file a counter memorial in the case. Generally, there are two rounds of filing memorial. After submission of memorial, the ICJ will give schedule of hearing,” he added.While submitting 1,700 pages counter memorial in the ICJ on December 13, Pakistan rejected Indian objection to not giving consular access to Jadhav, saying the provision of such an access under the Vienna Convention is only for legitimate visitors and not spies.Pakistan said since India did not deny Jadhav was travelling with an assumed Muslim name, they have no case to plead. India has sought consular access to Jadhav repeatedly but Pakistan has turned down its requests, citing bilateral accord that does not permit such an access to spies. However, on December 25 Islamabad allowed Jadhav’s mother and wife to meet with him on purely humanitarian grounds.It is learnt that the Foreign Office, attorney general for Pakistan (AGP), and military establishment gave their input to finalise the counter memorial. The government also sought assistance from two top lawyers of the country. However, the memorial was drafted by Pakistan’s top attorney Khawar Quraishi.According to sources, Pakistan stated in the memorial that the Indians have not denied that Jadhav was travelling on a passport with an assumed Muslim name.It said India did not explain how a serving naval commander, operating under Indian spy agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), was travelling under an assumed name. This leads to only one conclusion that India seeks consular access to the information he [Jadhav] had gathered, it added.It said since Jadhav was on active duty, it is obvious that he was a spy sent on a special mission. “Only a state which adheres to legitimate actions can request the court to intervene in a matter between two states. A state which does not come with clean hands cannot get any relief,” Pakistan contended.Pakistan further said sending Jadhav for espionage and funding terrorist activities were some of the reasons that disentitle India from invoking jurisdiction of the ICJ.Sources said Pakistan also highlighted constant violations of human rights by India in occupied-Kashmir. It said India is a habitual violator of human rights and has not honoured the UN resolutions on Kashmir.“Giving of false identity to Kulbhushan, sending him for espionage and funding of terrorists activities are all some of the reasons which disentitle India from invoking jurisdiction of the ICJ,” said counter memorial according to a source. The ICJ will decide the schedule of hearing within 15 days.India on September 13 submitted a 22-page memorandum wherein it objected to Jadhav being tried by a military court in Pakistan. The sources said India contended that Jadhav’s trial should have been conducted by a civilian court and that Pakistan was bound to give him consular access.The federal government has already appointed former chief justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani as an ad-hoc judge for the case at The Hague. Legal experts are urging all the stakeholders to increase coordination in devising the final draft of the memorandum.The ICJ on May 18 halted the execution of Jadhav, who was sentenced to death by a military court on April 10 after being convicted on charges of terrorism and espionage.Jadhav alias Hussain Mubarak Patel, a serving Indian Navy officer working for the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) was apprehended on March 3, 2016, after he illegally crossed into Pakistan via Iran border.

New Delhi has sought three-month time to file an additional memorial at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) which is hearing case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, a convicted Indian spy, sources have revealed to The Express TribuneLegal experts are, however, wondering why India is trying to drag the matter unnecessarily. A senior lawyer, who has expertise in international law, believes that under the ICJ rules, another round of submitting additional memorial can be started by both the parties.“If the ICJ gives three-month time to India then Pakistan may also avail similar period to file a counter memorial in the case. Generally, there are two rounds of filing memorial. After submission of memorial, the ICJ will give schedule of hearing,” he added.While submitting 1,700 pages counter memorial in the ICJ on December 13, Pakistan rejected Indian objection to not giving consular access to Jadhav, saying the provision of such an access under the Vienna Convention is only for legitimate visitors and not spies.Pakistan said since India did not deny Jadhav was travelling with an assumed Muslim name, they have no case to plead. India has sought consular access to Jadhav repeatedly but Pakistan has turned down its requests, citing bilateral accord that does not permit such an access to spies. However, on December 25 Islamabad allowed Jadhav’s mother and wife to meet with him on purely humanitarian grounds.It is learnt that the Foreign Office, attorney general for Pakistan (AGP), and military establishment gave their input to finalise the counter memorial. The government also sought assistance from two top lawyers of the country. However, the memorial was drafted by Pakistan’s top attorney Khawar Quraishi.According to sources, Pakistan stated in the memorial that the Indians have not denied that Jadhav was travelling on a passport with an assumed Muslim name.It said India did not explain how a serving naval commander, operating under Indian spy agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), was travelling under an assumed name. This leads to only one conclusion that India seeks consular access to the information he [Jadhav] had gathered, it added.It said since Jadhav was on active duty, it is obvious that he was a spy sent on a special mission. “Only a state which adheres to legitimate actions can request the court to intervene in a matter between two states. A state which does not come with clean hands cannot get any relief,” Pakistan contended.Pakistan further said sending Jadhav for espionage and funding terrorist activities were some of the reasons that disentitle India from invoking jurisdiction of the ICJ.Sources said Pakistan also highlighted constant violations of human rights by India in occupied-Kashmir. It said India is a habitual violator of human rights and has not honoured the UN resolutions on Kashmir.“Giving of false identity to Kulbhushan, sending him for espionage and funding of terrorists activities are all some of the reasons which disentitle India from invoking jurisdiction of the ICJ,” said counter memorial according to a source. The ICJ will decide the schedule of hearing within 15 days.India on September 13 submitted a 22-page memorandum wherein it objected to Jadhav being tried by a military court in Pakistan. The sources said India contended that Jadhav’s trial should have been conducted by a civilian court and that Pakistan was bound to give him consular access.The federal government has already appointed former chief justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani as an ad-hoc judge for the case at The Hague. Legal experts are urging all the stakeholders to increase coordination in devising the final draft of the memorandum.The ICJ on May 18 halted the execution of Jadhav, who was sentenced to death by a military court on April 10 after being convicted on charges of terrorism and espionage.Jadhav alias Hussain Mubarak Patel, a serving Indian Navy officer working for the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) was apprehended on March 3, 2016, after he illegally crossed into Pakistan via Iran border.

News article:
On Thursday, the U.S. State Department added Pakistan to a watch list for religious freedom violations. This follows an angry tweet from Donald Trump about Pakistan, and a more substantive cut-off of U.S. security assistance. Pakistan has faced years of criticism for its failure to disrupt terrorist activity within its borders and its persistent violations of religious freedom. Should those of us worried about the status of religious freedom be heartened by this move? Unfortunately, the answer is no. There is no indication the Trump Administration will actually follow through with these actions to call for reforms in Pakistan. Tensions between Trump and Pakistan have been growing for months. In an August 2016 speech on his Afghanistan strategy, Trump criticized Pakistan, accusing it of “housing the very terrorists we fight.” And then on New Year’s Day, Trump sent an angry tweet about Pakistan, threatening to cut off U.S. aid. This week, he followed through, suspending U.S. aid. To the surprise of some, the Administration also called out Pakistan for human rights abuses, placing it on a watch list for religious freedom violations. The Trump administration’s actions may appear abrupt, but they reflect long-standing concerns. Pakistan and the United States have had a tense relationship on counterterrorism since the 1990s. The United States was initially critical of Pakistan’s support for Kashmiri militant groups. This expanded to concerns about al-Qaeda due to Pakistan’s ties to the Taliban — which hosted Osama bin Ladin — and blind eye towards al-Qaeda operatives. As I discussed in my book, while Pakistan did cooperate with America in some very important ways after 9/11, it continued to allow terrorists to operate in its territory. Advertisement Pakistan’s religious freedom record is also a problem. The country’s blasphemy laws have enabled vigilante violence against religious minorities — particularly Christians — and the authorities have done little to stop this violence. Additionally, Ahmadi Muslims face both social and governmental discrimination and harassment. The government also has favored hard-line Islamist groups for decades, giving these groups significant sway over the society to the detriment of Muslims and non-Muslims. When I ran the Pew Research Center’s work on religious freedom, Pakistan was consistently among the most repressive countries in the world. So I should be happy with the Trump administration’s actions. It is taking steps to pressure Pakistan on counterterrorism while also clearly condemning its religious freedom violations. But as with other aspects of its foreign policy, this administration is doing the right thing for the wrong reason. It is also unlikely to follow through. First, there is no indication this administration is committed to religious freedom. While Trump has made a big show of domestic religious freedom debates, international human rights promotion is not a priority. Secretary of State Tillerson announced that advancing U.S. values can be “an obstacle” for U.S. interests. In this case, condemning Pakistan is in line with Trump’s security priorities, but religious freedom is clearly the secondary issue here. Advancing religious freedom requires not just cutting off aid, but working with states to reform their policies. I don’t see that happening under Trump. Second, even if Trump was serious on increasing religious freedom in Pakistan, how would he do it? Under Tillerson, the State Department has been gutted. State Department employees — including its religious freedom office — appear to be valiantly attempting to continue their mission despite Tillerson’s cuts. But actually advancing religious freedom will require engagement on religious issues and close monitoring to ensure compliance. As with Trump’s declaration on ISIL’s genocide, rhetoric will not translate into actions without a fully-staffed, well-supported State Department. Moreover, Trump’s belligerent, confrontational style will undermine existing initiatives; Pakistani political figures are calling on their government to “remove” U.S. diplomatic personnel in response to Trump’s actions. Advertisement Some may accuse me of being cranky, or biased against Trump. But religious freedom advocates need to be very careful. Trump is saying the right things, but there is little indication he will actually act on international religious freedom. We have seen this repeatedly over the past year. Besides Tillerson’s dismissal of “values,” there is also Vice President Pence’s trip to the Middle East, meant to show solidarity with Middle East Christians; it was postponed after the furor over Trump’s statements on Jerusalem, and there is no indication it will be rescheduled.

News article:
By IPCS By Abhijit Iyer Mitra* On Friday, 29 December 2017, the Government of India faced a major public embarrassment, one that provides some insights into the failure of intelligence. What it shows is one of three things: a failure of gathering, collation and transmission of intelligence; a failure to archive, collate and assess foreign policy; or, possibly, a serial failure of both intelligence and foreign policy fronts and a diagnostics problem within the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). Background On 21 December, India voted for a resolution at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), condemning the US’ decision to shift its embassy to Jerusalem (a move thus supportive of the Palestinian position and condemnatory of the Israeli and US position). On 29 December, pictures started circulating on the Internet of a meeting between the Palestinian ambassador to Pakistan, Walid Abu Ali, and wanted terrorist, head of the Jamaat ud-Dawa (JuD), and founder of the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT), Hafiz Saeed. By the time India lodged a diplomatic protest and Palestine formally recalled Abu Ali, documentary and photographic evidence emerged of at least two previous meetings (August 2014 and December 2014). While knowledge of these meetings may not have changed India’s vote, the Ministry of External Affairs’ (MEA) actions in dealing with the snafu seems to indicate no prior knowledge of the meetings, which was particularly galling in the backdrop of the 21 December vote. Implications Hafiz Saeed is one of India’s most wanted men, responsible for masterminding the 26/11 Mumbai attacks and the 2006 Mumbai train bombings, and as such a prime target for 24/7 surveillance by India. Given his accessibility to the public, keeping tabs on him is not particularly challenging, complemented by the Difa-e-Pakistan Twitter handle and coverage by Pakistani newspapers. This points to one of two possibilities. Either Indian intelligence is not equipped to perform such basic OSINT activities as what Indian Twitter users can. Or, such intelligence existed but was buried deep in the system and could not be archived for efficient extraction when required to make policy decisions, either on 21 December when the UN vote happened, or indeed on 29 December when pictures of the December 2017 meeting surfaced. What is however known for a fact is that even after the situation blew up publicly, the diplomatic protest note sent to the Palestinians referred only to the December 2017 meeting, which indicates that the MEA had no knowledge of the previous meetings (by this time, the open source verification of previous meetings had not emerged). This is particularly worrying as it implies that either the MEA did not seek intelligence inputs on previous meetings, or that despite requests such inputs were not provided, that there was no intelligence on the subject to provide, or that the MEA decision was taken despite knowing the scale and extent of links between the Palestinian Authority and Hafiz Saeed. While the last option points to questionable policymaking, the previous three possibilities beg the question, why has the MEA not invested in public source intelligence gathering or outsourcing the work to a think-tank? This is all the more jarring given the minister-in-charge’s penchant for playing twitter agony-aunt. If it is assumed that the MEA has in fact invested in such open source intelligence gathering, then clearly the archiving and retrieval systems were not in place for such intelligence to be used rapidly and in a policy-relevant manner. What is most indicative of systemic failure on the MEA’s part is the Palestinian explanation, which was accepted without demur by South Block. First, it made the Palestinian state’s regret over its ambassador’s actions conditional, dependent on India’s continuing support to the Palestinian position. Second, it claimed the meeting was a mistake, ignoring the fact that there were several meetings. Incredulously this would also lead on to accept that Walid Abu Ali, a former Palestinian Intelligence official, did not know who he was deep in conversation with, given the fact that the LeT was co-founded by a Palestinian, Abdullah Azzam, who for a while had cooperated with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) against Israel. Finally, the PMO’s functioning must be examined. By all accounts this is a prime minister who takes a great deal of interest in foreign policy. That the PM has not been able to diagnose and institute rectifying measures since the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) debacle (where official statements emanating from Delhi were in significant variance from ground reports from Vienna and Seoul) does not instil confidence in his stewardship of intelligence matters. Depending on preferences and biases, it can be concluded that either intelligence or the MEA have been tried and found wanting, or that all have failed in equal measure, as there were no redundancies in place to damage control the situation. What is however undeniable is the PMO has neither diagnosed the problem over the last three years, or taken corrective action. * Abhijit Iyer Mitra Senior Research Fellow, IPCS

The ties between the US and Pakistan further deteriorated after the US president had tweeted that his country made an unwise decision to provide over $33 billion aid to Pakistan in the last 15 years.In his tweet, Trump had accused Pakistan of giving nothing in return except lies and deceit by taking the US for a fool, saying, “They give safe havens to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!”Meanwhile in a related development reflecting on worsening ties, the US ambassador to Pakistan was summoned to the Foreign Office and a strong protest over Trump’s remarks was lodged with him.On the other hand, ties between Iran and Pakistan are improving especially a new turn in the bilateral ties came after the historic visit of Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajawa to Tehran in November last year.Iran and Pakistan have been enjoying strong brotherly relations since the creation of Pakistan way back in 1947. Since then the two countries have always been supporting each other on world issues.The last year has seen major developments in Iran-Pakistan ties and it is expected that the year proved to be fruitful for relations between the two neighboring states in the coming year as well.In a recent development, Pakistan Prime Minister's National Security Adviser (NSA) Lt Gen (retd) Nasser Janjua has gone to Iran to discuss regional developments and bilateral ties.During his meeting with secretary of Iran’s National Security Council Ali Shamkhani, Janjua said that Pakistan will improve its security and economic relations with its neighboring country, Iran.On the other hand, Shamkhani slammed the US statements against Pakistan and Iran. He said that US policy is hypocritical. “We have to continue to work on cooperating against the US.”Criticizing the US new national security strategy that will increase insecurity and instability in the world, Shamkhani said that the double-standard and rift-widening policies of the US against Muslim countries, including Iran and Pakistan, necessitate alertness and deterring measures and expansion of ties among Muslim countries.Meanwhile Iranian Minister of Defense Brigadier General Amir Hatami in a telephone conversation with his Pakistani counterpart Khurram Dastagir Khan said that the US has always blamed others for its defeats in various parts of the world and pursued the Zionists approach to destabilize the region.Pakistani defense minister, for his part, welcomed expansion of defense cooperation between the two sides, and said rapid developments require closer cooperation between Iran and Pakistan.Both the ministers also agreed that recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Zionist regime by the United States had violated international understanding and destabilized the Middle East.Iran and Pakistan are also trying to enhance bilateral trade ties and leaders of the two countries have agreed to enhance the bilateral trade volume up to $5 billion by 2021.272**6125**1771Follow us on Twitter @IrnaEnglish

Iran on Sunday urged Muslim nations to forge closer cooperation to counter the US policy of seeking to create division among them."The US' dishonest, duplicitous and divisive policy towards Muslim countries, including Iran and Pakistan, requires that they bolster cooperation against the US in addition to maintaining vigilance and taking preventive measures," Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, was quoted as saying by Iran’s state-owned Press TV.Shamkhani made the remarks during a meeting with National Security Adviser Nasser Khan Janjua, whose country has recently come under criticism by US President Donald Trump."We will not allow some countries to affect relations between the two countries through sending weapons and hiring terrorists to create insecurity on their borders," Shamkhani said.Recalling the historical and civilisation relations as well as the many cultural and religious ties between the two countries, Shamkhani highlighted the importance of the expansion of relations and cooperation for mutually reinforcing in various fields, especially against common threats.“Activating mechanisms for bilateral cooperation and designing joint procedures, in accordance with the changing components of threats, is one of the immediate measures that should be taken seriously by the relevant agencies in the two countries,” highlighted the Iranian official.For his part, Janjua said that Pakistan will expand cooperation with Iran in security and economic areas.Janjua also said Islamic countries should raise awareness to counter foreign plots which are being hatched to spread division among the Muslims.“Pakistan will strengthen its security and economic cooperation with the Islamic Republic of Iran,” he reiterated.“Islamabad welcomes new areas created for developing joint economic, commercial and trade cooperation,” he added.Shamkhani also criticised the US new national security strategy (NSS), saying it will spread insecurity and instability in the world.The remarks by the Iranian security chief came two days after Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said that he sees his country’s alliance with Washington as over after the US suspended security-related aid to Pakistan and levelled charges against Islamabad.“We do not have any alliance,” with the US, Khawaja Muhammad Asif said in an interview. “This is not how allies behave.”In announcing the strategy, Trump also targeted China and Russia.Referring to China, together with Russia, as rival and revisionist powers, Trump sharply criticised China for challenging American power.The United States’ severe allegations immediately sparked a backlash from China. The Chinese Foreign Ministry reprimanded the United States for “malicious slander.”The NSS laid forward the Trump administration’s harshest stance toward China since Trump took office in January last year.Singling China out for 33 mentions, the report bluntly criticized China for seeking to “challenge American influence, values, and wealth,” “attempting to erode American security and prosperity,” and using “technology, propaganda, and coercion to shape a world antithetical to” U.S. interests and values.Specifically, the NSS claimed that “China seeks to displace the United States in the Indo-Pacific region, expand the reaches of its state-driven economic model, and reorder the region in its favour.”

Trump anti-Pakistan tirade to bring Iran, Pakistan closer IRNA – U.S. President Donald Trump’s harsh strategy towards Pakistan has created a space for closer Iran, Pakistan ties as the two countries have vowed to expand cooperation against common US-posed threats. The ties between the US and Pakistan further deteriorated after the US president had tweeted that his country made an unwise decision to provide over $33 billion aid to Pakistan in the last 15 years. In his tweet, Trump had accused Pakistan of giving nothing in return except lies and deceit by taking the US for a fool, saying, “They give safe havens to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!” Meanwhile in a related development reflecting on worsening ties, the US ambassador to Pakistan was summoned to the Foreign Office and a strong protest over Trump’s remarks was lodged with him. On the other hand, ties between Iran and Pakistan are improving especially a new turn in the bilateral ties came after the historic visit of Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajawa to Tehran in November last year. Iran and Pakistan have been enjoying strong brotherly relations since the creation of Pakistan way back in 1947. Since then the two countries have always been supporting each other on world issues. The last year has seen major developments in Iran-Pakistan ties and it is expected that the year proved to be fruitful for relations between the two neighboring states in the coming year as well. In a recent development, Pakistan Prime Minister’s National Security Adviser (NSA) Lt Gen (retd) Nasser Janjua has gone to Iran to discuss regional developments and bilateral ties. During his meeting with secretary of Iran’s National Security Council Ali Shamkhani, Janjua said that Pakistan will improve its security and economic relations with its neighboring country, Iran. On the other hand, Shamkhani slammed the US statements against Pakistan and Iran. He said that US policy is hypocritical. “We have to continue to work on cooperating against the US.” Criticizing the US new national security strategy that will increase insecurity and instability in the world, Shamkhani said that the double-standard and rift-widening policies of the US against Muslim countries, including Iran and Pakistan, necessitate alertness and deterring measures and expansion of ties among Muslim countries. Meanwhile Iranian Minister of Defense Brigadier General Amir Hatami in a telephone conversation with his Pakistani counterpart Khurram Dastagir Khan said that the US has always blamed others for its defeats in various parts of the world and pursued the Zionists approach to destabilize the region. Pakistani defense minister, for his part, welcomed expansion of defense cooperation between the two sides, and said rapid developments require closer cooperation between Iran and Pakistan. Both the ministers also agreed that recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Zionist regime by the United States had violated international understanding and destabilized the Middle East. Iran and Pakistan are also trying to enhance bilateral trade ties and leaders of the two countries have agreed to enhance the bilateral trade volume up to $5 billion by 2021.

ISLAMABAD: Minister for Defence Engineer Khurram Dastgir Khan on Tuesday said that intelligence and defence cooperation with the United States (US) had been suspended and it was high time for Pakistan to have 'ruthlessly candid dialogue' with the US with everything on the table. He was speaking at a pubic talk entitled "Contours of Security Environment in Pakistan" organised here at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI). Khurram Dastgir said that US, in spite of spending billions of dollars and getting its soldiers killed, could not win the Afghan war as it had only managed to control 40 percent of Afghanistan during the last 15 years. "America needs to deal with that ungoverned area before it points fingers towards Pakistan's role in Afghan peace process," he added. "US military aid suspension to Pakistan has no importance. At the same time, strategic dialogue between the two countries has also faced suspension for last two years. High level dialogues with US would not work until resumption and consistency in working level dialogues," he said. Khurram Dastgir said that US allegations and illogical demands have affected serious the efforts, made by Pakistan to ensure peace in region as well as the world. He said sacrifices of Pakistan in war against terrorism were above board and it would not allow anyone to make it a scapegoat and bring Afghan war on its soil. He said Pakistan had been facing challenges where it had been confronting with external threat on eastern border with India and facing internal threat due to terrorism. The minister said the successful conduct of operation with Zarb-e-Azb and ongoing Raddul Fasaad had made Pakistan and region a citadel of peace. Replying to a question, he said presence of Afghan refugees in large number in Pakistan was also another cause of internal instability. The decision of extension for a month stay of Afghan refugees in Pakistan has been taken by the Cabinet, he added. The minister said a sustainable peace in Afghanistan was part of Pakistan's foreign policy. Answering another question, Khurram Dastgir said Pakistan and China were partners and all weather friends. Multi-billion dollars project of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) would bring development and prosperity, not only in Pakistan but also in the region. "CPEC is the first ever project in history of Pak-China relationship that will actually bring economical success to region," he added. Regarding Indian hostile attitude, he said, Pakistan desires solution of all outstanding issue with India but its aggression along the Line of Control (LoC) and Working Boundary was a matter of concern. He said US deemed India as its strategic partner in region, and it has been trying to convince Pakistan not to see India as a threat while Pakistan clearly sees India as a threat to its peace and stability. Khurram said the bilateral relations with regional countries like Russia and Iran were improving. "Pak-Russia conducted joint military exercises. Visit of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) to Tehran is proving to be step forward in strengthening mutual relationship with regional countries," he said. In his concluding remarks, Chairman Ambassador Khalid Mahmood said that world should not ignore Pakistan's sacrifices in war against terrorism. Pakistan has been a front line state in this war and Pakistanis have bought this peace with their blood, he added. Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad is denying Pakistan’s claims it has suspended military or intelligence cooperation with the United States. Embassy spokesman Richard Snelsire said, “We have not received any formal communication regarding a suspension.”

News article:
Reports emerged this week that more than 10,000 Afghan fighters deployed by Iran to defend the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad have been killed or injured in the past five years. Fazal Hadi Muslimyar, chairman of Meshrano Jirga, has said, “Iran is abusing Afghan refugees and sending them to the war in Syria and Iraq, where more than 2,000 Afghans have been killed,” he told lawmakers on January 9. “I am calling on the Afghan president, the chief executive, and the Foreign Affairs Ministry to lodge a complaint with the Iranian ambassador on this matter.” Muslimyar had criticized the Afghan government for refusing to actively pursue the issue on the diplomatic front on the previous day. He told Radio Free Afghanistan, “They should formally complain and seek help from the members of the United Nations Security Council with whom we have strategic security agreements.” His call for a diplomatic initiative is backed by fellow lawmakers, like Aryan Yoon, a female member of Wolesi Jirga or lower house of the Afghan Parliament. “Kabul should suspend its bilateral relations with Tehran,” she told Radio Free Afghanistan. “The Afghan government also needs to raise this issue at international forums and even lodge formal complaints with international bodies that Iran is interfering in its domestic affairs and abusing refugees.” Lawmaker Abdul Qadir Zazai Watandost says Wolesi Jirga’s foreign relations committee is investigating the issue. “This issue will be part of our general agenda after the winter recess [in February],” he said. An official for the Fatemiyoun Divison, Zohair Mojahed, said that since 2012 at least 10,000 Afghans have either been killed or wounded while fighting for al-Assad. He told Iran’s Shargh newspaper on January 6th, “This brigade has given more than 2,000 martyrs and 8,000 wounded for Islam.” Members of the Fatemiyoun Division are estimated to be some 20,000, most of whom were recruited from among Afghanistan’s Shi’ite Hazara minority. Deputy Afghan Chief Executive Mohammad Mohaqiq, a Hazara politician, came under fire last November for seeming to confirm that thousands of Afghan recruits are fighting in Syria on Iran’s behalf. “I thank all the warriors who cooperated in these wars from Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and other parts of the world,” Mohaqiq said at an event in Iran. He also praised Major General Qasem Soleimani, foreign operations commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, who is credited with founding the Fatemiyoun Division. Presidential spokesman Shah Hussain Murtazawi was critical. “We have repeatedly expressed our opposition to all kinds of proxy wars in Afghanistan,” he said. “Similarly, we oppose such wars everywhere. We do not want the blood of our children being spilled for foreign interests in other countries.” However, spokesman for the Afghan Foreign Ministry, Sibghatullah Ahmadi says Kabul has raised the issue with Tehran and the United Nations. He told Radio Free Afghanistan, “We have discussed this issue with the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the relevant Iranian authorities.” He added, “We hope the vulnerability of Afghan refugees is not being exploited and that our complaints are seriously addressed on time.” Tehran has not responded to complaints or criticism from Afghanistan. Still, Iranian media frequently reports on the funerals of Afghan fighters killed in Syria. Abdul Baqi Baryal, a member of Meshrano Jirga, is pushing for Kabul to address the issue immediately. According to what he told Radio Free Afghanistan, the Afghan Constitution allows the country’s citizens to only fight under its flag. “This is a very painful issue. We need to talk seriously about this with Iran soon,” he said.

In reference your story US suspending more than $255 million in security aid to Pakistan (January 5) and the harsh tweets by president Donald Trump about Pakistan not co-operating fully to control terrorism, Pakistan must be very upset with the halting of aid and the strong comments of Mr Trump. However there is an opportunity in every crisis. Pakistan should endeavour to generate its own resources to fight terrorism in the country. Why depend on money from other countries to manage law and order at home? Pakistan is rich in agriculture, industry and textiles. Pakistan should focus on exports and generate adequate revenues so that it is self-sufficient. Self-help is the best help. Rajendra Aneja, Dubai Iran needs new leadership Regarding your story US and France agree on Iran regime's failure to serve people (January 8), the time of bad government in Iran has to come to an end. There has to be a new system of politics working in the direction of peace. Asyah Elisabeth Meel, Abu Dhabi VAT threatens the agility of the UAE's economy In reference to your leader The Government's VAT pledge gives a taste of our economic future (January 8), VAT is a redistributionist construct, so it is not hard to understand why redistribution should be promoted as its benefit. What is hard to understand is that, given the golden opportunity of developing the UAE's post-oil economy, the authorities have chosen to adopt this tax, where the cost ends up in the lap of the consumer, with often the least able bearing the greatest burden on their net income. The UAE's economy needs its agility to compete in the global marketplace. Andy Preston, Abu Dhabi Good conduct certificates are good in theory, but will they work in practice? In response to your story UAE to introduce 'good conduct certificate' requirement for work visas (January 8), where do these certificates come from if you have been a resident working expat for 23 years in the UAE? Or a born-and-brought-up expat here who has never worked outside the country? Tanya Milbourne, Dubai The UAE authorities already perform a background check on expatriate workers, so how is this any different? Sam Anderson, Abu Dhabi The UAE's effort to contain deadly Australian flu deserves applause In response to your story Deadly Australian flu spreads across the world (January 9), this is only the latest development in the spread of the deadly Australian flu across the globe, including America. That doctors in the UAE are calling for vaccination as a preventive measure after one patient's death is laudable. The World Health Organisation should immediately take measures to prevent this flu further. K Ragavan, India The US and Israel should stop bullying the Palestinians In response to your article Sweden warns against US cutting UN aid to Palestinians (January 10), it is about time to end the illegal occupation of Palestine. The United States should put pressure on Israel to end the longest and ugliest occupation in modern history, instead of bullying the Palestinian victims of the belligerent apartheid Israeli regime.

In reference your story US suspending more than $255 million in security aid to Pakistan (January 5) and the harsh tweets by president Donald Trump about Pakistan not co-operating fully to control terrorism, Pakistan must be very upset with the halting of aid and the strong comments of Mr Trump. However there is an opportunity in every crisis. Pakistan should endeavour to generate its own resources to fight terrorism in the country. Why depend on money from other countries to manage law and order at home? Pakistan is rich in agriculture, industry and textiles. Pakistan should focus on exports and generate adequate revenues so that it is self-sufficient. Self-help is the best help. Rajendra Aneja, Dubai Iran needs new leadership Regarding your story US and France agree on Iran regime's failure to serve people (January 8), the time of bad government in Iran has to come to an end. There has to be a new system of politics working in the direction of peace. Asyah Elisabeth Meel, Abu Dhabi VAT threatens the agility of the UAE's economy In reference to your leader The Government's VAT pledge gives a taste of our economic future (January 8), VAT is a redistributionist construct, so it is not hard to understand why redistribution should be promoted as its benefit. What is hard to understand is that, given the golden opportunity of developing the UAE's post-oil economy, the authorities have chosen to adopt this tax, where the cost ends up in the lap of the consumer, with often the least able bearing the greatest burden on their net income. The UAE's economy needs its agility to compete in the global marketplace. Andy Preston, Abu Dhabi Good conduct certificates are good in theory, but will they work in practice? In response to your story UAE to introduce 'good conduct certificate' requirement for work visas (January 8), where do these certificates come from if you have been a resident working expat for 23 years in the UAE? Or a born-and-brought-up expat here who has never worked outside the country? Tanya Milbourne, Dubai The UAE authorities already perform a background check on expatriate workers, so how is this any different? Sam Anderson, Abu Dhabi The UAE's effort to contain deadly Australian flu deserves applause In response to your story Deadly Australian flu spreads across the world (January 9), this is only the latest development in the spread of the deadly Australian flu across the globe, including America. That doctors in the UAE are calling for vaccination as a preventive measure after one patient's death is laudable. The World Health Organisation should immediately take measures to prevent this flu further. K Ragavan, India The US and Israel should stop bullying the Palestinians In response to your article Sweden warns against US cutting UN aid to Palestinians (January 10), it is about time to end the illegal occupation of Palestine. The United States should put pressure on Israel to end the longest and ugliest occupation in modern history, instead of bullying the Palestinian victims of the belligerent apartheid Israeli regime.

News article:
Defence Minister Khurram Dastagir on Monday asked the United States whether Pakistan should put a price tag on the Ground Line of Communications (GLOCs) and Air Line of Communications (ALOCs) which averages 314 daily with use of ports and air bases and other mutual communications.The minister was giving a policy statement in the National Assembly, where he gave an overarching picture of the country’s Defence and foreign policy.Dastagir stated that the way forward for the Pak-US relations was not through threats, notices and suspension of support.“This is Pakistani foreign policy and we have cleared safe havens from our country and are also removing the remnants but we are equally determined that the Afghan war will not be fought on Pakistani soil,” he said.The minister added that it was convenient for the US to blame Pakistan for its failure in pacifying Afghanistan, even though Washington had not pursued internal reconciliation seriously and instead the American fingers were on kill button.“The Trump administration has suspended strategic level dialogue with Pakistan, yet complains of failure of high level of communication which is bound to fail until backed up by consistent dialogue at the working level,” the minister said.Dastagir further told the assembly that it was time for courteous but ruthlessly candid dialogue between both the countries with everything on the table.The minister reminded the US of the sacrifices rendered by Pakistan’s armed forces and civilians and asked if we should put a price tag on it.He also asked the Afghan government and the US that should Pakistan also put a price tag for the three million Afghan refugees that it continues to host.Sharing his party’s line, he said the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) had started recalibration of Pakistan’s Defence and regional policy, and one of the new calibration was its recent relationship with Russia.“An opening has recently been achieved with Iran. The recent visit of chief of army staff has initiated a conversation that has been followed up by meetings of the two national security advisers.”While commenting about India, the minister stated that unremittingly hostile and anti-Pakistan stance taken by the current Indian government had drastically reduced the space for any advocacy of peace.“The escalation of Indian bombing on the Line of Control (LoC) has been matched with escalation in anti-Pakistan rhetoric which often descends to baiting and bashing,” he told the lawmakers.Meanwhile, right after the minister ended his statement, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and other parties termed the stance “confusing, flexible and vague.”PPP’s Naveed Qamar said the statement was harsh suggesting “we should tread carefully before raising the temperature.” He said the US could be irresponsible in the prevailing situation but Pakistan cannot afford to act the same way. “We also should know who is speaking for Pakistan, foreign office, civilian government or general headquarters,” he asked.PTI’s chief whip of the house Shireen Mazari said the statement had brought more confusion than clarity and asked why there was no rejection of the Indian army chief’s statement.She also castigated the government for hosting the US Acting Assistant Secretary of State Ambassador Alice Wells.“You are meeting a mid-ranking US official while it [US] has put you on a watchlist,” she said, adding GLOCs and ALOCs should be shut down as Pakistan was providing the facility for free.

News article:
MNA – Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan Raza Rabbani said Wed. that the US has been using Pakistan as a ‘scapegoat’ due to its recent losses in the Middle East, adding that Pakistan has paid a high price since then. Ali Larijani sat with the Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan Raza Rabbani on the sidelines of the 13th session of Parliamentary Union of the OIC Member States (PUIC) Conference on Wednesday in Tehran. During the meeting, the Pakistani official slammed Washington’s approach in using his country as a ‘scapegoat’ due to the Western country’s recent losses in the Middle East region, adding “we have paid a high price for this. The US even cut off its military assistance to us due to our vote in condemnation of Trump’s decision to relocate US embassy to Jerusalem.” He also touched upon the good relations between Iran and Pakistan, noting that the Wednesday visit was his second in the last six months with Iranian Parliament Speaker, Ali Larijani. He further expressed hope that the PUIC’s statement that would be released today at the end of the conference would further strengthen relations among the Muslim countries. Ali Larijani, for his part, noted the common enemies facing Iran and Pakistan, calling for stronger relations between the two sides in a bid to foil any disruptive plot hatched by the US. Larijani also called for development of economic and security cooperation with Pakistan, saying the rise in the level of cooperation in the past few months indicates the appropriate decisions made by the two countries.

News article:
Throughout the Cold War, Pakistan has been an instrumental US ally in south and central Asia. And the close relationship has continued in the years after. Pakistan has been key to the US efforts in Afghanistan since 2001, as the only reliable staging post in a region squeezed between Iran and China. In the service of this alliance, the US has supported Pakistan through thick and thin, through military dictatorships, through developing their own nuclear arsenal and through successive scandals involving Pakistan’s notorious ISI intelligence agency, and their dubious activities. Advertisement But in recent months, the ISI’s indiscretions and the tacit support they seem to have received from the military and political leadership of the country appear to have led the US to threaten to more or less cut ties with Pakistan. The transgressions which are motivating this move are Pakistan’s support for terrorist groups, and its duplicitous game of friend or foe it alternatively plays with the US and the Taliban. A recent point of contention has been the release from prison in Pakistan of Hafiz Saeed, the alleged mastermind behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Pakistan insists there is not enough evidence against him to try him in court, despite the fact that India has produced and handed over to the Pakistani authorities what they call “considerable evidence”. Saeed’s lawyers claim that no such evidence has been presented in court. This is very much in keeping with Pakistan’s history of supporting and protecting all manner of radical Islamist extremists. This historical policy has backfired spectacularly, as ordinary Pakistanis have suffered from radical Islamist terrorism more than any other intended target, but there is no denying that the ISI in particular has been keen to cultivate and protect Islamist terrorist agents to direct against India and Afghanistan. Yet Pakistan has also traditionally yielded when the US applied pressure on them for such activities. In normal circumstances, when the US would have called for an individual such as Saeed to be “prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law”, they would have followed suit. Not so today. There are a number of reasons for why this is so. The relationship between the US and Pakistan has never truly recovered after the bin Laden episode. It remains as inconceivable today as it was in 2011 that the leader of al-Qaida had lived safely, for so many years in hiding in Pakistan. And not just anywhere, but in a large compound in the large city of Abbottabad, less than a mile away from the Pakistan Military Academy. An alliance requires trust. And that trust has never been re-established. A buffer for Iranian influence Then, there is the fact that the US has largely withdrawn from Afghanistan. It retains no particular strategic interests in the region beyond, perhaps, containing Iran. But even so, Pakistan and Iran are natural opponents on national and sectarian grounds, so Pakistan would be expected to continue to serve as a buffer for Iranian influence with or without US support. So the US is keen to extricate itself from the complicated and damaging relation it has with Pakistan, and is currently repositioning itself as more favourable to India: a bigger economic partner, and a more reliable counter-weight to Chinese expansion in Asia. Pakistan no longer feels itself beholden to American desires. And the US does not care enough to flex its muscle and get its way. Azeem Ibrahim But the crucial part of this is Pakistan’s own relationship with China. Whereas for most of its post-independence history, Pakistan has relied on US support against India and Iran, currently, the country is drifting ever more clearly into the Chinese sphere of influence. China is investing massively into infrastructure in the country as part of their New Silk Road initiative so that their access to the Western markets avoids the contentious Straights of Malacca. This investment is responsible for driving most of the current economic growth in Pakistan, as well as the increasing conditions ordinary Pakistanis are seeing along the Chinese-built economic corridor. The entire political and military establishment are also behind these new developments. In other words, the US is happy to retreat from Pakistan, and Pakistan is happy to move on to a closer relationship with China. The case of Hafiz Saeed may become emblematic of this shift. The rational thing to do about this case would be to hand him over to a court in a respected independent country agreeable to all parties, or maybe something like the ICC. If he were found not-guilty, that would vindicate Pakistan’s long standing claim that India is accusing it of terrorism without any basis. If he were found guilty, Pakistan would be confirmed as a state-sponsor of terror. But of course, no such thing will happen. Pakistan no longer feels itself beholden to American desires. And the US does not care enough to flex its muscle and get its way. It seems the two countries are having an amicable enough parting of ways. And the victims of Mumbai will be denied justice in the process.

News article:
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has given new timeline to both Pakistan and India for filing another round of memorials in the case of convicted Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav, sources have revealed to The Express Tribune.Sources revealed that the ICJ has set April 17 for India to file another memorial, while Pakistan will have to submit a counter memorial by July 17.In view of the timeline, they also informed that there is little chance that the hearing of the case will resume in 2018, adding that the two-month summer vacations of ICJ judges will start in August, and when it ended, the court will take up cases that have already been fixed before it.Earlier, New Delhi sought time to file an additional memorial at the ICJ. Legal experts are, however, wondering why India is trying to unnecessarily drag the matter.While submitting a 1,700-page counter memorial in the ICJ on December 13 last year, Pakistan rejected the Indian objection of not giving consular access to Jadhav, saying the provision of such access under the Vienna Convention is only for legitimate visitors, and not spies.Pakistan said that since India did not deny that Jadhav was travelling with an assumed Muslim name, they have no case to plead.India has repeatedly sought consular access to Jadhav, but Pakistan has turned down its requests, citing a bilateral accord that does not permit such access to spies.However, on December 25, Islamabad allowed Jadhav’s mother and wife to meet with him on purely humanitarian grounds.It was learnt that the government has also sought legal assistance from two top lawyers of the country. The initial memorial was drafted by Khawar Qureshi.According to sources, Pakistan stated in the memorial that India did not explain how a serving naval commander, operating under India’s spy agency – Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) – was travelling under an assumed name. This leads to only one conclusion, that India seeks consular access to the information he [Jadhav] had gathered, it added.It said since Jadhav was on active duty, it is obvious that he was a spy sent on a special mission.“Only a state that adheres to legitimate actions can request the court to intervene in a matter between two states. A state which does not come with clean hands cannot get any relief,” Pakistan contended.Pakistan further said that sending Jadhav for espionage and funding terrorist activities were some of the reasons that disentitle India from invoking jurisdiction of the ICJ.Sources said Pakistan also highlighted constant violations of human rights by India in occupied Kashmir. It said India is a habitual violator of human rights and has not honoured the UN resolutions on Kashmir.“Giving false identity to Kulbhushan, sending him for espionage and funding of terrorists activities are all some of the reasons which disentitle India from invoking the jurisdiction of the ICJ,” said the counter memorial according to a source. The ICJ will decide the schedule of hearing within 15 days.On September 13 last year, India submitted a 22-page memorandum wherein it objected to Jadhav being tried by a military court in Pakistan.The sources said India contended that Jadhav’s trial should have been conducted by a civilian court and that Pakistan was bound to give him consular access.The federal government has already appointed former chief justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani as an ad hoc judge for the case at The Hague.Legal experts are urging all stakeholders to increase coordination in devising the final draft of the memorandum.The ICJ on May 18 last year halted the execution of Jadhav, who was sentenced to death by a military court on April 10 after being convicted on charges of terrorism and espionage.Jadhav alias Hussain Mubarak Patel was apprehended on March 3, 2016, after he illegally crossed into Pakistan via Iran border.

News article:
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has given new timeline to both Pakistan and India for filing another round of memorials in the case of convicted Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav, sources have revealed to The Express Tribune.Sources revealed that the ICJ has set April 17 for India to file another memorial, while Pakistan will have to submit a counter memorial by July 17.In view of the timeline, they also informed that there is little chance that the hearing of the case will resume in 2018, adding that the two-month summer vacations of ICJ judges will start in August, and when it ended, the court will take up cases that have already been fixed before it.Earlier, New Delhi sought time to file an additional memorial at the ICJ. Legal experts are, however, wondering why India is trying to unnecessarily drag the matter.While submitting a 1,700-page counter memorial in the ICJ on December 13 last year, Pakistan rejected the Indian objection of not giving consular access to Jadhav, saying the provision of such access under the Vienna Convention is only for legitimate visitors, and not spies.Pakistan said that since India did not deny that Jadhav was travelling with an assumed Muslim name, they have no case to plead.India has repeatedly sought consular access to Jadhav, but Pakistan has turned down its requests, citing a bilateral accord that does not permit such access to spies.However, on December 25, Islamabad allowed Jadhav’s mother and wife to meet with him on purely humanitarian grounds.It was learnt that the government has also sought legal assistance from two top lawyers of the country. The initial memorial was drafted by Khawar Qureshi.According to sources, Pakistan stated in the memorial that India did not explain how a serving naval commander, operating under India’s spy agency – Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) – was travelling under an assumed name. This leads to only one conclusion, that India seeks consular access to the information he [Jadhav] had gathered, it added.It said since Jadhav was on active duty, it is obvious that he was a spy sent on a special mission.“Only a state that adheres to legitimate actions can request the court to intervene in a matter between two states. A state which does not come with clean hands cannot get any relief,” Pakistan contended.Pakistan further said that sending Jadhav for espionage and funding terrorist activities were some of the reasons that disentitle India from invoking jurisdiction of the ICJ.Sources said Pakistan also highlighted constant violations of human rights by India in occupied Kashmir. It said India is a habitual violator of human rights and has not honoured the UN resolutions on Kashmir.“Giving false identity to Kulbhushan, sending him for espionage and funding of terrorists activities are all some of the reasons which disentitle India from invoking the jurisdiction of the ICJ,” said the counter memorial according to a source. The ICJ will decide the schedule of hearing within 15 days.On September 13 last year, India submitted a 22-page memorandum wherein it objected to Jadhav being tried by a military court in Pakistan.The sources said India contended that Jadhav’s trial should have been conducted by a civilian court and that Pakistan was bound to give him consular access.The federal government has already appointed former chief justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani as an ad hoc judge for the case at The Hague.Legal experts are urging all stakeholders to increase coordination in devising the final draft of the memorandum.The ICJ on May 18 last year halted the execution of Jadhav, who was sentenced to death by a military court on April 10 after being convicted on charges of terrorism and espionage.Jadhav alias Hussain Mubarak Patel was apprehended on March 3, 2016, after he illegally crossed into Pakistan via Iran border.

News article:
As president, Donald Trump has steered a new course in the Middle East Donald Trump has spent much of his first year as president of the United States seeking to undo the legacy of his predecessor, Barack Obama. The volatile Middle East is one of the many areas where Trump has broken with US policy and precedent. On Wednesday, Trump overturned decades of US policy by announcing that Washington recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and setting in motion plans to move the embassy there from Tel Aviv. Here is a look at some of the hot button issues in the Middle East and the new course being steered by Trump: - Israel and the Palestinians - Trump has instituted a policy of unwavering support for Israel after a period of strained relations between Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The last days of the Obama administration included an extraordinary US refusal at the United Nations to block a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlement construction. Netanyahu welcomed Trump's November 2016 election saying he was a "true friend of the State of Israel." Since then, Trump has appointed a US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, known for his support for settlement activity, and ordered the withdrawal of US support for UNESCO, citing anti-Israel bias. Trump has tasked his son-in-law Jared Kushner, a senior adviser, with relaunching moribund peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. But he has been lukewarm about a Palestinian state and angered Palestinian leaders earlier this year with a threat -- since withdrawn -- to close the Palestine Liberation Organization mission in Washington. - Iran - Trump considers Iran to be the principal threat to US interests in the Middle East and has frequently condemned the Islamic Republic for what he sees as its "destabilizing" influence in Yemen, Syria and Lebanon. Trump has been a relentless critic of the Iran nuclear deal signed in 2015 and has repeatedly threatened to scrap the agreement intended to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. The president's tough stance on Iran has earned praise from Netanyahu and from Saudi Arabia, the Islamic Republic's chief regional rival. - Saudi Arabia, Egypt - Trump has strengthened ties with Saudi Arabia and his first official visit abroad as president was to the oil-rich monarchy, where he was received with pomp and circumstance. Trump threw his support behind the anti-corruption crackdown launched by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Saudi actions against Qatar, which Riyadh accuses of cooperating with Tehran. Relations with another Middle East powerhouse -- Egypt -- have also entered a new era under Trump. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was persona non grata under Obama and the United States cut off some military aid because of the bloody crackdown on supporters of the former president. But Trump welcomed Sisi to the White House in April and proclaimed his "strong backing" for the Egyptian leader. - Syria - Trump frequently accused Obama of failing to stand up to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and in April he ordered the first US military strike on Syrian troops since the civil war began in that country. Dozens of US missiles were fired at a Syrian air base in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack on a rebel town which left 87 people dead. The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria and the Pentagon said Tuesday that they will stay "as long as we need" to prevent a return of the Islamic State group. Trump also reinforced the US military contingent in Afghanistan, a move at odds with Obama's efforts to withdraw US troops from conflict zones abroad.

News article:
Talking to IRNA on Saturday, Abhimanyu Kohar, who is the founder of a group called Yuva Kranti Organization which advocates new paradigms for Indian youth in political and social arenas said that the Zionist lobby in the United States has grown more powerful.Noting that earlier governments in the United States too had sought to transfer the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, he said now it is Trump who acts courageously to expose the dual American standard to the whole world.He said that the Zionist regime lobby in the United States has also tried to cancel the nuclear deal with Iran. And all these happen because the Zionist regime fears Hezbollah, Iran, and the Palestinian people.He added that “one of America's objectives in moving its embassy to Jerusalem is to provoke Muslims. The ISIS terrorist group has now been destroyed by the efforts of the Iraqi and Syrian armies and the Iranian aid. But the United States wants to expand extremist Wahhabi ideas in the region thus provokes Muslims to react.”On the consequences of the US decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem, the Indian political activist stressed that one results of this US decision is the elimination of talks with Palestine. While the US backed Zionist politicians claim they want to negotiate, but such actions will undermine the negotiation process.“If the United States really is a democratic country, they should respect the sentiments of the Palestinian people. The Palestinian issue is not a religious issue, but a humanistic problem. Human rights in Palestine have been ignored,” he stressed.He further noted, “People around the world support Palestine in a peaceful manner. But the Zionist regime is using violence against oppressed Palestinians. The people of the world should give the message to the United States that they support the Palestinians and press the United States and Zionist regime to comply with UN resolutions.”On Indian government and Indian media positions against Palestine, Kohar said, 'The Indian government has said that its policy will not be affected by the third country. The Indian foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj in the last Non-Alignment meeting has said that India is concerned about the situation in Palestine.However, he noted that in recent years, the Zionist regime-Wahhabi lobby has infiltrated India's media, so many of Indian media would refrain from explicitly voicing support to Palestine. The Indian government should continue to support the Palestinian people.Kohar concluded, 'The Palestinians must attain their rights, and all the countries must support the Palestinian people.'Ignoring the United Nations Security Council Resolution No. 478 dated 1980, Trump on Wednesday said in a press conference that the fact that Tel Aviv was currently used as the Zionist regime capital was 'illegal' and said, 'Time is ripe to recognize Quds as Israel capital.'He also ordered the US foreign ministry to make necessary preparations to relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to al-Quds.His decision was met by wide protest on the part of both governments and people of many world countries, even US allies.267**1424Follow us on Tweeter@ IrnaEnglish

News article:
President Donald Trump has laid out plans for the U.S. to challenge Russia and China's growing influence on the world stage; rein in North Korea and Iran's defiance of the West; and destroy what's left of the Islamic State militant group (ISIS). Trump announced Monday his new national security strategy, a document produced by every U.S. leader since former President Ronald Reagan as mandated by Congress in 1986. Trump's highly anticipated report, which was shared by the White House, promised an "America First" strategy that identified other leading world powers, authoritarian states opposed to the West and the global threat of jihadi organizations as the foremost threats to the U.S. Related: U.S. War With Russia and China More Likely as World Power Shifts From West to East, NATO Says "China and Russia challenge American power, influence and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity. They are determined to make economies less free and less fair, to grow their militaries, and to control information and data to repress their societies and expand their influence," Trump wrote in his first such report as president. "At the same time, the dictatorships of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Islamic Republic of Iran are determined to destabilize regions, threaten Americans and our allies, and brutalize their own people. Transnational threat groups, from jihadist terrorists to transnational criminal organizations, are actively trying to harm Americans," he wrote. In the 55-page document, Trump did not specifically reference U.S. allegations that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election in his favor, but did charge Moscow with "using information tools in an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of democracies." When Trump entered office in January, he was widely considered to be a political ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, but their relationship has been strained as their nations diverged on major issues such as the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Ukraine. Recent reports that the CIA provided the Kremlin with crucial intelligence to stop a jihadi attack in St. Petersburg, and cautious cooperation between the U.S. and Russia in battling ISIS in Syria have produced prospects for an improved relationship, but the Trump administration has remained deeply suspicious of Russia's growing military power and diplomatic influence that challenges Western dominance in crucial areas such as Europe and the Middle East. Trump criticized Russian and Chinese initiatives to develop "advanced weapons and capabilities that could threaten our critical infrastructure and our command and control architecture" and "to reassert their influence regionally and globally." In addition to targeting China's own growing military and political power, Trump censured Beijing for stealing "U.S. intellectual property valued at hundreds of billions of dollars," while noting its advances in sophisticated artificial intelligence programs and investment in infrastructure across the globe. The report singled out the "rogue regime" of North Korea and "evil dictatorship" of Iran, both of which occupied the State Department's list of State Sponsors of Terrorism as of November. Trump escalated the U.S.-led campaign to disarm North Korea's nuclear and ballistic weapons arsenal, which has grown substantially in power under young supreme leader Kim Jong Un, and threatened to do so by force. Trump also decertified a 2015 historic nuclear deal with Iran and has led efforts to isolate Tehran diplomatically over accusations it sponsored militant groups across the Middle East. Trump pledged to deploy "a layered missile defense system focused on North Korea and Iran to defend our homeland against missile attacks." Both countries have denied wanting to target the U.S. and have compared Trump's stance toward their respective nations to that of former President George W. Bush in the days leading up to the Iraq War. Trump's charges against Russia and Iran came in spite of the fact that all three were involved in the fight against ISIS, which saw significant losses in the past year. In separate offensives, a Russia and Iran-backed campaign and a U.S.-led campaign largely defeated the militants in Syria, while forces supported by both the U.S. and Iran ousted the jihadis from the vast majority of Iraq. Russia, Iran, Iraq and Syria have all declared victory over the group in past weeks, but their forces, as well as the U.S., continue bombing the group in shrinking pockets of territory. Despite ISIS's massive territorial defeats, attacks conducted in the name of the group have continued worldwide. New York City experienced its first ISIS-inspired attack in October, the deadliest to hit the city since 9/11, and a second earlier this month, which injured several people, including the perpetrator. Authorities said the suspect in the pipe-bomb blast, which only seriously hurt the attacker himself, may have gotten instructions to build the device online, highlighting the continued threat of ISIS's virtual caliphate, which has provided instructions to would-be jihadis to strike targets around the world.

News article:
US President Donald Trump had harsh words for Iran on Tuesday, as he delivered a speech in Washington, DC unveiling his “America First” national security strategy. “To counter Iran and block its path to a nuclear weapon, I sanctioned the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) for its support of terrorism,” Trump said. “I declined to certify the Iran deal to Congress.” The president also said that “the Gulf states and other Muslim-majority nations” had “joined together to fight radical Islamic ideology and terrorist financing” following his trip to the Middle East earlier this year. Trump outlined the four pillars undergirding his strategy as the protection of the American homeland and its borders, promoting American economic prosperity, boosting spending on the US military and ending the defense budget sequester, and advancing American influence and values abroad. Related coverage DePaul University Student Government Denounces Campus Antisemitism The Student Government Association (SGA) of DePaul University issued a statement earlier this month denouncing antisemitism. "We as the DePaul Student... “Any nation that trades away its prosperity for security will end up losing both,” Trump said. One former senior official in the George W. Bush administration observed that Trump was far less sanguine than his predecessor on the question of alliances with other nations. “President Trump obviously sees a Hobbesian world with enormous challenges to the United States, and the Strategy sees countries like China, Iran, and Russia as rivals and opponents not partners,” Elliott Abrams — who served as deputy assistant to the president and deputy national security adviser in the George W. Bush administration — told The Algemeiner on Monday. “Accordingly it calls for an increase in American military strength,” Abrams said. “That is a welcome change from the Obama approach to world affairs.” On the Middle East, Trump’s National Security Strategy echoes some of the skepticism of the Bush administration regarding the centrality of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute to the myriad conflicts and human rights outrages across the region. In 2006, Bush’s National Security Strategy declared, “Terrorism is not simply a result of Israeli-Palestinian issues. Al-Qaeda plotting for the September 11 attacks began in the 1990s, during an active period in the peace process.” Trump’s strategy document goes even further, arguing, “For generations the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians has been understood as the prime irritant preventing peace and prosperity in the region. Today, the threats from jihadist terrorist organizations and the threat from Iran are creating the realization that Israel is not the cause of the region’s problems.” “States have increasingly found common interests with Israel in confronting common threats,” the National Security Strategy document highlighted. Overall, the strategy indicates that the Trump administration will work with national governments and regional bodies in the Middle East to counter Islamist terrorism and growing Iranian political and military influence. “Whenever possible, we will encourage gradual reforms,” the strategy said. “We will support efforts to counter violent ideologies and increase respect for the dignity of individuals. We remain committed to helping our partners achieve a stable and prosperous region, including through a strong and integrated Gulf Cooperation Council. We will strengthen our long-term strategic partnership with Iraq as an independent state. We will seek a settlement to the Syrian civil war that sets the conditions for refugees to return home and rebuild their lives in safe.” The document continued: “We will work with partners to deny the Iranian regime all paths to a nuclear weapon and neutralize Iranian malign influence. We remain committed to helping facilitate a comprehensive peace agreement that is acceptable to both Israelis and Palestinians.” The new national security strategy identifies Russia and China as threats to US prosperity, saying that both countries are “developing advanced weapons and capabilities that could threaten our critical infrastructure and our command and control architecture.” Nevertheless, in his speech, Trump presented the US and Russia as allies in the war againt Islamist terror groups. The president warmly mentioned a phone call he received from Russian leader Vladimir Putin thanking the US for supplying intelligence that thwarted a major terrorist outrage in the city of St. Petersburg. “That’s a great thing,” Trump stressed. “That’s the way it’s supposed to work.”

News article:
Donald Trump, who had no experience in politics, became the president of the United States with his famous motto "America first." While Trump and his aides try to "make America great again," unconsciously, they have sped up the decline of American hegemony due to their unilateral foreign policy understanding and exclusionary political discourse. The U.S. now is notorious not only in the eyes of its challengers, but also in the eyes of its long-time allies and friends. Trump's America has begun to alienate almost all its partners, from the narrowest circle to the widest one, from Anglo-Saxon friends to European partners, from Latin American neighbors to Asian rivals, from Sub-Sahara to North Africa. Trump's America contradicts its closest ally, the United Kingdom. The latest two cases, in which the Trump administration contradicted the May government, are Trump's proclamation on Jerusalem and retweeting inflammatory videos shared by a British ultra-nationalist politician. Similar to almost all European countries, the U.K. government also rejected Trump's decision on Jerusalem. In her official statement, British Prime Minister Theresa May pointed out that her government disagrees with Trump's decision. Similarly, all sides of the House of Commons condemned the decision. Moreover, Prime Minister May denounced President Trump for sharing abusive and threatening videos posted by Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, a far-right political party in the U.K. Trump, who is against the global free trade order established by Pax Americana, declared the end of the era of multinational trade agreements. As soon as he came to power, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TTP). As a result, the 11 Pacific Rim countries, which had total trade of $350 billion last year, decided to resurrect the partnership and start free trade. Trump's America initiated a comprehensive trade war with European countries. Trump promised to scrap the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Nevertheless, he claimed that it would limit imports of steel and aluminum to protect domestic companies. The European Union will retaliate against any sanctions imposed by the U.S. against European companies. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had to declare that the EU's mood "is increasingly combative" on the topic of international trade. Furthermore, 25 EU member states signed a defense cooperation agreement and decided to establish Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), which will decrease their dependence on NATO, and as a result their dependence on the U.S. Latin American countries, which are considered as the "near abroad" of the U.S. since the early years of the 19th century, consistently complain about threats from the U.S. Similarly, most Asian countries have many political and economic divergences with Trump's America. Trump even attempted to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump's America otherizes Islamic civilization and Muslims worldwide, including American and European Muslims, who are citizens of Western countries. Trump's anti-Islamic and anti-immigration rhetoric damages American global perception. In particular, after the Jerusalem decision, it would not be surprising if anti-Americanism skyrockets in Muslim countries. Although it will satisfy the Israeli government and his constituency, the unpopularity of Trump's America is growing in the Muslim world. Two developments last Monday punctuated America's increasing isolation. The first was the vote on a resolution demanding the rejection of Trump's decision on Jerusalem. All 14 members of the 15-member U.N. Security Council, including the staunchest U.S. allies such as the U.K., voted for the resolution. The U.S. was alone. The second was the announcement of the new national security strategy. Trump declared global powers such as Russia and China, middle states such as Iran and North Korea and non-state actors as multiple threats challenging U.S. interests. While the strategy aims to fight these multiple challenges, it rejects multiple cooperation initiatives such as multiple free trade agreements. As a result, due to its unilateral and irresponsible foreign policy behavior and conflictual political discourse, Trump's America instigated the rise of anti-Americanism even in friendly countries such as the U.K., Germany, Mexico and Turkey. Most observers from both the U.S. and other Western circles claim that Trump's strategy is not sustainable and that it will turn out to be self-destructive. Soon to be a lone hegemon, Trump's America is seen as an unreliable partner by most of its partners and allies. Trump's unpredictable and domestically driven foreign policy discourse confuses not only foreign governments but also most of the American public.

News article:
Ever encounter a panhandler, and, motivated by kindness, hand over a dollar? Only to have the beggar berate you for not giving more? That’s the situation the United States finds itself in with the United Nations. President Trump’s not-so-subtle threat to remember which nations voted to condemn his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital was the ultimate case of speaking truth to power. The largest – by far – donor to the United Nations, and a provider of foreign aid to dozens of other U.N. member states, America holds a unique, though decidedly not privileged position in the so-called world body. Yet for decades, it has been stymied by its rivals (China and Russia), by rogue regimes (Iran), and by a U.N. leadership that views America as a source of demonic, not democratic values. Like a spoiled child who complains its allowance has not be paid on time, recipients of U.S. aid forget that those dollars are largesse, not earned income. Well and good. But why, then, should the U.S. continue to ante up 22 percent of the U.N.’s budget, and fully 28 percent of its peacekeeping effort? When Ambassador Nikki Haley said the U.S. would be “taking names,” and Trump said “we’ll be watching,” liberal news outlets reacted as if a Mafia chieftain had just set the price for a kidnapping victim’s release. Why the moral outrage? We know our friends. Guatemala, Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo joined the U.S. voting against the resolution of condemnation. Another 35 countries, including our closest neighbors, Mexico and Canada, as well as Argentina, Australia, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Romania, abstained. And now we know who cannot depend on. Egypt, to whom we provide $1.6 billion in aid each year, voted against the U.S. Turkey, which gets $155 million, went against us, with its president Recep Tayyip Erdogan boldly declaring, “What is the cradle of democracy doing? They are looking for people they can buy with their dollars.” Fine, Mr. President, fine. Like a spoiled child who complains its allowance has not been paid on time, recipients of U.S. aid forget that those dollars are largesse, not earned income. News outlets like Sky News in the United Kingdom – which voted to condemn Trump’s move – had on-air apoplexy about the president’s statement. Of course, the U.N. is a toothless, almost furless tiger. Its resolutions of outrage and disapproval count for precisely nothing. Trump is not the first president to speak aloud about the ingratitude of the U.N. He may, however, be the first to do something about it.

News article:
Donald Trump’s newly announced national security strategy has prompted a Russian scramble to defend Russian interests, with the Kremlin announcing the White House’s endorsement of a “peace through strength” principle a confrontational bid that undermines hopes for a breakthrough in US-Russian relations. It has also triggered an Iranian escalation, with the first response coming in Yemen where the Houthi rebels fired a ballistic missile into inhabited areas south of the Saudi capital Riyadh. The Trump administration also inflamed a third front omitted by the national security strategy, when the US president detonated a bombshell by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, infuriating and embarrassing Arab and Muslim friends and allies of the United States. The US envoy to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, took the crisis to the next level by deploying vetoing a Security Council draft resolution rejecting Washington’s Jerusalem move and calling for its withdrawal. The resolution was backed by all other 14 Security Council members, prompting Haley to vow that her country would remember this “insult”. When Arab and Muslim nations put forward a similar resolution at the General Assembly, Haley threatened that Washington was “taking names” and watching which countries would vote which way. In an unprecedented move in the history of the UN, the US President threatened to cut off aid from countries voting in favor of the resolution, saying: “Let them vote against us…We’ll save a lot. We don’t care. But this isn’t like it used to be where they could vote against you and then you pay them hundreds of millions of dollars”. Donald Trump’s statements meant to coerce American aid recipients to accept his dictates are humiliating. Furthermore, they have no value vis-a-vis the US’ strategic partners that do not need US aid, such as Saudi Arabia, whose king Salman bin Abdulaziz was meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on the day of the vote to show Riyadh’s support for Palestinian rights. Indeed, how does the Trump administration intend to “punish” the Saudi, Emirati, and Egyptian votes in favor of the UN General Assembly resolution, in light of the important strategic relations between these countries and Washington? Advertisement There are a lot of signs of immature policies in the conduct of the Trump administration at the UN, where every member state is fully entitled to vote in any way it suits it. This is a shaming, dictating, bullying, and coercing strategy that does not serve US long-term interests, not to mention that it violates the most basic principles of democracy and respect for different views. Worst of all, this strategy upends international legitimacy and the norms governing international relations, regardless of whether or not the scrutiny of a sovereign decision by way of a Security Council resolution was a political mistake or an affront against the US. When Egypt, the only current Arab member of the Security Council, put forward a draft resolution calling on the US to withdraw its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and the transfer of the US embassy there, it wanted to reaffirm previous UN Security Council resolutions that demand no change in the status of Jerusalem except through negotiations between the two parties. Trump’s measures that sought to completely alter this facet of US foreign policy therefore appear arbitrary, even in the context of US grand strategy and national security. The reason, according to one observer close to the Trump administration, is that Trump is picking and choosing from the demands of three rival camps in his administration fighting to shape his final decisions, and as a result, the implementation of many of these decisions is effectively on hold. According to the same source, the first camp considers China to be the foremost long-term challenge for US interests, followed by Iran and Turkey in the near term. The proponents of this view want the administration to bolster Russia, even if this requires compromises such as on accepting Bashar al-Assad’s survival in power in Syria. For this camp, China’s challenge includes the North Korean challenge, yet both are of a long-term nature. Meanwhile, Iran, Turkey, Qatar, and Hezbollah are seen as challenges of a near-term nature. The mantra of this camp, dominated by alt-right voices such as Steve Bannon, is the necessity of eliminating radical Islamic terror, in both its Sunni and Shia iterations. Advertisement The second camp, led by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and national security adviser H. R. McMaster, accepts the first camp’s view regarding the need for a strategic alliance with Gulf countries against Islamic radicalism, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, through firm policies and reforms. This camp wants to preserve the cohesion of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), but insists that Qatar’s policies deviate from the Gulf line and threaten Gulf unity. This camp considers Iran a major problem in Iraq and Syria, while Lebanon for them has already fallen “militarily and politically,” as the source put it. Regarding Russia, this camp does not trust Putin and does not believe he would abandon Iran, and calls for further pressure on Russia, Iran, and Assad. The third camp in the Trump administration favors the status quo. It sees in former President Barack Obama’s approach to Iran an example to be emulated, and therefore, does not see Iran as a threat. This camp is led by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who sometimes gets support from Defense Secretary James Mattis, for example with regard to their view that North Korea’s threat to US interests should be prioritized. Tillerson does not see the value of a strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

On April 7 , however, he stunned even many of his supporters by authorizing the launching of missile strikes on an airbase of the Syrian Army after an alleged chemical attack in the town of Khan Shaykhun. The perpetrators of the attack have still not been identified by a UN investigation, however the US president and his ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley immediately held Syrian president Bashar al-Assad responsible. While the missile attack caused many of his own supporters to begin doubting the sincerity of his non-interventionist promises, the attack received widespread approval in the American media, with many prominent commentators identifying it as the point at which he, "became presidential." Iran Nuclear Agreement Having condemned as a candidate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, agreed between the United States, Great Britain, France, Russia, China, Germany and Iran to suspend elements of the latter's nuclear program, as president, Mr. Trump set about indicating that he was intending to sink the agreement altogether and re-impose sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Despite the International Atomic Energy Agency's repeated certifications that Iran is complying with the terms of the agreement, President Trump has persisted in claiming the Islamic Republic is not complying with "the spirit of the agreement." His decertification of Iranian compliance with the JCPOA and his insistence that Congress reimpose sanctions within 60 days or he will, drew hostile responses even from close US allies. Federica Mogherini, the EU's foreign policy chief flatly rejected the US' ability to sink the agreement, saying that no single country could do so. She also reiterated that the Agreement could not be renegotiated. The German Foreign Minister also ominously warned that the US scuttling of the deal could have profound geopolitical consequences globally, hinting that EU states would pursue closer economic relations with Russia and China rather than go along with a renewed US sanctions regime against Iran. North Korean Crisis Donald Trump's first appearance at the United Nations General Assembly set the stage for an unprecedented exchange of insults between the US and the North Korean leadership.

News article:
Paris (AFP) - From the inauguration of US President Donald Trump to the exodus of Rohingyas from Myanmar, here are 12 events that marked 2017. - A year of Trump - On January 20 Republican billionaire Donald Trump, 70, is inaugurated as US president, vowing: "America first." Suspicions of collusion between his election campaign and Russia dog the start of his term. Trump progressively unpicks the achievements of his Democrat predecessor, Barack Obama. He pulls out of international agreements on climate, free trade, immigration and UNESCO. On December 6, in another break with the previous administration, Trump creates shockwaves when he recognises Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a move largely rejected in a UN vote. On December 20 he seals his first major reform, signing long-awaited tax cuts into law. - Brexit under way - On March 29 London launches the process to quit the European Union, as voted in a referendum nine months earlier. In a snap general election on June 8 Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives suffer a major setback and lose their majority. Brussels and London agree on divorce terms on December 8. - France: political earthquake - Pro-EU centrist Emmanuel Macron, 39, wins a resounding victory over far-right rival Marine Le Pen in France's presidential election on May 7. His new En Marche (One the Move) movement drives the two biggest parties -- the Socialists and Republicans -- from the Elysee Palace for the first time. - Middle East: boiling point - Saudi Arabia and its allies sever diplomatic ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it supporting "terrorists" and of being too close to Iran. Then on November 4 Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri announces from the Saudi capital that he is resigning, citing Iran's "grip" on his country. He later backtracks. Saudi Arabia also accuses rebels in Yemen of receiving support from Iran, which denies the accusation. The UN describes Yemen's humanitarian situation as the worst in the world in 2017. Story continues - Venezuela: economic disaster - On July 30 Venezuela's Constituent Assembly -- whose legitimacy is disputed by the opposition and abroad -- is elected after four months of deadly protests against socialist President Nicolas Maduro. With wide-ranging powers, it dismisses in early August Attorney General Luisa Ortega, one of Maduro's top critics. It then takes over the opposition-dominated Congress. Crippled by plummeting oil prices, the country is considered to be in "selective default" by ratings agencies. - North Korea: escalation - The reclusive regime conducts its sixth and largest nuclear test on September 3. On November 29 leader Kim Jong-Un says a "state nuclear force" has been completed with the test of a long-range missile able to deliver a nuclear warhead anywhere in the United States. Washington threatens to "utterly destroy" the regime "if war comes". On December 22 the UN Security Council imposes new sanctions against North Korea that restrict vital oil supplies. - Myanmar's Rohingyas: 'genocide' - On August 25 the military in Buddhist-majority Myanmar launches a crackdown on Rohingyas after militants from the stateless Muslim minority ambush security forces. Nearly 655,000 Rohingyas find refuge in Bangladesh. The United States denounces "ethnic cleansing" while the UN speaks of "elements of genocide". - Catalonia: autonomy suspended - Spain's wealthy northeastern Catalonia region holds a referendum for independence on October 1 that is deemed illegal by the central government. Madrid moves to assert control but Catalan lawmakers vote on October 27 to declare independence. Madrid dismisses Catalonia's government and suspends its autonomy, also calling regional elections. Deposed regional president Carles Puigdemont, charged with sedition and rebellion, takes refuge in Belgium. On December 21 three pro-independence parties defeat the central government in the elections. However, the centrist, anti-independence Ciudadanos party gets the best individual result. - The Weinstein scandal - On October 5 the New York Times publishes a bombshell investigative report accusing Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, 65, of sexual harassment over decades. Similar allegations have since been levelled at a long list of personalities in film, television, journalism and politics around the world. - Zimbabwe: Mugabe falls - Zimbabwe's veteran President Robert Mugabe, 93, resigns on November 21 following 37 years of rule and after being abandoned by the military and his own party. - IS defeated, not wiped out - Iraq on December 9 declares victory in its war to expel the Islamic State group but experts warn that jihadists remain a threat. They have also lost most of their territory in Syria. Numerous deadly attacks around the world over the year, including in Afghanistan, Britain, Egypt and Somalia, are claimed by or blamed on the group or others linked to Al-Qaeda. - Climate: record disasters - The year in which Trump decides, on June 1, to leave the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord is marked by a series of natural disasters, including record-breaking hurricanes, earthquakes and devastating fires that affect several countries. It is set to be one of the three warmest years ever recorded.

News article:
The world, to say nothing of two-thirds of the people in this country, deplores Donald Trump. It rejects his racist, sexist rhetoric, his wild and foolish pronouncements, his arrogance, his abundant manifestations of malignant narcissism. The world deplores his withdrawal from the Paris Accord, his rejection of the painstakingly negotiated Iran nuclear agreement, and now his decision–opposed by his leading advisors (except for his son-in-law Jared Kushner)–to recognize, as no other nation save the occupying power Israel ever has, occupied Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The recent UN General Assembly vote implicitly condemning Trump’s decision – which so infuriated the clueless US UN ambassador, Nikki Haley – was a harsh rebuke to Trump. But did it not reflect a broader repudiation of the contemporary USA? A recent Pew poll, taken before the Jerusalem announcement, showed that only 49 percent of the world’s people now see the U.S. favorably. Trump argues validly that he has simply made official what has been US policy since 1995, when Congress, pressured by the Israel Lobby, passed the ‘Jerusalem Embassy Act.’ The move was politically unproblematic within the US; at the time nearly 50 percent of US residents told pollsters they believed that “God gave Israel to the Jews.” The mix of Lobby influence, Christian Evangelical credence to biblical myth (Genesis 12:3), general historical ignorance and racist indifference to the plight of a cruelly oppressed and humiliated people produced that vote (of 374 to 37 in the House and 93 to 5 in the Senate). That is to say: this preposterous recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the whole of Jerusalem, including – as it necessarily does – an open attack on Palestinian rights, is not merely another eccentric work of Trump. It is a natural emanation of US imperialist culture. The Obama presidency showed how a leader continuing and expanding on his predecessor’s assault on the Middle East could maintain high domestic ratings; enjoy the respect of the leaders of allied states, such as the UK, France and Germany; and if we can believe the polls even receive a generally positive reception from the world’s people. But the Trump presidency shows how a leader staying his predecessors’ course on Afghanistan, Iraq and even to a considerable extent Syria (these involvements, and US knee-jerk support for Israel, being the key source of global hatred for the US) can only retain the support of one-third of the US population. This is due to his manifest ignorance, bigotry and general buffoonery. It shows too that there are limits to western allies’ deference. Angela Merkel, Theresa May and Emmanuel Marcon have all had harsh words for Trump on climate, Iran, trade, immigration, Islam, Korea threats, and now Jerusalem. This is good. Fractures in the unholy alliance called NATO, the anti-Russian alliance which successive US administrations have sought to expand, and which under Trump’s watch has now included Montenegro, can only be positive. Let Washington’s current imperialist partners conclude that the US cannot lead the world in a direction that advantages them. Let them conclude that the preposterous Jerusalem decision, which can only produce more violence, is the last straw. Let the European masses realize that Europe’s refugee crisis is the fruit of US interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya that made no sense. Let them realize that Washington’s drive to include Ukraine in NATO through the February 2014 putsch led to Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and the US-mandated sanctions on Russia damaging European economies.

News article:
Photo illustration by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images The United States was about 48 hours into the new year and, for a sweet, brief moment, it seemed like the political news cycle would be uncoupled from the presidential Twitter feed. But, alas, just two days into 2018, President Donald Trump, itching for controversy following a relatively quiet holiday break, sent off a barrage of missives with far-reaching international and domestic implications. Here’s a round-up of president’s Twitter feed from the first Tuesday of the year. 363 days to go. He Attacked Former Hillary Clinton Aide Huma Abedin Crooked Hillary Clinton’s top aid, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018 Advertisement Trump renewed his attacks against former 2016 presidential election rival Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, calling for one of her top aides, Huma Abedin, to be jailed. His message ― which also included a hit at what he called the “deep state Justice Department” ― apparently referenced emails sent by Abedin that were released by the State Department on Friday. Trump has continued to attack Clinton and her team more than a year after he was elected president. Read more here. He Called Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man” And Said He Had A “Much Bigger” Nuclear Button North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2018 Trump taunted Kim Jong Un on Tuesday, just a day after the North Korean leader warned the U.S. that Kim had a nuclear button “always on [his] desk” and that the entire United States was “within range of our nuclear weapons.” Earlier in the day, the president once again demeaned Kim as a “rocket man” and later tweeted that his own nuclear button was “a much bigger & more powerful one than his.” Advertisement “And my Button works!” Trump finished. Read more here. He Threatened To Cut Off Foreign Aid To The Palestinians It's not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing, but also many other countries, and others. As an example, we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018 The White House also appeared to threaten hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid to the Palestinians on Tuesday, just hours after America said it would withhold similar funds from Pakistan. Trump lambasted the Palestinians for not giving the U.S. “appreciation or respect,” and accused their leaders of abandoning the peace process with Israel. Tension has risen throughout the Middle East in recent weeks following Trump’s decision to relocate the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Read more here. He Announced Plans For “The Most Dishonest & Corrupt” Media Awards I will be announcing THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR on Monday at 5:00 o’clock. Subjects will cover Dishonesty & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media. Stay tuned! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2018 The president continued his almost daily attacks on the media on Tuesday with a vague joke that he would establish something called “THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR.” Advertisement “Subjects will cover Dishonesty & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media,” he wrote. Earlier Tuesday, Trump lobbed an attack against his favored punching bag, the “Failing” New York Times, and its new publisher. “Get impartial journalists of a much higher standard, lose all of your phony and non-existent “sources,” and treat the President of the United States FAIRLY, so that the next time I (and the people) win, you won’t have to write an apology to your readers for a job poorly done!” Read more here. He Took Credit For The Safety Record Of Commercial Jet Airliners Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news - it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017, the best and safest year on record! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018 Commercial airlines recorded their safest year ever in 2017 after documenting zero accidental deaths on commercial passenger jets around the world. Advertisement Trump moved to take credit for the record early Tuesday, linking the lack of fatalities to his efforts to be “very strict on commercial aviation.” But, as HuffPost’s Ethan Klapper notes, such boasts appear to be overstated. 2017 was just as safe for U.S. aviation as both 2015 and 2016, and the numbers reported this week account for commercial flights worldwide.

News article:
When two strongest democracies in the world elected Donald Trump as US president and Narendra Modi as India's prime minister, peace became the first casualty and their lethal combination along with Israel only added to the miseries of millions of peace-lovers across the world. While one was expecting New Year greetings, Donald Trump dropped a 'New Year bomb’, on Pakistan. Surprisingly, the world's only super power's foreign policy these days is being run through Twitter, and no one can beat US President Donald Trump in this mad race of social media. You can trigger war through one tweet but, not peace. Let us first sympathise with the American people, who themselves got the biggest surprised when he was elected as the president, defeated a much more mature and experienced Hillary Clinton. The world's most liberal democracy had never voted a woman to the White House while Pakistan become the first Muslim country, which elected woman as a prime minister, not once but twice. She was the late Benazir Bhutto. Many thought Ms Clinton would become the first woman in the US to get elected as president. So, which country has more moderate approach when it comes to electing its president or prime minister? Freedom of the Press became the first casualty under Trump, whose war with the media, started much before he got elected and has not ended yet. He calls the US media 'fake news’. Even on the moral ground, he faced criticism over his attitude, and his approach towards women, is no secret to the world and the Americans themselves are not sure how to deal with this most amazing president. Many thought he would be unpredictable but, in the last one year, he proved to be the most predictable president of the United States, and that too on a fast pace. His policies, unfortunately, has endangered the world peace. For instance, when the world rejected Trump's decision on Jerusalem, he refused to respect the UN and 146 countries. On the contrary, his government created history by threatening all those who opposed the US policy with a threat to teach them a lesson. Trump's tweet or threat should be taken as the first step towards that policy. What else one can expect from Trump doctrine except for hate, distrust and insult to the huge sacrifices of the people of Pakistan. This is what he said in what looks like a New Year message to Pakistanis. "The United States has foolishly given 33 billion dollars in aid in over the last 15 years and they have given us nothing, but lies and deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They gave safe havens to terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more." Trump's response of 'No more’ came days after we said, 'No more’ after years of 'Do more' rhetoric. We certainly had committed many mistakes and the biggest one was our decades old policy on Afghanistan. Mr Trump must know that Pakistan was a moderate country before US injected extremism in our policies and asked us to fight its war in 1980, in Afghanistan against Soviet invasion. In return, Pakistan got five million Afghan refugees, gun and drug culture, beside the menace of terrorism and extremism. Thousands of foreign 'Mujahideen' including Arabs were sent to Pakistan to fight the US war. Osama bin Laden was one of them, which years later became the world's most wanted man and mastermind of 9/11. Pakistanis, not Americans, are fools that they trusted the US and became an American ally, soon after the birth of Pakistan. In pursuance of the US policy, the left wing politics in Pakistan was crushed through a ban on Communist Party of Pakistan in 1950s and later on a ban on National Awami Party (NAP) in the 1970s. Now, what should be our response? Pakistan's response should not be as foolish as that of Trump as despite our own weaknesses, we are a responsible nation and the support we got in the United Nation recently provide an ample proof. So, when the world supported us, the US opposed us. Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi called a meeting of the National Security Committee on Tuesday, in which both civil and military leadership discussed the prevailing situation in the aftermath of Trump's warning. The government and the opposition are also on one page on this issue of utmost importance. But, we also have our own problems and it is high time to change our decades old doctrine on Afghanistan. Within the country, rising extremism and terrorism has threatened country's foundations and we need a foreign policy based on live and let live. Pakistan should neither become proxy nor need any proxy. The US has a history of doing adventures like Hiroshima and Nagasaki, from Iraq to Syria, from Afghanistan to Libya. Humans hardly matter for them when it comes to their interests. They have the history of doing this around the world. How could we forget 1977 and 1979? The US made our elected prime minister a 'horrible example’, because he had refused to toe the American line. We were naive that we waited for 7th fleet to arrive during 1971 war. Our response should be candid and well drafted as there is no 'Donald Trump' in Pakistan. We just need to place on record straight: what price we had paid, not only in the last 15 years, but in the last 30 years or to be more specific since the day we decided to become an American ally in the 1950s. It is most shameful that the US president did not acknowledge huge sacrifices Pakistan has given as a nation, not in the last 15 years but in the last 40 years and beyond. It is a matter of history that the US always supported military dictatorships in Pakistan, whether it is Field Marshal Ayub Khan, General Ziaul Haq or General (retd) Pervez Musharraf. People of Pakistan have not yet forgotten its alleged role in overthrowing Pakistan's elected prime minister, the late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a year after he was threatened with a warning of making him a 'horrible example’, if Pakistan did not abandon its nuclear programme, which he refused and was hanged. If the US could support the UN resolution against North Korea, Iraq or against Iran, why it backed out and opposed resolution of its decision on Jerusalem. Surely, the world has changed after 9/11, one of the worst terrorist attacks, which killed over 3,000 innocent people, mostly Americans. But, there was a Pakistani by the name of 'Hamdani’, who gave his life in rescue operations and saved many lives. In the 15 years of war, many Pakistani youngsters gave their lives in defeating terrorism. You don't give or compare death toll in war because every human life is precious, but if the US president insists and calls American foolish in giving 35 billion dollars to Pakistan, please let us know as to how many Americans lost their lives in these years. Our fight against terrorism and extremism must continue as we cannot afford rise of non-state actors, and we must remain alert over the possible drone strikes in settled areas. Pakistan can face economic sanctions or even drone strikes. Pakistan has come a long way to make the country more responsible and peaceful, but the threat of terrorism is not over yet. It is just world's bad luck that when it is looking for peace, two biggest democracies have elected people like Donald Trump in US and Narendra Modi in India.

The row over Trump's 'racist' comments about allowing 's***hole countries' is another chapter in the president's difficult relationship with the United Nations. In December, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley blasted member states who overwhelmingly backed a proposal condemning the US for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and pledging to move its embassy there. The vote was 128–9, with 35 abstentions. Only Guatemala, Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo joined the United States and Israel in opposing the measure. Another 21 countries didn't show up to vote. US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley blasted countries that condemned the US for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital American ambassador Nikki Haley blasted anti-Israel member nations during a pre-vote debate, warning that there would be a price to pay for standing in President Donald Trump's way. 'This vote will be remembered,' she said as the entire UN General Assembly looked on. 'America will put our embassy in Jerusalem. That is what the American people want us to do. And it is the right thing to do. No vote in the United Nations will make any difference on that,' Haley lectured from the central podium. 'But this vote will make a difference on how Americans look at the UN and on how we look at countries who disrespect us in the UN.' Back in September, in Trump's first speech to the UN, he drew a round of applause after attacking Iran, North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela. He called Iran a 'rogue state' for its supposed nuclear ambitions as he criticized the nuclear deal struck by Iran and the Obama administration. 'We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles. And we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program,' Trump said, drawing applause from leaders of more than 180 nations in the room. 'The Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States and I don't think you've heard the last of it, believe me,' he said. 'It's time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction.'

News article:
Washington – Trust in U.S. institutions, particularly the government, has plunged in President Donald Trump’s first year in office, according to a leading survey released on the eve of the World Economic Forum in Davos. The annual Edelman Trust Barometer showed overall trust in the four institutions it measures – the government, media, business and non-governmental organizations – falling more steeply in the United States than in any of the 28 countries surveyed. Trump has broken with presidential tradition and repeatedly denounced the media and judiciary – attacks his critics say risk undermining public confidence in those institutions. By contrast, the country that saw the biggest trust gains among its own citizens was China, after a year in which President Xi Jinping cemented his hold on power at a triumphal party congress. Faith in the Chinese government jumped 8 points to 84 percent. In the United States it fell 14 points to 33 percent. “The United States is enduring an unprecedented crisis of trust,” said Richard Edelman, head of the communications marketing firm that commissioned the research. Xi was the headliner in Davos last year, days before Trump was inaugurated. This year, Trump is the main attraction. He is expected to defend his “America First” policies in a speech on the final day of the conference of policymakers, CEOs, bankers and celebrities in the Swiss Alps, which runs from Jan. 23-26. Pointing to the steep erosion in trust in the United States, Edelman said it was the first time since the survey began 18 years ago that such a precipitous drop was not linked to a specific event, such as an economic crisis or catastrophe, like the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. Instead it comes at a time when the U.S. economy is showing robust growth and stock markets are at record highs. “Normally when things are going well, trust is pretty good,” Edelman said. “Increasingly there is a disconnect between trust and economic outcomes.” FAKE NEWS He attributed this to a politicisation of the public discourse in the United States and elsewhere that has left many people confused about what is fact and what is fiction. The survey showed nearly 2 in 3 people are unable to distinguish reliable news from rumors and falsehoods. While trust in journalism rose to its highest level in years, faith in search engines and social media platforms like Google, Twitter and Facebook fell in 21 of the 28 countries, making media the least trusted of the four institutions globally. The Edelman survey, based on the opinions of over 33,000 people and conducted between Oct. 28 and Nov. 20 of last year, showed an even deeper lack of trust in U.S. institutions among the “informed public” – people who are college educated, earn above-average incomes and consume news regularly. Among this group, trust declined a whopping 23 points, putting the United States in last place among the 28 countries surveyed, below Russia and South Africa. In 2017 it ranked sixth. In the broader U.S. population, faith in the government was equally low among respondents who said they voted for Trump and those who supported his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. But trust in the media was significantly higher among Clinton backers. The survey also showed that Americans’ trust in their own companies fell more steeply than in any other country, with Switzerland and Canada registering the highest levels of trust in their homegrown brands. It showed a revival of faith in “experts”, including academics and businessmen.

Trump Comments Overshadow Annual Summit of African Leaders By Anita Powell January 26, 2018 Dozens of African leaders will convene in Ethiopia on January 28 for the annual summit of the African Union, with the official theme of combating corruption. But already, one man has taken the spotlight at the gathering – and he isn't even attending. U.S. President Donald Trump's incendiary comments about African nations – in which he allegedly used a profane term comparing them to toilets – has deeply resonated among the 55-member body, according to the AU's commission chairman, Moussa Faki Mahamat. "Africa has not yet finished digesting this shocking statement and the hatred and desire to marginalize and exclude Africa that it conveyed," he said. "Such a statement, coming after others by the Trump administration on Jerusalem and the reduction of U.S. funding for international peacekeeping operations, makes one think that multilateralism is in the midst of a grave crisis. The African continent cannot remain silent on this subject." Trump, for his part, denied making the comment during White House talks on immigration earlier this month. Rare words Such harsh words directed at a major ally are rare for the continental body, which makes decisions by consensus and prides itself on multilateralism. This is the second year that the U.S. leader has become a focus in an event meant for African nations to talk about reforming national institutions, restoring peace and improving the lives of some 1.2 billion people on the world's fastest-growing continent. Last year, delegates were upset over the Trump administration's announcement that people from certain countries would be banned from visiting the U.S., which initially targeted three AU member states: Libya, Somalia and Sudan. The ban has since been expanded to include the central African nation of Chad. AU analyst Liesl Luow-Vaudran spoke to VOA from Addis Ababa and said she expects to hear some pointed words against the U.S., but that the remarks are likely to be less vitriolic now that firebrand Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe has left office. Luow-Vaudran also said she does not expect the AU to pass any resolutions on the U.S. And that, she says, is a key weakness of the Addis Ababa-based institution: The AU is built on consensus, and getting 55 members to agree on sensitive issues is a challenge. For example, she says, while it's commendable that the continental body has chosen corruption as its theme this year, members have little power to enforce their resolutions, and are hesitant to make decisions that could be seen as trampling on the sovereignty of other nations. "The AU, for African citizens, has yet to show its relevance when it comes to, for example, intervening in peace and security issues and crises on the continent, which, to an extent, is the core business of the AU," she said. "It needs to intervene where no one else will and mediate in crises. ... But to a large extent, the AU is struggling, because it is such a big organization in terms of member states, but it's a small organization, in terms of capacity." When it comes to the U.S., it is clear the body doesn't speak as one: The AU's current head, Rwandan President Paul Kagame, smiled Friday as he met with Trump on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and discussed trade and cooperation. Neither man spoke about Trump's alleged comments on African countries when they met afterward with reporters. Luow-Vaudran notes, however, that for decades, the only non-African leaders allowed to speak at the opening ceremony – and again on the schedule this year – were Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, and members of the Arab League. More action? Elissa Jobson, AU relations adviser for the International Crisis Group, says she'd like to see more action from the AU. "What I'd like to see on the agenda would be some of the crucial peace and security issues: The [Democratic Republic of] Congo, South Sudan and Somalia, although I expect these will not be on the agenda," she told VOA. "I think we'll probably also see them tackling another crucial issue for the African Union, the institutional reforms that have been spearheaded by Paul Kagame." But that, she says, is the nature of meetings like this. "I think it's similar with a number of summits like this: the main sessions, the formal sessions, countries come with prepared speeches, they're not open to debate, it's a place to get your position across without really, sort of, getting into the details of the subjects that are on the agenda," she said. "So often, the real debate takes place on the sidelines, inside meetings, in bilateral meetings." NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-31 20:06:51|Editor: Lifang Video Player Close WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Donald Trump outlined his second-year agenda in his maiden State of the Union (SOTU) address on Tuesday night, focusing on infrastructure, immigration and national security. Despite the president's attempt to win bipartisan support, analysts say obstacles remain to cooperation between Republicans and Democrats. INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE Trump started his speech by touting the high stock markets and low unemployment in the past year under his presidency along with tax cuts as the foundation for what he claimed to be a "new American moment". After expressing expectations of "fair and reciprocal" trade relationships with others, Trump asked both parties in Congress to pass an infrastructure bill so as to create 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars of investment. He advocated using federal government funds as incentives to stimulate state and local government funds as well as private capital in infrastructure investment. In order to do so, Trump also called on lawmakers to streamline the approval process for infrastructure investment by shortening it to no more than two years. A statement released by the White House on Tuesday said the administration will also enhance its support for infrastructure projects in rural areas. Darrell West, a senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank Brookings Institution, told Xinhua that infrastructure might be the only possibility for bipartisanship. "That may be an area where the parties could come together because each side understands the need to rebuild bridges, highways and dams," West said. But Christopher Galdieri, assistant professor at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire, said "Trump is seeking too large a role for private partners for many Democrats to be comfortable." "There aren't the Republican votes to pass a plan like the one he sketched without Democratic votes," he said. IMMIGRATION OVERHAUL Immigration is one of the policy areas where the Trump administration would like to see legislative progress. During the nearly 90-minute speech, Trump said criminals, including MS-13, the international criminal gang, were taking advantage of "outdated immigration rules". The Republican president also tried to adopt a bipartisan tone on immigration overhaul, calling his proposal a fair compromise that should be supported by both parties. His remarks came after an impasse over the fate of nearly 1 million young illegal immigrants had led to a government shutdown earlier this month. Trump urged both parties to set politics aside and "finally get the job done," laying out his framework for immigration legislation that includes a path to citizenship for 2 million illegal immigrants and securing the border by building a wall on the southern border with Mexico. He also called for an end to the visa lottery and chain migration while adopting a merit-based immigration system in favor of applicants with skills needed by the country. Trump said those pillars "represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system." But he drew protests from Democratic lawmakers when detailing some of those proposals.

NATIONAL SECURITY Renewing one of his campaign promises, Trump urged lawmakers to end what he called a "dangerous defense sequester" and fully fund the U.S. military. Calling for efforts to modernize and rebuild the nuclear arsenal, Trump said while hopefully the U.S. would never have to use it, the arsenal would make it capable of deterring "any acts of aggression". In a reexamination of the military detention policy, Trump said he had signed an order to keep open the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, which was set up in 2002 as part of the U.S. war on terror. The president also pledged to continue the anti-terrorism fight until the Islamic State terrorist group was defeated, urging the Congress to ensure all necessary resources in the fight against terrorists. As for his foreign policy, Trump took a tough stance, calling Iran, Cuba, Venezuela and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea "adversaries". While urging the Congress to address the "fundamental flaws" in the Iran nuclear deal, he also defended his "maximum pressure" campaign against Pyongyang's nuclear development project.

Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-31 20:06:51|Editor: Lifang Video Player Close WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Donald Trump outlined his second-year agenda in his maiden State of the Union (SOTU) address on Tuesday night, focusing on infrastructure, immigration and national security. Despite the president's attempt to win bipartisan support, analysts say obstacles remain to cooperation between Republicans and Democrats. INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE Trump started his speech by touting the high stock markets and low unemployment in the past year under his presidency along with tax cuts as the foundation for what he claimed to be a "new American moment". After expressing expectations of "fair and reciprocal" trade relationships with others, Trump asked both parties in Congress to pass an infrastructure bill so as to create 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars of investment. He advocated using federal government funds as incentives to stimulate state and local government funds as well as private capital in infrastructure investment. In order to do so, Trump also called on lawmakers to streamline the approval process for infrastructure investment by shortening it to no more than two years. A statement released by the White House on Tuesday said the administration will also enhance its support for infrastructure projects in rural areas. Darrell West, a senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank Brookings Institution, told Xinhua that infrastructure might be the only possibility for bipartisanship. "That may be an area where the parties could come together because each side understands the need to rebuild bridges, highways and dams," West said. But Christopher Galdieri, assistant professor at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire, said "Trump is seeking too large a role for private partners for many Democrats to be comfortable." "There aren't the Republican votes to pass a plan like the one he sketched without Democratic votes," he said. IMMIGRATION OVERHAUL Immigration is one of the policy areas where the Trump administration would like to see legislative progress. During the nearly 90-minute speech, Trump said criminals, including MS-13, the international criminal gang, were taking advantage of "outdated immigration rules". The Republican president also tried to adopt a bipartisan tone on immigration overhaul, calling his proposal a fair compromise that should be supported by both parties. His remarks came after an impasse over the fate of nearly 1 million young illegal immigrants had led to a government shutdown earlier this month. Trump urged both parties to set politics aside and "finally get the job done," laying out his framework for immigration legislation that includes a path to citizenship for 2 million illegal immigrants and securing the border by building a wall on the southern border with Mexico. He also called for an end to the visa lottery and chain migration while adopting a merit-based immigration system in favor of applicants with skills needed by the country. Trump said those pillars "represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system." But he drew protests from Democratic lawmakers when detailing some of those proposals. West said it is hard to see how the two sides can do much in this area as the president still wants a wall, which the Democrats will not support.

News article:
Berlin – German Justice Minister Heiko Maas said there was no place for anti-Semitism in Germany after demonstrators angered by U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel burned Israeli flags in Berlin. Hundreds of people gathered outside the U.S. embassy in the German capital for “Day of Rage” protests on Friday. Police later said on Twitter that they had detained 10 people during the protest and 12 criminal charges had been brought — including for burning Israeli flags. Maas told Bild newspaper’s Monday edition: “Any kind of anti-Semitism is an attack on everyone. Anti-Semitism must never be allowed to have a place (in society) again.” Anti-Semitism remains a very sensitive issue in Germany more than 70 years after the end of the Nazi-era Holocaust, in which six million Jews were killed. Germany regards itself as one of Israel’s closest allies. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told Bild that while criticism of Trump’s decision was understandable, people had no right or reason to burn the Israeli flag, stir up hatred against Jews or question Israel’s right to exist. He said whoever did this nonetheless was “taking a stand not only against Israel but also against the German constitution” and Germany would not tolerate that. Gabriel said Germany only permitted peaceful demonstrations and would not allow conflicts in which people were prepared to use violence to be brought to Germany from other countries and played out here.

News article:
By setting symbols of Israel on fire in recent days, demonstrators have raised a legal issue. The burning of national symbols is not forbidden in all cases, although incitement to violence against Jewish people is. Germany's leading politicians have universally condemned the burning of Israeli flags and symbols in Berlin amidst recent demonstrations sparked by US President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. But are such acts actually illegal in Germany? "As to whether the burning of flags on Friday and Sunday can be prosecuted, that's a question for the prosecutor's office in Berlin," a spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said on Monday. "I can only draw attention to the fact that there is a passage in the criminal code, Paragraph 104, concerning damage to foreign countries' and other national symbols." Paragraph 104 reads: "Whosoever removes, destroys, damages, renders unrecognizable or insults by mischief a flag of a foreign state, which is displayed according to legal provisions or recognized custom, or a state symbol of such a state which has been publicly installed by a recognized mission of such state, shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding two years or a fine." But Berlin police say that this law did not apply to what happened in the city last week, when protesters burned at least two Israeli flags in front of the Brandenburg Gate on Friday. "Burning a flag is not a crime, whether it be Israeli or American or from any other nation" Berlin police spokesman Thomas Neuendorf explained to DW. "The only exception is, for instance, when a flag is taken from an official building like an embassy and burned." Burning any kind of objects is forbidden at demonstrations but is only a misdemeanor. Neuendorf said that 10 people were detained at demonstrations over the weekend for throwing bottles and comparable offenses. Demonstrators burned symbols of Israel, causing outrage among politicians Image: picture alliance/dpa/Jüdisches Forum für Demokratie und gegen Antisemitismus e.V. Not necessarily incitement Demonstrators were reported to have chanted anti-Semitic slogans, and Berlin's mayor Michael Müller has promised that further protests will be kept under close observation. Government spokesman Steffen Seibert said that anti-Semitism was not protected under German freedom of speech laws. Read more: German government adopts international anti-Semitism definition "Our freedoms of speech and assembly guarantee everyone the right to peacefully protest," Seibert said on Monday in Berlin. "But this is not a free pass for anti-Semitic excesses, for incitement and violence." But while protesters may have chanted "Israel, murderer of children," they did not necessarily violate Paragraph 130 of the German criminal code, which prohibits "incitement to hatred." "Individual people have to be insulted or threatened for there to be a case made for incitement to hatred," Neuendorf said. A hypothetical example of incitement, Neuendorf explained, would be if someone pointed to a Jewish man wearing a yarmulke and encouraged a crowd to do him harm. "Chants like 'Israel, murderer of children' are covered by freedom of speech," Neuendorf added. Because of Germany's past, statements and acts that can be interpreted as anti-Semitic will always be explosive in the country. But in the recent cases, Berlin police say they do not actually violate criminal law.

News article:
Lawmaker Beatrix von Storch, accused by Cologne police of inciting hatred against Muslims, sees Israel as a model for Germany. (Nicolaus Fest) A neo-Nazi member of Germany’s parliament who has been charged by police with inciting hatred against Muslims is a big fan of Israel. Beatrix von Storch was suspended from Twitter and Facebook after she slammed police in the city of Cologne for this tweet – one of several put out in various languages – wishing the city’s residents happy new year in Arabic: #PolizeiNRW #Köln #Leverkusen تتمنى الشرطة في كولن لجميع الناس في منطقة كولن وليفركوزن والمدن الأخرى إحتفالاً سعيداً بعام 2018 الجديد. https://t.co/G5erMWFNQyرأس السنة 2017 ـ لمزيد المعلومات: # pic.twitter.com/BGxs4Kew7K — Polizei NRW K (@polizei_nrw_k) December 31, 2017 This was an apparent reference to a spate of alleged sexual assaults that were blamed on men from Muslim-majority countries in the city on New Year’s Eve two years ago, and that then fueled exaggerated or outright fabricated claims against immigrants in other parts of Germany. Police have filed a criminal complaint against von Storch for hate speech. Her posts were removed under a new online hate speech law that civil liberties advocates have warned deputizes social media companies to carry out censorship on behalf of the government. Neo-Nazis embrace Israel Von Storch is the deputy leader of Alternative for Germany – known by its German initials AfD – the neo-Nazi party that won almost 100 seats in Germany’s general election last September, prompting alarm from the country’s Jewish community. Like their neo-Nazi counterparts who just joined the government of neighboring Austria, AfD has been cozying up to Israel – a philosemitic stance that aims to rebrand the anti-Semitic far-right as defenders of Jews against a supposed Muslim threat. Their embrace has been reciprocated by politicians in Israel’s ruling Likud party. A granddaughter of Hitler’s last finance minister, von Storch told The Jerusalem Report last September that “For historical and cultural reasons, we will always look for good relations and close cooperation with Israel.” She has been very explicit not only about her party’s support for Israel, but also that hatred of Muslims is one of the values she shares with its Zionist ideology. “Both anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism are strongest in the Islamic community, as well as the Left,” she explained. “They reject the fact that the Judeo-Christian foundations of European civilization are instrumental to its success. We recognize the threat they pose to both Israel and Germany’s Jewish community and their safety is a high priority for us.” Von Storch concluded that “Israel could be a role model for Germany” as a country that “makes efforts to preserve its unique culture and traditions.” This echoes closely the line of American neo-Nazi demagogue Richard Spencer who speaks of Zionism as a key model for the kind of Aryan homeland he seeks to create under the guise of preserving “European” culture. Not surprisingly, von Storch’s Jerusalem Report interview was promoted approvingly by Breitbart, a major platform for racism and white supremacy. Israel as racist model Von Storch’s identification with Israel is a symptom of the long-standing alliance between the right, and even anti-Semites, on the one hand, and Zionism and Israel, on the other. This alliance has recently found new life in a common hatred of Muslims. Israeli leaders have habitually exploited violent attacks in Europe to further stoke Islamophobia and justify their own violence against Palestinians. Yet while many mainstream commentators in Germany can be expected to express horror at von Storch’s anti-Muslim incitement, few dare speak out in criticism of Israel – including its prominent role in fomenting xenophobia and hatred of Muslims as part of its effort to push Europe further into its far-right camp. Indeed, Germany’s establishment appears to be less tolerant than ever of advocacy for full, equal civil, political and human rights for Palestinians. In December, the city council in Munich passed a measure smearing the BDS – boycott, divestment and sanctions – movement. The Palestinian BDS National Committee had written to city councillors to explain that the definition of anti-Semitism cited in the resolution is one drawn up by Israel lobbyists to deliberately conflate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism. Yet there do appear to be cracks. Foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel is under intense attack from Israel for stating a simple truth. Israel’s public security minister Gilad Erdan, who is also in charge of combatting the BDS movement, accused Gabriel of engaging in speech that “demonizes and delegitimizes the Jewish state.” Gabriel reportedly told a group of Muslim representatives in December that when he visited the occupied West Bank city of Hebron a few years ago, what he witnessed reminded him of apartheid.

News article:
Berlin – German lawmakers have voted to install a commissioner who would coordinate government activities against anti-Semitism. The lower house approved by a wide majority Thursday a motion proposed by four of the six parliamentary groups to install the official, who would be chosen by independent experts. The center-left Social Democrats called for the commissioner to be installed at the chancellery. The decision follows a recommendation by a panel of experts and comes amid concern over anti-Semitic incidents during recent pro-Palestinian protests. Volker Kauder, the parliamentary leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative Union bloc, told lawmakers that far-right motives are behind the bulk of anti-Semitic crimes but there’s been a rising number of acts by migrants. He said “we must not allow either of these things.”

A Saudi fighter jet been shot down in Yemen by Iran backed Houthi rebels, Press TV reported quoting Arabic-language al-Masirah television on Wednesday. According to the TV, F-15 fighter jet belonging to the Royal Saudi Air Force was targeted with a surface-to-air missile as it was flying in the skies over northwestern Yemeni province of Sa'ada. There was no independent confirmation of the report ran by Iranian's regimes's propaganda tool. The conflift in Yemeni began in 2015 between two factions, each claiming to constitute the Yemeni government, along with their supporters and allies. Houthi rebels fighting the Saudi-led coalition are backed by Iran in the conflict that has killed thousands civilians since the war began. Images and a video of the falling plane emerged on Twitter but their authenticity was also not confirmed.

An Egyptian national was killed by shrapnel in Saudi Arabia on Sunday when Saudi forces shot down seven ballistic missiles launched by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said. Saudi air-defence forces say they intercepted three missiles aimed at the capital Riyadh and four others fired at the southern cities of Khamis Mushait, Najran and Jizan, according to Colonel Turki Al-Malki, spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. Shrapnel from the missiles fell on residential areas in Riyadh, killing an Egyptian resident and wounding two other Egyptians, the SPA quoted Al-Malki as saying. "This hostile action and indiscriminate action by the Iran-backed Houthi group proves the continued involvement of the Iranian regime in supporting the armed Houthi group with qualitative capabilities," Al-Malki said. "The firing of multiple ballistic missiles towards populated cities contravenes international human laws and ... is a serious development." The Saudi-led coalition launched an airstrike campaign in Yemen in March 2015 to fight Iran-backed Houthi rebels after they seized parts of Yemen, including the capial Sanaa and forced President Abd Rabbu Mansour Al-Hadi to flee. The Saudi military says the Houthis have fired dozens of missiles into Saudi Arabia since last year, all of which were intercepted. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
By News desk RIYADH/SANAA: The Houthi movement that controls northern Yemen vowed on Monday to fire more missiles into Saudi Arabia unless it stops bombing the country, after missiles crashed into Riyadh overnight causing casualties in the Saudi capital for the first time. The incident threatens to sharply escalate a war that has already unleashed what the United Nations considers the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis. Millions of people live under threat of mass starvation and disease, at the mercy of combatants who have shut food and medical supplies in the past. Saudi forces said they shot down three missiles over Riyadh shortly before midnight. Debris fell on a home in the capital, killing an Egyptian resident and wounding two other Egyptians. Air defences also repelled missiles fired at the southern Saudi cities of Najran, Jizan and Khamis Mushait, Saudi-led coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said. A top Houthi leader hailed the attack, which took place on the eve of the third anniversary of the entry into the Yemen war by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies. “We praise the successful advance of military capabilities,” Houthi political council chief Saleh al-Samad told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters in the Yemeni capital Sanaa. “If they want peace, as we have said to them before, stop your air strikes and we will stop our missiles,” he said. “If you continue your air strikes we have a right to defend ourselves by all means available.” The war pits a coalition of Sunni Arab states friendly to the West against a Shia armed movement sympathetic to Iran. The Houthis control the north of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa. Saudi Arabia and its allies have been fighting on behalf of an exiled government with a foothold in the south. Khattab Gamal, a 27-year-old Egyptian electrician who lived in the Riyadh house hit by the debris, told Reuters he and his 15 housemates were awoken by loud explosions. “We knew something fell on the room where Abdulmuttalib was asleep. There were three others in the same room with him. All were asleep at the time of explosion. They all rushed and ran out and then we realized he was missing.” “We kept looking for him and realized he was still inside, we went back and tried to enter the room and save him but we couldn’t,” Gamal said by telephone. “There was a lot of dust and the smell was suffocating. A few minutes later the civil defence came and got him out but he was already dead.” The Saudi-led coalition has launched thousands of air strikes on Yemen in the past three years, some of which have hit hospitals, schools and markets, killing hundreds of civilians while bringing Riyadh little closer to military victory. The kingdom has said hundreds of its own soldiers and civilians have been killed in Houthi mortar and short-range missile attacks across their rugged southern border. The United Nations says 10,000 people have died so far in the war in the region’s poorest country, and three out of four Yemenis - 22 million civilians - need relief aid. The conflict has caused the worst cholera outbreak in modern history, with more than 1 million reported cases. Last year, when the Houthis fired missiles at Riyadh which were intercepted without doing damage, the Arab coalition responded by shutting Yemen’s airports and ports, a blockade that the United Nations said raised the prospect of mass starvation before it was partially lifted. Western countries have urged Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies to protect civilians and find a quick end to the war. But they also support Riyadh’s argument that it needs to defend itself from cross border strikes and limit the spread of Iranian influence in territory overlooking important trade routes. “The transfer of missile capabilities to non-state actors that may be used against states is irresponsible and contrary to law,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a statement on Monday, appearing to refer to Iran. The United Arab Emirates, a key ally of Saudi Arabia in its military campaign, blamed Iran directly. “The message of the Houthi-Iranian missiles is clear,” said Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash wrote on his official Twitter account. “There’s no coexisting with a terrorist militia which threatens the stability of our region and is a proxy of Tehran.” Pakistan too condemned the missile attack, as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: “Pakistan commends the Government of Saudi Arabia for destroying the missiles and limiting the casualties.” “The Government of Pakistan reiterated its full support and solidarity with the leadership, the government and people of Saudi Arabia against any threats to its territorial integrity and against the Harmain Sharifain.” Separately Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif in a tweet said, “We strongly condemn missile attack on Saudi Arabia. Pakistan remains fully committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom.” The Saudi military depends on service contracts with Western arms companies to keep its planes flying. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman discussed the war with US President Donald Trump during a visit to the White House last week, and with British Prime Minister Theresa May in London the previous week. Saudi Arabia viewed the 2014 takeover of Sanaa by the Houthis as part of a regional strategy by arch-foe Tehran to encircle it. Independent UN experts reported to the Security Council in January that Houthi missiles they had examined and other military equipment had been manufactured in Iran. The Houthis deny they are Iranian pawns, and say their movement has spawned a national revolution against corruption. Diplomats and Yemeni political officials reported this month that the Houthis and Saudi Arabia were conducting secret peace talks after years of UN-mediated dialogue yielded no results.

The incident threatens to sharply escalate a war that has already unleashed what the United Nations considers the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis. Millions of people live under threat of mass starvation and disease, at the mercy of combatants who have shut food and medical supplies in the past. Saudi forces said they shot down three missiles over Riyadh shortly before midnight. Debris fell on a home in the capital, killing an Egyptian resident and wounding two other Egyptians. Air defences also repelled missiles fired at the southern Saudi cities of Najran, Jizan and Khamis Mushait, Saudi-led coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said. A top Houthi leader hailed the attack, which took place on the eve of the third anniversary of the entry into the Yemen war by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies. “We praise the successful advance of military capabilities,” Houthi political council chief Saleh al-Samad told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters in the Yemeni capital Sanaa. “If they want peace, as we have said to them before, stop your air strikes and we will stop our missiles,” he said. “If you continue your air strikes we have a right to defend ourselves by all means available.” The war pits a coalition of Sunni Arab states friendly to the West against a Shia armed movement sympathetic to Iran. The Houthis control the north of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa. Saudi Arabia and its allies have been fighting on behalf of an exiled government with a foothold in the south. Khattab Gamal, a 27-year-old Egyptian electrician who lived in the Riyadh house hit by the debris, told Reuters he and his 15 housemates were awoken by loud explosions. “We knew something fell on the room where Abdulmuttalib was asleep. There were three others in the same room with him. All were asleep at the time of explosion. They all rushed and ran out and then we realized he was missing.” “We kept looking for him and realized he was still inside, we went back and tried to enter the room and save him but we couldn’t,” Gamal said by telephone. “There was a lot of dust and the smell was suffocating. A few minutes later the civil defence came and got him out but he was already dead.” The Saudi-led coalition has launched thousands of air strikes on Yemen in the past three years, some of which have hit hospitals, schools and markets, killing hundreds of civilians while bringing Riyadh little closer to military victory. The kingdom has said hundreds of its own soldiers and civilians have been killed in Houthi mortar and short-range missile attacks across their rugged southern border. The United Nations says 10,000 people have died so far in the war in the region’s poorest country, and three out of four Yemenis - 22 million civilians - need relief aid. The conflict has caused the worst cholera outbreak in modern history, with more than 1 million reported cases. Last year, when the Houthis fired missiles at Riyadh which were intercepted without doing damage, the Arab coalition responded by shutting Yemen’s airports and ports, a blockade that the United Nations said raised the prospect of mass starvation before it was partially lifted. Western countries have urged Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies to protect civilians and find a quick end to the war. But they also support Riyadh’s argument that it needs to defend itself from cross border strikes and limit the spread of Iranian influence in territory overlooking important trade routes. “The transfer of missile capabilities to non-state actors that may be used against states is irresponsible and contrary to law,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a statement on Monday, appearing to refer to Iran. The United Arab Emirates, a key ally of Saudi Arabia in its military campaign, blamed Iran directly. “The message of the Houthi-Iranian missiles is clear,” said Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash wrote on his official Twitter account. “There’s no coexisting with a terrorist militia which threatens the stability of our region and is a proxy of Tehran.” Pakistan too condemned the missile attack, as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: “Pakistan commends the Government of Saudi Arabia for destroying the missiles and limiting the casualties.” “The Government of Pakistan reiterated its full support and solidarity with the leadership, the government and people of Saudi Arabia against any threats to its territorial integrity and against the Harmain Sharifain.” Separately Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif in a tweet said, “We strongly condemn missile attack on Saudi Arabia. Pakistan remains fully committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom.” The Saudi military depends on service contracts with Western arms companies to keep its planes flying. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman discussed the war with US President Donald Trump during a visit to the White House last week, and with British Prime Minister Theresa May in London the previous week. Saudi Arabia viewed the 2014 takeover of Sanaa by the Houthis as part of a regional strategy by arch-foe Tehran to encircle it. Independent UN experts reported to the Security Council in January that Houthi missiles they had examined and other military equipment had been manufactured in Iran. The Houthis deny they are Iranian pawns, and say their movement has spawned a national revolution against corruption. Diplomats and Yemeni political officials reported this month that the Houthis and Saudi Arabia were conducting secret peace talks after years of UN-mediated dialogue yielded no results.

News article:
The seven ballistic missiles launched at four Saudi cities by the Houthis underscore the correctness of waging the war against them and the soundness of the warnings about Iran’s role in the region. It is Iran that smuggles the missiles and orchestrates their launching into Saudi Arabia. On Sunday night we witnessed the first major attack on Saudi Arabia since the start of Iran’s efforts to control Yemen three years ago. But despite the large number of missiles launched and the distance they crossed, the operation remains a mere show, and the four missiles in the skies over Riyadh were no more than fireworks. It is no coincidence that they were launched on the third anniversary of the war against the coup staged by the Houthi militias and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. While the missiles failed to hit any vital target, they succeeded in enabling the Saudi government to remind everyone that the war against the Houthis and their allies was and continues to be war of necessity. Currently, the Houthis control about a quarter of Yemen — with great difficulty, even in their stronghold Saada governorate. There was a time when they controlled all of Yemen, including the city of Aden in the south, to the extent that the legitimate government led by President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi had to flee through Oman to Saudi Arabia. Thus, had the military campaign not been launched, Yemen as a whole, not just a quarter of it, including its ports and airports, would have been under Iranian influence; and the Iranians would have been able to fire thousands of ballistic missiles and conventional rockets into Saudi territory. Those who denounce the military solution, on the third anniversary of the war, should imagine what would have happened had Yemen, or most of it, still been under the control of the Houthis and other rebels. The situation would have been frightening; much worse and more serious for both Yemen and Saudi Arabia, and would have caused a wider war than the one we have witnessed in the past 36 months. The launch of the seven missiles was a propaganda show, but it does not demonstrate a superior capability on the part of the Houthis; rather, it proves their inability to use missiles as they would wish. It also proves that the quarter of the country that they still hold in the north of Yemen requires military liberation, instead of relying solely on political action. However, the area that the Houthis control is rugged, mountainous and densely populated; moreover, the rebels are using civilians there as human shields to prevent aerial bombardment. The missile attack on Riyadh, which killed one person and injured two, confirms that Saudi Arabia and the Coalition it leads must complete the journey to Sanaa, liberate Yemen from Houthi control, and restore it as a state with a central authority headed by the legitimate government. In the past, all efforts to persuade the Coalition to halt military operations and attempt a political solution proved to be misguided; and could have led, indeed, to serious consequences. At present, however, the Houthis and the Iranians are struggling to smuggle their missiles into the country, and their numbers have been limited by the continuation of the fighting. Even the seven missiles launched on Sunday, and the ones launched before, were mostly fired at random as a result of the Coalition’s military activity, which is hunting the Houthis down in the areas under their control. Hence, any suggestion that political negotiation could reduce or stop military action would only achieve what the Houthis desire — which is to reorganize their forces on the ground and obtain more supplies of arms and fuel. Iran, through its Houthi agents, has now condemned itself in front of the new international envoy, Martin Griffiths. Met by the multiple missile attack on Saudi Arabia, Griffiths can see that a political solution cannot be based on granting the Houthis any political concessions outside the framework of the original political project; which calls for participation under the exclusive framework of the legitimate government, and the need to withdraw all weapons from the warring parties “outside” that legitimate government. There is no political solution that can justify granting the Houthis, and others, a mandate over some areas, allowing them to keep their weapons, or giving them a greater role in the political process.

Responding to reports that the Huthi armed group in Yemen fired seven ballistic missiles at airports in Riyadh and other Saudi Arabian cities overnight on Sunday, killing one civilian, Samah Hadid, Middle East Deputy Director for Campaigns at Amnesty International, said: “Launching indiscriminate attacks is prohibited by international humanitarian law and can constitute a war crime. A high death toll may have been averted, possibly due to the missiles being intercepted, but that doesn’t let the Huthi armed group off the hook for this reckless and unlawful act. These missiles cannot be precisely targeted at such distances, so their use in this manner unlawfully endangers civilians. “These unlawful attacks must not be used as an excuse by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition to indiscriminately attack civilians or further exacerbate Yemen’s humanitarian crisis by imposing yet more restrictions on importing aid and essential goods such as food, medicine and fuel. “We have documented extensively how all sides have violated international law in the Yemen conflict over the past three years. Saudi Arabia-led coalition airstrikes have recklessly destroyed and damaged Yemeni homes, hospitals, schools and markets. As a result, thousands of civilians have lost their lives and millions are displaced and in dire need of humanitarian aid. But violations by one side do not give the other side license to flout international humanitarian law.” Attack 'intercepted' According to initial media reports, including from the Saudi Arabian state press agency, all seven missiles were intercepted and destroyed, but an Egyptian national was killed after sustaining shrapnel wounds in the aftermath. The Huthi missiles were launched on the third anniversary of the beginning of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition’s campaign of airstrikes in Yemen.

News article:
The Houthi movement that controls northern Yemen vowed on Monday to fire more missiles into Saudi Arabia unless it stops bombing the country, after one of its missiles caused casualties in the Saudi capital for the first time, Reuters reports. The Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis accused them of using Iranian-made missiles. Spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said the coalition reserved the right to respond to Iran "at the appropriate time and manner", under international law and within the framework of the United Nations, to protect Saudi Arabia. The incident threatens to sharply escalate a war that has already unleashed what the United Nations considers the world's most urgent humanitarian crisis. Millions of Yemenis live under threat of mass starvation and disease, at the mercy of combatants who have sometimes cut off food and medical supplies. Saudi forces said they shot down three missiles over Riyadh shortly before midnight. Debris fell on a home in the capital, killing an Egyptian man and wounding two others. Air defences also repelled missiles fired at the southern Saudi cities of Najran, Jizan and Khamis Mushait, the coalition said. The attacks stripped away the sense of calm in Riyadh, a city which until recent months had never quite felt at war. A Houthi leader hailed the attack, which took place as Yemen marked the third anniversary of the start of the war. "We praise the successful advance of military capabilities," Houthi political council chief Saleh al-Samad told tens of thousands of supporters in the Yemeni capital Sanaa. "If they want peace, as we have said to them before, stop your air strikes and we will stop our missiles," he said. "If you continue your air strikes, we have a right to defend ourselves by all means available." The war pits a coalition of Sunni Arab states friendly to the West against the Houthis, a Shi'ite armed movement sympathetic to Iran. The Houthis, who deny they are Iranian pawns and say their movement is a national revolution against corruption, control the north of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa. Saudi Arabia and its allies have been fighting on behalf of an exiled government with a foothold in the south. Read: Yemen workers held in dire conditions in Saudi prison Al-Malki accused Iran of providing the Houthis with ballistic capabilities and said the international community must "work together to combat this dangerous escalation" which threatened security in the region and beyond. At a press event in Riyadh, he displayed what he said were the remnants of a missile fired into Riyadh alongside an Iranian-manufactured Sayyad 2 missile he said had been part of a seized shipment on its way to Houthi fighters in Yemen. Independent UN experts reported to the Security Council in January that Houthi missiles they had examined and other military equipment had been manufactured in Iran. Last year, when the Houthis fired missiles at Riyadh which were intercepted, the Arab coalition responded by shutting Yemen's airports and ports.

Western countries have urged Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies to protect civilians and find a quick end to the war. But they also support Riyadh's argument that it needs to defend itself from cross border strikes and limit the spread of Iranian influence in territory overlooking important trade routes. The US Pentagon blamed Iran for exacerbating the conflict. "This follows Iran's pattern of providing advanced weapons to the Houthis," spokeswoman Lieutenant Commander Rebecca Rebarich said in a statement. "Iran has enabled the conflict in Yemen to spill into neighbouring countries and undermines international efforts to resolve the conflict, exacerbating the suffering of the Yemeni people." French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, appearing to refer to Iran, said in a statement that the transfer of missile capabilities to non-state actors that may be used against states is "irresponsible and contrary to law". Anwar Gargash, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, a Saudi military ally, tweeted: "The message of the Houthi-Iranian missiles is clear. There's no coexisting with a terrorist militia which threatens the stability of our region and is a proxy of Tehran."

Yemen's Houthi rebels launched a ballistic missile at the Saudi city of Jazan on Thursday evening that was intercepted by the kingdom's air defences before it could hit its target. Colonel Turki Al Malki, spokesman of the Saudi-led coalition forces in Yemen, said the missile was launched towards Jazan at 9.35pm from Saada province, a stronghold of the Iran-backed rebels, and was deliberately targeted at densely populated areas in the southern Saudi city. Col Al Malki said the attack was further evidence of Iran's arming of the Houthi militias, in violation of UN resolutions 2216 and 2231, with the aim of threatening the security of Saudi Arabia and the region, as well as international security. #المملكة_آمنة_قوية | #جازان_الآن بفضل من الله.. أبطالنا يقفون في وجه أي محاولات عدائية تستهدف أمننا 🇸🇦 pic.twitter.com/I6i0ERxQMn — وزارة الخارجية 🇸🇦 (@KSAMOFA) March 29, 2018 Launching ballistic missiles towards villages, cities and populated areas is considered a blatant breach of international humanitarian law, he said.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi air defense forces intercepted a missile fired by Houthi fighters in neighboring Yemen at the southern Saudi city of Najran on Saturday, the Saudi-led coalition said. In a statement carried by state news agency SPA the coalition said that according to initial findings an Indian resident was injured by falling debris after the missile was intercepted. The Houthi-run Saba news agency earlier said a missile was fired at a Saudi National Guard base in Najran, and that it had led to "losses in the ranks of the enemy and its military equipment". The Iran-aligned Houthis have launched scores of missiles at the kingdom since the coalition intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 after the Houthis drove Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile. Last week, Saudi air defense forces intercepted a flurry of missiles, and falling debris caused the first death in the capital Riyadh. Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of supplying missile parts and expertise to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and other parts of the country. Tehran and the Houthis deny the charge.

An image grab from a video handed out by Huthi rebels shows what appears to be Huthi military forces launching a ballistic missile Saudi air defences intercepted a missile fired by Yemeni rebels at the kingdom's southern city of Najran on Saturday, the Saudi-led coalition fighting the rebels said, adding that one person was wounded. "The missile was fired at Najran indiscriminately and with the aim of hitting residential areas," coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki told the official Saudi Press Agency. "It was successfully intercepted and the debris fell on residential areas, lightly wounding one Indian expatriate." Yemen's Saba news agency, run by the Iran-backed Huthi rebels, said the missile had been fired at a Saudi National Guard base in Najran, just over the border from Yemen where the Saudi-led coalition intervened on the side of the government in March 2015. The coalition said on Thursday it intercepted another missile fired by the Huthis at the southern city of Jazan -- the latest in a series of such attacks that have drawn widespread condemnation. The coalition spokesman again hit out at Iran after Saturday's attack, accusing it of "jeopardising the security of Saudi Arabia, the region and the whole world." The UN Security Council this week condemned "in the strongest possible terms" multiple missile attacks launched by the Huthis on Saudi territory, saying they posed a threat to regional security. In one of the biggest such attacks yet, Saudi forces last weekend said they intercepted seven missiles fired by rebels toward cities including Riyadh, killing one person. The coalition intervened in Yemen to push back the Huthis who captured the capital Sanaa and forced the government into exile. Riyadh has accused arch-rival Tehran of providing the missiles and threatened retaliation against Iran. Tehran has denied making any arms deliveries and has said the Saudi accusations are a smokescreen intended to divert attention from its deadly bombing campaign against rebel-held areas, including Sanaa. Civilian casualties from coalition air strikes have drawn criticism from human rights groups, and in October the United Nations placed the coalition on a blacklist for killing and maiming children.

An image grab from a video handed out by Huthi rebels shows what appears to be Huthi military forces launching a ballistic missile Saudi air defences intercepted a missile fired by Yemeni rebels at the kingdom's southern city of Najran on Saturday, the Saudi-led coalition fighting the rebels said, adding that one person was wounded. "The missile was fired at Najran indiscriminately and with the aim of hitting residential areas," coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki told the official Saudi Press Agency. "It was successfully intercepted and the debris fell on residential areas, lightly wounding one Indian expatriate." Yemen's Saba news agency, run by the Iran-backed Huthi rebels, said the missile had been fired at a Saudi National Guard base in Najran, just over the border from Yemen where the Saudi-led coalition intervened on the side of the government in March 2015.

News article:
DUBAI/GENEVA (Reuters) - Yemen’s Houthi group hit a Saudi oil tanker off the main port city of Hodeidah on Tuesday, the Saudi-led coalition said, in an attack that could complicate a new United Nations push to end a war that has killed more than 10,000 people. The Iranian-aligned Houthis said they had targeted a coalition warship in response to an air strike on Hodeidah on Monday that killed at least a dozen civilians, including seven children. Tensions have been rising in recent days after the Houthis, who control most of northern Yemen, launched a series of missile strikes on Saudi Arabia, including the capital Riyadh, in recent days. In a statement carried by Saudi media, the coalition said the oil tanker was in international waters when it came under “Houthi-Iranian attack” at around 1330 local time (1030 GMT). A coalition warship conducted a “swift intervention” foiling the attack, it said, without identifying the type of weapon used in the assault. “As a result of that attack, the tanker was subjected to a slight but ineffective hit and it resumed its naval course northwards, escorted by a coalition warship,” the statement said. A European Union naval force that operates in the region confirmed the ship was underway, adding that the crew were safe and unharmed. The media department of the Houthi-run Yemeni military said naval forces had “targeted a battleship belonging to the coalition in response to the bombardment of displaced people in Hodeidah”. It gave no further details. The department’s text message was referring to an air strike by the Saudi-led coalition on Monday in Houthi-controlled Hodeidah that destroyed a house and killed 12 civilians from the same family, including seven children. A coalition spokesman said the alliance takes the report very seriously, promising a full investigation. Last week, Saudi air defences intercepted a flurry of missiles, and falling debris caused the first death in the capital Riyadh. Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of supplying missiles to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and other parts of the country. Tehran and the Houthis deny the charge. CALL FOR ENDING WAR Earlier on Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the warring sides in Yemen to reach a political settlement to end a conflict now in its fourth year that has left 22 million people in urgent need of aid. Speaking in Geneva on the sidelines of a U.N. pledging conference for Yemen, Guterres said his Special Envoy Martin Griffiths will head to the United Arab Emirates, Oman and the Yemeni government-held city of Aden in the drive for peace, Guterres told reporters. Griffiths has already held talks with Houthi authorities as well as internationally-recognised Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and Saudi officials in Riyadh. Guterres said he saw “positive perspectives” for preparing a plan of action “to lead to an effective inter-Yemeni dialogue able to achieve a political solution, with of course the involvement of all those that are relevant in this conflict”. “I am optimistic about that possibility,” the United Nations chief added. He announced that more than $2 billion has been pledged towards a U.N. humanitarian appeal of $3 billion for Yemen this year. It includes $930 million from Saudi Arabia and the UAE which lead the coalition air strikes. Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdel-Malek al-Mekhlafi called for a return to the negotiating table to end the war in the Arabian peninsula’s poorest country and said his government was working to open blockaded ports and airports to aid.

A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, Turki Al-Maliki, accused Houthi rebels on Tuesday of attacking a Saudi Arabian oil tanker in the Red Sea. According to the official Saudi Press Agency, Al-Maliki said that the tanker suffered minor damage but was able to continue on its northwards course towards Saudi territorial waters escorted by a coalition warship. The spokesman said that the "Houthi-Iranian" attack took place at 13:30 local time while the tanker was sailing in international waters west of the port of Hodeida. "The attempted attack failed, after a coalition warship implemented a swift intervention," Al-Maliki explained. Such a "terrorist attack," he added, "poses a serious threat to freedom of shipping and international trade in the Bab Al-Mandab Strait and the Red Sea. It could also cause environmental and economic damage." Read: Houthis target Saudi oil tanker off Yemen Al-Maliki pointed out that the coalition forces led by Riyadh will continue to adopt and implement all measures and means to preserve security and stability and ensure freedom of navigation and international trade in the region.

RIYADH: Yemeni rebels on Tuesday attacked a Saudi oil tanker in the Red Sea, causing “minor damage”, state media said citing the Saudi-led military coalition against the Iran-backed insurgents. “A Saudi oil tanker was subjected to an Iranian Huthi attack off Hodeida port,” the Saudi Press Agency quoted a coalition spokesman as saying, without revealing the nature of the assault.The tanker continued on its route “after the rapid intervention of a coalition naval vessel”, the statement read. No casualties were immediately reported.It came a day after the United Nations said children were among 16 Yemenis killed in an apparent coalition air strike in Hodeida province, calling it “one of the deadliest attacks” on minors in the country for years. The coalition said Tuesday’s rebel assault “highlighted the dangers posed by Huthi militias and their backers to regional security”, in a reference to Iran.

RIYADH (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said on Wednesday that Saudi Arabia’s air defense had intercepted a missile that the armed Houthi movement said it fired at storage tanks belonging to Saudi Aramco oil company. Debris fell on residential areas when the missile, launched towards the southwestern Saudi Arabian port of Jizan, was destroyed around 2130 (1830 GMT) but there were no reported casualties or damage, coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said. Aramco said on Twitter that all its facilities in Jizan were safe and operating normally. Tensions have risen in recent days after the Houthis, who control most of northern Yemen, launched a series of missile strikes on Saudi Arabia which the coalition said were intercepted.

A Saudi soldier from an artillery unit walks near ammunition at a position close to the Saudi-Yemeni border, in Saudi Arabia's southwestern Jazan province. (AFP) Asharq Al-Awsat The Arab coalition to support legitimacy in Yemen announced on Wednesday that the Saudi air defense system intercepted two drones sent by the Houthi militias from Yemeni territories, reported the Saudi Press Agency. Coalition spokesman Colonel Turki Al-Malki said that the drones were downed in the southern cities of Abha and Jazan. In a statement, he explained that the air defense system detected at 07:40 am an unidentified body flying towards Abha International Airport. It quickly destroyed it due to the rules of engagement. Air navigation was closed soon after in accordance with the global aviation laws. It was resumed shortly after. Malki announced that specialists from the Arab coalition examined the fragments of the body and found that it was a Houthi drone with Iranian features and specifications. He accused them of trying to target the airport in violation of International Humanitarian Law. In Jazan, he said that an unidentified body was flown towards a civilian area in the city. It was monitored and later destroyed by the air defense. No casualties were reported in the incident. Immediate tests conducted by specialists revealed that the body of the drone was identical to the one downed in Abha. The Arab coalition warned in the strongest terms the Iran-backed Houthis against targeting civilian areas and people, saying that a retaliation is justified. The command will take all deterrent actions in accordance with International Humanitarian Law and rules, Malki said. Arms monitor Conflict Armament Research said it has evidence that the drones used on Wednesday and other Houthi kit were made in Iran and was not of indigenous design and construction “in contrast to Houthi statements”.

(Adds details on Jizan refinery in para 4) DUBAI, April 11 (Reuters) - Yemen's armed Houthi movement said on Wednesday it had launched a drone strike on a facility belonging to oil giant Saudi Aramco in southern Saudi Arabia - though the company said its facilities there were operating "normally and safely". The Houthis' Al-Masirah TV channel did not say when the attack took place or give details of any damage. "The air force announced the execution of air strikes with the Qasef-1 aircraft on Aramco in Jizan (province)," the channel said on its Twitter account, referring to a drone the Houthis unveiled last year. Saudi Aramco is building a 400,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Jizan, part of a new economic city on the Red Sea. The refinery is expected to become fully operational in 2019. Al-Masirah said the Houthis had also launched an attack with the same model of drone on the airport of Abha in neighbouring Asir province. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab states intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 to try and push back the Houthis after the movement drove the internationally recognized government into Saudi exile. The coalition has launched thousands of air strikes which have hit schools, markets and hospitals, killing hundreds of people - though it says it does not target civilians. The Houthis have stepped up ballistic missile attacks on the kingdom in what it says is retaliation for the air raids. They have frequently claimed attacks, including on Aramco facilities, that Saudi Arabia and its main ally the United Arab Emirates have either said did not happen or were intercepted. The group unveiled what it said was a series of drones, including the Qasef-1, at a ceremony last year. The arms monitor Conflict Armament Research (CAR) said it had evidence showing the Qasef-1 and other Houthi kit was made in Iran and was not of indigenous design and construction "in contrast to Houthi statements". The coalition accuses the Houthis of being armed and supported by Iran - charges the group and Tehran deny.

On Wednesday, Saudi air defense forces intercepted three ballistic missiles over Saudi Arabia, including one that targeted the capital Riyadh. The joint forces command of the Saudi-led coalition warned the Iranian-backed Houthi militias of targeting civilian locations or civilians and said that such terrorist acts would be firmly retaliated. The joint forces command vowed to take all deterrent measures in accordance with international humanitarian law and its customary rules. The intensity of such attack has increased since the completion of the third year of the coalition's war in Yemen against Houthis in March. The coalition has been accusing Iran of standing behind the militias through weapon supply and other supports.

On Wednesday, Saudi air defense forces intercepted three ballistic missiles over Saudi Arabia, including one that targeted the capital Riyadh. The joint forces command of the Saudi-led coalition warned the Iranian-backed Houthi militias of targeting civilian locations or civilians and said that such terrorist acts would be firmly retaliated. The joint forces command vowed to take all deterrent measures in accordance with international humanitarian law and its customary rules. The intensity of such attack has increased since the completion of the third year of the coalition's war in Yemen against Houthis in March. The coalition has been accusing Iran of standing behind the militias through weapon supply and other supports.

News article:
Saudi soldiers take their position at Saudi Arabia's border with Yemen. (Reuters) Washington, Riyadh – Atef Abdul Latif and Asharq Al-Awsat Saudi air defenses intercepted on Thursday night a new ballistic missile fired by the Iran-backed Houthis towards the Kingdom. Official spokesman for Coalition Forces Supporting Legitimacy in Yemen Colonel Turki Al-Malki said that the missile was launched by the militias in Yemen’s Saada province and targeted residential areas in the city of Jizan in southern Saudi Arabia. The missile was was intercepted and destroyed by the Royal Saudi Air Defense Forces, resulting in the scattering of its shrapnel debris on residential neighborhoods. There were no reports of any casualties or damage. The failed attempt to target Jizan coincided with the flow of Arab and international condemnation of the Houthis, who on Wednesday fired missiles against Saudi cities. All of the rockets were intercepted by air defenses. The United States State Department condemned the attack, saying the Kingdom has the right to defend its borders against the militias. The attack, it said, raises questions on just how committed the Houthis are towards achieving peace and building a secure and prosperous future for Yemen. Director of the Center for Gulf Affairs at the Middle East Institute Gerald Feierstein told Asharq Al-Awsat that the Houthis were using such attacks against Saudi Arabia to embarrass it before its own people. They are attempting to demonstrate that the Saudi armed forces were incapable of protecting their borders and territories, he continued. The arms used by the Houthis in their attacks cannot really achieve real military purposes because they lack the means to target vital infrastructure, he went on to say. He stressed that the US must continue to support Saudi Arabia and the Arab Coalition in their efforts to restore legitimacy in Yemen and prevent the Houthis from taking over the country. Feierstein said that Washington supports the Saudi-led Coalition’s goal to implement United Nations Security Council resolution 2216 on Yemen. Secretary General of the Gulf Cooperation Council Dr. Abdullatif bin Rashid Al-Zayani condemned Wednesday’s terrorist ballistic missile attack by the Houthis against the Saudi capital Riyadh and cities of Jizan and Najran. The continuation of such attacks demonstrates the militias’ insistence to threaten the security of Saudi Arabia and their rejection of regional and international efforts to stop the bloodshed and achieve peace in Yemen. He hailed the efficiency of the Royal Saudi Air Defense Forces, which intercepted and destroyed the missiles before they reached their targets. He called on the international community to condemn these hostile acts that violate international laws and conventions, urging the Security Council to implement its resolutions on Yemen, including resolution 2216. Britain also expressed deep concern after the ballistic missile attacks by the Houthis against Saudi cities, stressing that it stands with Saudi Arabia against these serious threats. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said in a statement: "We will call on the UN to investigate how ballistic weapons reach Yemen in violation of Security Council resolutions." "Those responsible for firing these missiles and their supporters must stop these provocative acts and return to political dialogue to ensure an end to the conflict in Yemen for the benefit of the Yemeni people and ensure the security of the region," he added. Egypt strongly condemned the Houthi attack. The Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday that it fully support Saudi Arabia in confronting all who attempt to destabilize or threaten its security.

Al Arabiya has learned on Tuesday from sources that Arab Coalition forces were able to shoot down two Iranian drone aircrafts in the Midi district of Hajjah province. The Houthi militias reportedly launched the Iran-made drones a day earlier to the positions of the national army and coalition in the recently liberated directorate of Midi in order to surveil and reveal military positions. Advertisement Sources said that the Houthi militias tried to repeat the operation Monday morning but did not succeed, after a second one was shot down by army and coalition forces.

News article:
Al Mukalla: UAE-backed Yemeni Security Belt forces have killed two senior Al Qaida militants in the southern province of Abyan, scoring another victory in the battle against the militant group. Hassan Basaria and Murad Doubali were killed in an intense gun battle after refusing to surrender in Al Wadhea district, the birthplace of Yemen’s president Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi, the security unit said in a statement. They had been involved in plotting attacks against local security forces. Al Qaida has largely failed to resurface in their former strongholds as thousands of Yemeni troops, trained and armed by the UAE military in Yemen, assert control over key urban and rural areas in southern Yemen. Meanwhile, Saudi-led coalition fighter jets have killed an Al Houthi navy commander responsible for smuggling arms and staging attacks against ships in the Red Sea. Yemen Defence Ministry said on Wednesday that coalition fighter jets targeted a gathering of Al Houthi militants in the western port city of Hodeida, killing Mansour Ahmad Al Sa’adi and a number of his associates. Al Sa’adi was described as an important Al Houthi smuggler and a commander of the movement’s navy soldiers who plotted attacks against military and humanitarian ships from the USA, UAE and Saudi Arabia. The death of Al Sa’adi comes as the Iran-backed militia officially mourned the death of brigadier Nasser Al Qubari, a former Republican Guard, killed in an air strike by the coalition jets on Wednesday. Precision air raids by the coalition’s fighter jets have killed dozens of Al Houthi commanders, including military aides to Al Houthi leader, Abdul Malik Al Houthi. The Saudi-led coalition has intensified their ground and air offensive in the province of Hodeida in an attempt to cut off the remaining smuggling routes on the Red Sea under Al Houthi control. Meanwhile, Yemen’s Defence Ministry mourned the death of Colonel Ali Abdullah Al Suaidi, the commander of Brigade 159, who was killed in clashes with Al Houthi militants on Al Abadia battlefield, east of the central province of Baydha. Another pro-government field commander, Mohammad Jawas, was killed after attacking Al Houthi-controlled sites in Al Shareja, north of Lahj province. The Defence Ministry said coalition fighter jets carried out dozens of air strikes in Taiz and Serwah, Baydha and Sa’ada, striking Al Houthi military equipment and gatherings and killing dozens of militants. The coalition massive air support is credited for turning the tide of the current war in favour of government forces. The Saudi-led Arab coalition entered the Yemeni war in 2015 just months after an Al Houthi coup forced internationally-recognised Yemeni president Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi out of power. He later was able to escape house arrest and flee to Aden where he temporarily shifted government headquarters. Since then, the coalition has gained back 86 per cent of Yemeni territory but major population centres still remain under Al Houthi control. Saudi Arabia and the US have accused Iran of illegally smuggling weapons into Yemen to sustain Al Houthi war efforts. In December, one such Iranian-made ballistic missile was fired towards Riyadh for the first time in the three-year war. Although it was intercepted, Riyadh called it an ‘act of war’. The war has cost the lives of thousands of Yemenis and pushed the Arab world’s poorest country to the brink of famine. The latest government push seeks to take advantage of cracks in the awkward Al Houthi alliance with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s supporters. Saleh ruled Yemen for more than three decades until he was forced to resign following an Arab Spring uprising in 2011. He remained in the country, however, and continued to wield power from behind the scenes. In 2014, his forces allied with Al Houthi militia, despite the fact that as president he had gone to war with them. There had been simmering tensions between the two awkward allies in past months that boiled over in December when Saleh suggested he would cooperate with Hadi — he was assassinated shortly after. Since then senior members of Saleh’s party have either been executed or placed under house arrest by Al Houthis amid a draconion crackdown. The broken alliance between Al Houthis and forces loyal to Saleh appears to be permanent, which will help the Yemeni government and its backers in the Saudi-led coalition weaken their grip on the country given the reduction in manpower. In a recent meeting with New York Times editors, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman said that Al Houthis have become increasingly isolated politically. He dismissed the seven missiles Al Houthis fired at Saudi Arabia from Yemen on March 25 as “a last-ditch effort” that only showed they were weak. Saudi Arabia, he said, is now seeking to end the war through a political process, trying to divide Al Houthis and maintaining military pressure on them.

Saudi air defences intercepted a "ballistic missile" fired by Yemeni rebels at the kingdom's southern coastal city of Jizan, the Saudi-led coalition fighting the rebels said. It was the latest in a series of such attacks. "Saudi air defences intercepted a ballistic missile launched by the Huthi militias targeting Jizan," the coalition said in a statement. The Huthis, in a statement on their news outlet Al-Masirah, claimed that they fired a "Badr 1" ballistic missile and said it struck Jizan Regional Airport. AFP was unable to reach the airport for comment, but open-source flight information appeared to show flights arriving and departing on time. Saudi Arabia has since March 2015 led a coalition of Arab states fighting to roll back the Huthi rebels in Yemen and restore its neighbour's internationally-recognised government to power. Nearly 10,000 people have since been killed in the conflict, in what the United Nations has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis. In March, an Egyptian labourer became the first known fatality in a rebel missile attack on the Saudi capital. Saudi Arabia accuses its rival Iran of smuggling missiles to the Huthis -- a charge Tehran denies.

Riyadh (AFP) - Saudi air defences on Sunday intercepted a ballistic missile fired by Yemeni rebels at the kingdom's southern border city of Najran, which set a farm ablaze, state media said. "Saudi forces were able to intercept (the missile)," the Saudi Press Agency said, citing the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed Huthi rebels. "But the shrapnel scattered over residential areas and caused a fire at a farm belonging to a citizen, without causing any injuries." The missile was launched from Saada, the Huthi stronghold in northern Yemen, the coalition was cited as saying. The coalition said another missile crashed in a Saudi desert on Sunday, without specifying a location, adding it caused no damage. Sunday's strikes are the latest in a series of rebel bombardments on Saudi territory. Saudi forces said they intercepted a rebel ballistic missile targeting kingdom's southern coastal city of Jizan on Friday, the second such strike in the area in over a week. Earlier this month, Saudi forces said they intercepted rebel ballistic missiles fired at Riyadh and the south of the kingdom, where two drones were also shot down.

News article:
Riyadh (AFP) - Saudi air defences on Sunday intercepted a ballistic missile fired by Yemeni rebels at the kingdom's southern border city of Najran, which set a farm ablaze, state media said. "Saudi forces were able to intercept (the missile)," the Saudi Press Agency said, citing the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed Huthi rebels. "But the shrapnel scattered over residential areas and caused a fire at a farm belonging to a citizen, without causing any injuries." The missile was launched from Saada, the Huthi stronghold in northern Yemen, the coalition was cited as saying. The coalition said another missile crashed in a Saudi desert on Sunday, without specifying a location, adding it caused no damage. Sunday's strikes are the latest in a series of rebel bombardments on Saudi territory. Saudi forces said they intercepted a rebel ballistic missile targeting kingdom's southern coastal city of Jizan on Friday, the second such strike in the area in over a week. Earlier this month, Saudi forces said they intercepted rebel ballistic missiles fired at Riyadh and the south of the kingdom, where two drones were also shot down. Saudi Arabia has since March 2015 led a coalition of Arab states fighting to roll back the Huthis in Yemen and restore its neighbour's internationally recognised government to power. Nearly 10,000 people have since been killed in the conflict, in what the United Nations has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis. In March, an Egyptian labourer became the first known fatality in a rebel missile attack on the Saudi capital. Saudi Arabia accuses its arch-rival Iran of smuggling missiles to the Huthis -- a charge Tehran denies.

News article:
Saudi air defences on Sunday intercepted another ballistic missile fired by Yemeni rebels at the kingdom's southern border city of Najran, as pro-government forces inflicted heavy losses on the rebels in south-west Yemen. "Saudi forces were able to intercept [the missile]," the Saudi Press Agency said, citing the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels. "But the shrapnel scattered over residential areas and caused a fire at a farm belonging to a citizen, without causing any injuries." The missile was launched from Saada, the Houthi stronghold in northern Yemen, the coalition was cited as saying. The coalition said another missile crashed in a Saudi desert on Sunday, without specifying a location, adding that it caused no damage. _______________ Read more: [ Saudi intercepts a Houthi missile over Riyadh ] [ Saudis shoot down drone in Riyadh ] _______________ Meanwhile, pro-government troops backed by the UAE Armed Forces, a key member of the coalition, registered a fourth consecutive day of gains against the rebels in Taez province on the Red Sea coast. The rapid advances in the direction of the port city of Mokha are significant steps towards breaking the rebel siege of Taez city 50 kilometres away, a source in the Yemeni National Resistance Forces told UAE state news agency Wam. Led by Brig Gen Tarek Mohamed Abdullah Saleh, the Yemeni National Resistance Forces have been joined by thousands of Yemeni nationals in recent days and are being supported by the Southern Resistance and Tahami Movement as well as UAE Forces, Wam said. The Houthi rebels have stepped up attacks on Saudi Arabia as their forces come under increasing pressure in Yemen, with Sunday's missile attacks the latest in a series of rebel bombardments of Saudi territory. Saudi forces said they intercepted a rebel ballistic missile targeting kingdom's southern coastal city of Jazan on Friday, the second such strike in the area in over a week. Earlier this month, Saudi forces said they intercepted rebel ballistic missiles fired at Riyadh and the south of the kingdom, where two drones were also shot down. Saudi Arabia has since March 2015 led a coalition of Arab states fighting to roll back the Houthis in Yemen and restore its neighbour's internationally recognised government to power. Nearly 10,000 people have since been killed in the conflict, in what the United Nations has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis. In March, an Egyptian labourer became the first known fatality in a rebel missile attack on the Saudi capital. Saudi Arabia accuses its arch-rival Iran of smuggling missiles to the Houthis – a charge Tehran denies.

(Adds Houthi leader speech) By Noah Browning DUBAI, April 28 (Reuters) - Yemen's Houthi movement fired ballistic missiles at what it called "economic and vital targets" in the southern Saudi province of Jizan on Saturday, and Saudi authorities said a man was killed by debris from the projectiles. The attack appeared to be retaliation promised by Yemen's dominant political faction in a war there as thousands attended a funeral in the Houthi-run capital Sanaa for a top Houthi official killed in a Saudi-led air strike last week. Eyewitnesses in Sanaa reported Saudi-led air raids on Saturday near the downtown rally for the burial of Saleh al-Samad, the president of the political body that runs Houthi-controlled northern Yemen. There were no reports of casualties. The Houthis said they launched eight ballistic missiles at "economic and vital targets" in Saudi's Jizan province on Saturday. Riyadh said it intercepted four of the projectiles. Jizan civil defence spokesman Colonel Yahya Abdullah Al-Qahtani said on Arabiya TV that the Saudi man was killed by "falling fragments of military projectiles." A picture accompanying the Arabiya TV report appeared to show the outside of a civilian home pockmarked by shrapnel. The two sides in Yemen have fought to a stalemate after more than three years of war. A Saudi-led military coalition is trying to restore Yemen's internationally recognised government that was forced into exile after the Houthis took over large parts of the country in 2014 and seized the capital Sanaa. Saudi and other warplanes from the mostly Gulf Arab alliance have carried out thousands of air strikes, repeatedly hitting markets, hospitals and other civilian targets, killing hundreds of civilians. The coalition says it does not target civilians. In a televised speech, Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi vowed that the death of Samad -- a relative moderate who helped oversee political and administrative duties while the Houthi military wing pursued fighting -- would not split its ranks. "They anticipated that this crime would break the spirit of the Yemeni people ... Our enemies have fantasized that the assassination of the president will lead to disagreements within the Ansarullah (Houthis). All this is a mirage and illusions." The Houthis have fired more than 100 ballistic missiles into the kingdom, causing few casualties, but fuelling accusations by their adversaries and the United States that Iran is providing the missiles to their Houthi allies. Tehran and the Houthis deny the accusation. The group says it is fighting for Yemen's sovereignty against a Western-backed plot to dominate the country.

News article:
Al Mukalla: Yemen’s army and Saudi-led coalition explosive sappers have defused more than 300,000 landmines and booby traps planted by the Iran-backed Al Houthis who suffer heavy setbacks on the battlefields. The director of Yemen’s Mine Action Centre, Brigadier General Amen Al Oukaili, said Al Houthis have planted more than 500,000 landmines before fleeing areas liberated by Yemeni troops during the course of the three-year war. Remaining landmines continue to pose a grave threat to civilians who return to their homes. 440 Yemenis have been killed by landmines The aim of leaving behind the landmines is to slow down government forces as they advance on the battlefield. Yemen’s under-secretary of the ministry of human rights, Majed Fadhael, was quoted by Saudi news agency as saying that Al Houthi-planted landmines have killed 440 people, mainly women and children and wounded more than 540 others. Last year, Human Right Watch criticised Al Houthis for using landmines which are banned because of their indiscrminate killing and maiming of civilians. Many Yemenis fear to return home because of the fear of stepping on a landmine which has kept the numbers of internally-displaced Yemenis high. On Tuesday, Al Masdar Online news site reported a woman and her child were killed when a landmine planted by Al Houthis exploded in the southern city of Taiz. Sabah Sultan, 30 and her child Ali Mouath, 6, were getting water from a water tanker when a landmine that was planted behind the tanker exploded, killing them instantly in Hathran region, west of Taiz. Meanwhile, on the battlefield, fighter jets from the Saudi-led coalition escalated attacks against Al Houthi targets, west of Taiz, in support of thousands of army troops, led Tareq Mohammad Abdullah Saleh. Yemen’s Defense Ministry said the coalition’s fighter jets bombed Al Houthi military equipment and gatherings in areas east of the Red Sea Mokha town as Tareq’s forces push deeper into Al Houthis’ shrinking territories in Taiz. The ministry said the air strikes killed and wounded a number of Al Houthis and enabled ground forces to make limited advances in their push towards Al Bareh town. Heavy fighting also broke out on Wednesday in the northeastern province of Saada, Al Houthis’ main heartland, where government forces made fresh gains that brought them closer to reaching Marran region, the birthplace of Al Houthi movement founder Hussain Al Houthi. Local military commanders say government forces are battling Al Houthis on five fronts in Saada in a bid to cut off supply lines from and to Saada and erode their military power that protects Saada. The Saudi-led Arab coalition entered the Yemeni war in 2015 just months after an Al Houthi coup forced internationally-recognised Yemeni president Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi out of power. 540 Yemenis wounded by landmines He later was able to escape house arrest and flee to Aden where he temporarily shifted government headquarters. Since then, the coalition has gained back 86 per cent of Yemeni territory but major population centres still remain under Al Houthi control. Saudi Arabia and the US have accused Iran of illegally smuggling weapons into Yemen to sustain Al Houthi war efforts. In December, one such Iranian-made ballistic missile was fired towards Riyadh for the first time in the three-year war. Although it was intercepted, Riyadh called it an ‘act of war’. The war has cost the lives of thousands of Yemenis and pushed the Arab world’s poorest country to the brink of famine. The latest government push seeks to take advantage of cracks in the awkward Al Houthi alliance with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s supporters. Saleh ruled Yemen for more than three decades until he was forced to resign following an Arab Spring uprising in 2011. He remained in the country, however, and continued to wield power from behind the scenes. In 2014, his forces allied with Al Houthi militia, despite the fact that as president he had gone to war with them. There had been simmering tensions between the two awkward allies in past months that boiled over in December when Saleh suggested he would cooperate with Hadi — he was assassinated shortly after. Since then senior members of Saleh’s party have either been executed or placed under house arrest by Al Houthis amid a draconion crackdown. The broken alliance between Al Houthis and forces loyal to Saleh appears to be permanent, which will help the Yemeni government and its backers in the Saudi-led coalition weaken their grip on the country given the reduction in manpower. In a recent meeting with New York Times editors, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman said that Al Houthis have become increasingly isolated politically. He dismissed the seven missiles Al Houthis fired at Saudi Arabia from Yemen on March 25 as “a last-ditch effort” that only showed they were weak. Saudi Arabia, he said, is now seeking to end the war through a political process, trying to divide Al Houthis and maintaining military pressure on them.

The Saudi-led coalition, consisting mostly of Persian Gulf countries, has been carrying out airstrikes against the Houthi movement since March 2015, when the rebels conducted a takeover in the country, which resulted in President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi fleeing Sanaa, Yemen's capital. The Houthis, allied with ex-President Ali Abdullah Saleh, clashed with Hadi's forces, with each side claiming to be the official government. The coalition led by Saudi Arabia denounced the Houthi takeover as unconstitutional and since then has been attempting to restore the government of Hadi. READ MORE: Saudi Air Defenses Down Yemeni Rebel Missile — Reports The military conflict in Yemen has further escalated since November 2017 when Saudi Arabia accused Iran of supplying the Houthi rebels with ballistic missiles and imposed a blockade on Yemen in order to prevent the transfer of military goods to the Houthis. While Tehran has made no secret of its political support for the Shiite movement, it has repeatedly denied rumors of arming the Yemeni rebels. While Riyadh has insisted that the closure of Yemen's ground, air and sea ports by the Saudi-led coalition forces would not interfere with food deliveries to the country, the UN said that the blockade distorted the supply of humanitarian aid, which along with the destruction of the country's infrastructure, as a result of the fighting, has led to a massive famine.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Saudi media said Wednesday that ballistic missiles were fired by Yemen’s Shiite rebels at the Saudi capital, Riyadh.

Manama: A ballistic missile launched by Yemen’s Iran-backed Al Houthis at the southern Saudi port city of Jazan has fallen on an uninhabited desert terrain, the spokesperson for the Arab Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen, has said. Colonel Turki Al Maliki, said that at 10.18am on Monday, the Saudi Royal Air Defence Forces started tracking a ballistic missile launched by Al Houthi militia. The missile was launched from Saada governorate to deliberately target civilian objects, he added. “Launching a ballistic missile towards densely populated areas by the Iranian-backed Houthi militia is yet another violation of international humanitarian law, and proves continued Iranian involvement in the Yemeni conflict,” he said in a statement relayed by the Riyadh-based Centre for International Communication. “Iran is supporting Al Houthis with advanced military capabilities, in a clear and explicit violation of UN Security Council Resolutions 2216 and 2231, in order to threaten the security of Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, and the stability of the international order.”

(Adds coalition statement, context) RIYADH, May 14 (Reuters) - Yemen's armed Houthi movement launched a ballistic missile at a Saudi Aramco facility in Saudi Arabia's southwestern Jizan province on Monday, the group's al-Masirah TV reported, but a Saudi-led coalition said the rocket fell in the open desert. The Houthis, an Iran-allied group that holds much of Yemen including the capital Sanaa, have fired a series of missiles into the kingdom in recent months, part of a three-year-old conflict in Yemen widely seen as a proxy battle between Saudi Arabia and Iran. A U.S.-backed military alliance intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 to fight against the Houthis on behalf of the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour al-Hadi, who lives in exile in Riyadh. Iran and the Houthis dismiss Saudi accusations that Tehran arms the group. Coalition spokesman Turki al-Malki said Saudi air defence forces had tracked the rocket but that it landed in an uninhabited area, according to a report from the official Saudi Press Agency. The Houthis fired a salvo of missiles at Riyadh last week, with one falling short of the capital and another intercepted by Saudi air defence forces, Malki said at the time.

Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi – Reuters CAIRO – 2 April 2018: Yemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi expressed his wishes of progress and success in a cable sent on Monday to his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fatah al-Sisi after winning a second term. Hadi asserted that his country shares deep-rooted and strong relations with Egypt, expressing his hope for more cooperation in various fields. In a press conference on Monday, the National Election Authority announced the victory of Sisi over Ghad Party Chairman Moussa Moustafa Moussa in the 2018 presidential election. President Sisi garnered 97.08 percent of valid votes in the presidential election last week, where more than 21.8 million people voted for him. His hardly-known competitor, Moussa Moustafa Moussa, received 656,534 votes, making up 2.9 percent of the valid ballots. The turnout stood at 24,254,152 voters, representing 41 percent of 50,078,138 registered voters. In a televised speech after winning the election, Sisi pledged to keep his promise in serving the nation and thanked all Egyptians for trusting him to lead the country. “With complete honesty, I pledge to keep my promise with you and to dedicate myself to spare no efforts for our great nation,” Sisi said on Monday. The national unity that was shown during the election was strong evidence of Egypt’s solid power against those who wanted to undermine the country, he added. Much like the 2014 election, when Sisi competed against well-known politician Hamdeen Sabahy, invalid votes ranked second in the poll. In the 2014 vote, 23.4 million people voted for Sisi, invalid votes accounted for one million ballots, and Sabahy won 740,000 votes. In 2018, invalid votes made up 7.27 percent of the total votes, accounting for 1.762 million ballots. If invalid votes are not excluded from the result, Sisi's share of the total votes would be 90 percent.

News article:
U.N. peacekeepers hold position at the MONUSCO base after dispersing demonstrators in Mavivi near Beni in North Kivu province October 22, 2014. REUTERS CAIRO – 5 April 2018: United Nations thanked Egypt on Wednesday evening for its cooperation with the UN by participating in peacekeeping missions. “Since 1948, more than a million women and men have served in the UN peacekeeping forces,” the UN wrote on Twitter, adding that Egypt participates in the peacekeeping missions with over 3,200 troops and policemen. The UN figures, as of February 28, 2018, show that Egypt provides UN peacekeeping forces with 2,293 troops, 775 policemen, 56 military experts and 63 state officers. The UN Peacekeeping forces are tasked with monitoring peace processes and agreements in post-conflict areas. Peacekeepers are deployed in parts of the Middle East, Mali, Pakistan, South Sudan, Lebanon, Darfur and Golan. The UN peacekeeping personnel consist of more than 90,000 military personnel, 13,000 police officers, in addition to more than 15,000 civilians, according to the UN.

Source: Xinhua| 2018-04-13 03:00:02|Editor: yan Video Player Close CAIRO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi stressed on Thursday Egypt's keenness to promote economic and trade cooperation with Portugal. Sisi's comments came during his meeting with visiting Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa in Cairo. "Sisi lauded historic relations binding the two countries, expressing commitment to pushing forward bilateral relations," Presidential spokesman Bassam Rady said in a statement. Rady noted that President Sisi held a session of talks with de Sousa, who is currently on a three-day visit to Egypt, adding that the session was followed by an expanded meeting grouping the delegations of both countries. The two leaders urged accelerating the implementation of what was agreed upon by the two sides during the committee meetings in October 2017, Rady said, adding that Sisi updated his Portuguese counterpart on economic reforms in Egypt and promising investments in the under-construction mega national projects. Sisi said regional and international circumstances and geographic closeness between Egypt and Portugal require more cooperation and coordination to address current serious and complicated challenges and threats that cannot be faced separately like terrorism, organized crime and illegal migration. The Egyptian spokesman said Sisi's talks with the Portuguese president covered the situation in Libya and Syria and efforts to fight terrorism and dry up its funding sources. For his part, the Portuguese president lauded progress realized by Egypt in its anti-terror war.

Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry is set to fly to Burundi on Tuesday to work towards boosting relations between the two countries, a statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry said on Monday. Egypt's foreign ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid said Shoukry is heading to Burundi's capital of Bujumbura to review joint ties and to discuss issues of bilateral interest. "The visit comes in the framework of Egypt's special interest to boost and support relations with Nile Basin countries and those of the African continent generally," the statement said. The Egyptian foreign minister will meet Burundi's President Pierre Nkurunziza, as well as other officials including his Burundian counterpart, and will inaugurate a number of development projects granted by Egypt to the African country under the framework of the Egyptian Agency of Partnership for Development. Abu Zeid noted that Egypt was the first Arab country to establish diplomatic relations with Burundi following the latter's independence in 1962, and added that Egypt has provided aid and training towards development projects for their Burundian brothers, as well as support for Burundi's security and stability during Egypt's membership in the United Nations Security Council in 2016 and 2017. According to the spokesman, around 150 Burundian trainees participated in training workshops during 2017 in the fields of health, medicine, agriculture, military and police training and combating terrorism. Egypt has also provided medical aid to Burundi in the past, he pointed out. The issue of the Nile's water and other matters related to African relations will be discussed by Shoukry and his counterparts, according to Abu Zeid. Burundi is among other Nile basin countries, including Ethiopia, which have previously said that they want to re-negotiate all treaties related to the Nile, including the 1929 Nile Waters Agreement, which gives Egypt the right to veto Nile development projects that might threaten its water share. Burundi is one of the basin countries expected to pass the Cooperation Framework Agreement on the Nile, which will "promote integrated management, sustainable development, and harmonious utilization of the water resources of the basin, as well as its conservation and protection for the benefit of present and future generations," according to the text of the agreement.

President Abdel-Fattah El Sisi issued on Thursday a decree approving an agreement on scientific and technical cooperation between Egypt and the European Union (EU). The deal sets out the terms and conditions for Egypt's participation in the Partnership on Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA), an EU joint programme focusing on the development and application of solutions for food systems and water resources in the Mediterranean basin. The agreement was signed in October 2017 in Brussels. According to the agreement, Egypt will become one of the 19 member states around the Mediterranean that are working to develop innovative solutions for sustainable water management and food production, which remain major challenges in the region. The main objective of the 10-year initiative (2018-2028), is to devise new Research & Innovation approaches to improve water availability and sustainable agriculture production in a region heavily distressed by climate change, urbanisation and population growth.

“There is much to gain, in terms of access to new sources of energy and market opportunities, for European and Egyptian citizens and businesses alike," says EU Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete The European Union is set to sign a strategic partnership agreement on energy with Egypt, 22-24 April, a press release by the European Commission read. European Climate and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete will arrive to Cairo Sunday and is expected to meet Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi. “Egypt is becoming an upcoming important gas and electricity hub that can provide energy security for the EU and for the entire region,” said Cañete in the statement. On behalf of the Commission, Cañete is expected to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Egyptian government that will last from 2018 to 2022. The memorandum highlights six priorities in the context of the EU-Egypt partnership. These priorities include, according to the statement, “further assistance to the development of the oil and gas sector,” “continued support to electricity sector reforms,” and “development of the energy hub.” The statement also references “Further assistance with joint measures and projects in the field of renewable energy,” “additional support on energy efficiency strategies, policies and measures, across various sectors,” and “cooperation in technological, scientific and industrial areas across the energy field.” During his visit, Cañete is expected to meet with Prime Minister Sherif Ismail, Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy Mohamed Shaker, and Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Tarek El-Molla. Cañete is also expected to meet with European energy companies and launch the EU-Egypt Sustainable Energy Business Forum & Exhibition. The two-day trip will include a site visit to Egypt’s Zohr gas field, discovered in 2015 and estimated to contain 30 trillion cubic feet of gas. The gas filed is located near Egypt’s Suez Canal city of Port Said. “There is much to gain, in terms of access to new sources of energy and market opportunities, for European and Egyptian citizens and businesses alike. The EU stands ready to support Egypt in its energy market reforms and to boost sustainable energy investment,” said Cañete.

Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry on Thursday stressed Egypt's support for a resolution to the political crisis in South Sudan while attending the opening session of the South Sudan Liberation Movement's (SPLM) National Liberation Council in Juba, according to Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid. The opening session, which convenes from 3-5 May, was attended by President of Uganda Yoweri Musevenias well as South Sudanese President Salva Kiir. Abu Zeid explained that the meetings in Juba are aimed at finding an agreed solution to the current crisis in South Sudan. He added that Egypt's vision is based on the country's need to resolve the crises through negotiations while preserving South Sudan's sovereignty and regional integration. In a speech, Shoukry, who is attending on behalf of the Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, highlighted the commitment of the guarantor states to the Arusha Agreement to achieve peace, stability and prosperity for the people of Southern Sudan. "Egypt will continue its efforts to support the brothers in South Sudan in order to achieve peace," said the Egyptian minister. He expressed his hopes that the council's discussions will contribute to reaching an agreement that includes all the parties in South Sudan, as well as the success of the National Dialogue Committee in its efforts to achieve internal consensus. The 12-page Arusha agreement was signed in Tanzania in January 2015 by representatives from three conflicting factions of the SPLM party, outlining key steps towards a reunification of the party. The National Liberation Council is the second-highest level in the SPLM after its political bureau, and consists of 170 members as representatives of different states in South Sudan, according to Abu Zeid. Meanwhile, Shoukry pointed out that South Sudan can not afford to miss another opportunity to achieve peace and stability after years of its people's suffering, and praised President Kiir's ongoing efforts to achieve security and peace in the country. Shoukry also stressed Egypt's continuing role to support the political and economic stability of South Sudan. "Egypt has faith in justice and peace which will be meeting the rights of all parties and which could only be achieved through the implementation of the rule of law," Abu Zeid's statement read. During the session, Shoukry highlighted the historical relations between the two countries in the political, economic, social and cultural fields, as well as joint coordination at the bilateral, regional and international levels. The top diplomat said that this meeting is the best proof of the strong ties between Juba and Cairo. Search Keywords: Short link:

Granite sphinx of Taharqo, 25th Dynasty from a temple at Kawa. Now residing in the British Museum, London via Wikimedia commons/ Jon Bodsworth CAIRO – 7 May 2018: Sudanese author Abdel Aal Hemat called on the Egyptian government to start teaching the Nubian language as part of its educational curriculum in schools, saying that this language is considered part of the historical heritage of the culture of Sudan and Egypt.“There is only one university in central Sudan that teaches the Nubian language; no other universities or schools teach it in all of Africa, which will affect the existence and significance of Nubian culture and history on the long term,” Hemat said in statements to media outlets on Monday.By 2020, some of the schools in North Sudan will start teaching this language as part of its educational curriculum, according to Hemat; however, he also wishes that Egypt takes a similar decision to protect the language, which has shaped a huge part of Egyptian and Sudanese history.He added that the Nubian language consists of 24 characters; each one needs at least four hours of good practice and learning to be perfectly understood and fluently spoken. “This language has a 5,000-year-old history. It’s one of the oldest languages ever spoken,” Hemat affirmed.Nubia currently is a region located between Aswan in southern Egypt and Khartoum in central Sudan. In the past, several old civilizations lived and thrived in this area, including the Kerma and Kush kingdoms, which were described by UNESCO as “great powers” that ruled Nubia.“Taharqa” was a Kush-Nubian pharaoh who ruled ancient Egypt as part of the 25th Dynasty and established several pillars inside the Karnak Temple complex, but only one pillar from his civilization has survived until now.Nubian people are trying to preserve their culture as much as possible by passing the language on to their children to prevent it from being lost; however, some Nubian people complain that there are no real measures being taken to preserve and guarantee the existence of this language.The Nubian language played a significant role during the 1973 October War as a secret code for the Egyptian army.

DP World, the world’s fourth-biggest ports operator, signed a preliminary agreement with Egypt’s Suez Canal Authority and the Egyptian government to jointly develop a new inland container depot near Cairo as part of efforts to spur the North African country’s economic growth. “Developing trade infrastructure to improve hinterland access for goods bound for Africa’s growing economic needs is essential,” said DP World group chairman and chief executive, Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem. The Egyptian government is working to promote sustainable economic development for the country through a structural reform programme, funded in part through a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), awarded in 2016 when Egypt was grappling with a period of slow growth. The US-based lender projects stronger GDP growth for Egypt over the next two years in the context of the IMF-funded reforms, at 5.2 per cent in 2018 and 5.5 per cent in 2019. Under this week’s agreement, DP World, Egypt’s Holding Company for Maritime and Land Transport, and the Suez Canal Authority aim to develop the new container depot in Egypt’s 6th of October City, a satellite town in the Giza Governorate, part of the urban area of Cairo. ________________ Read more: [ IMF encourages Egypt to deepen economic reforms, pursue job creation ] [ Egypt seeks foreign investors for Red Sea projects as it targets pre-2011 tourism levels in 3 years ] [ Exclusive: DP World to maintain about $1bn capex for next three years ] ________________ The three partners, led by DP World, will bid for the government contract for the project later this year, the ports operator said on Monday. The proposed depot is intended to “increase the flow of cargo between ships and major land transportation networks in the country, creating a central distribution point”. The project – the result of a previous cooperation agreement between the three companies – will serve trade in Egypt by linking inland and marine ports, said Mohamed Ahmad Ibrahim Youssef, chairman of the Company of Maritime and Land Transport. “This partnership is aligned with Egypt’s strategy for sustainable development and the [government ministries’] policy to increase activities and investments of its companies in projects that raise developmental levels, create jobs for Egyptian youth and increase the profits of Egyptian companies to fuel local GDP,” the chairman said. UAE-based DP World already has a presence in Egypt – it has been operating the Sokhna Port for the past decade. Last year it signed a partnership agreement with the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone) to form a joint venture company to develop a special economic free zone in Ain Sokhna. Under the agreement, SCZone is to hold 51 per cent of shares in the new vehicle and DP World the remaining 49 per cent.

CAIRO – 8 May 2018: Presidency Spokesperson Bassam Radi on Tuesday affirmed that Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is one of the prominent and experienced African leaderships in the continent. Radi added, during his interview with TV host Tamer Amin on Al-Hayah satellite channel, that Museveni’s visit to Egypt comes within the framework of Egyptian-African relations, especially with countries of the Nile Basin. Ugandan President Museveni visited Egypt on Tuesday upon President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi’s invitation for a joint press conference that addressed countering terrorism, investment and establishing a new navigational course between African countries through the Nile River. Museveni said that he looks at President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi as a “warrior” who defends freedoms. He also added that he is glad to see Egypt now enjoying a stable and progressive leadership. Radi clarified that the international and regional circumstances during the 70s and 80s were the reason behind the sit-back in Egypt’s relations with the African continent, however, president Sisi is currently working on retrieving these relations. It is pertinent to mention that Egypt was elected by African leaders in Addis Ababa to head the African Union's upcoming 31st session in 2019. The 30th African Union Summit kicked off Sunday under the theme of “Winning the fight against corruption: A sustainable path to Africa’s transformation” in Addis Ababa with the participation of President Sisi as well as 54 African leaders.

News article:
CAIRO – 9 May 2018: The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) expects growth in Egypt to record 5.3 percent in 2018 and 5.5 percent in 2019, up from 4.3 percent in 2016 and 4.2 percent in 2017, with an increase of 0.8 percent.This came at the Bank’s new Regional Economic Prospects report that includes the predictions of the economic trends in 37 economies across three continents, from Estonia to Egypt and from Morocco to Mongolia.The report expected a growth rate of 3.3 percent in 2018 in all 37 countries to record 3.2 percent in 2019.“The economic momentum remained strong but that growth might now have peaked,” the report clarified.The EBRD’s Chief Economist, Sergei Guriev, said that the lower productivity growth reflected the fact that most EBRD economies had exhausted the growth levers that had delivered rapid expansion until the onset of the crisis.“In order to develop new sources of growth, these countries need to carry out structural reforms of product, capital and labour markets. They need to improve governance, promote integration into the global economy, and invest in human capital and sustainable infrastructure,” Guriev said.“The good news is that the current recovery provides a solid window of opportunity for such reforms,” he added.The bank depended on several risks to determine its forecasts, including: corporate debt levels, stock market levels, persistent security threats and geopolitical tensions as well as a high degree of concentration of sources of global growth.Planning Minister Hala el-Saeed said that Egypt’s growth rate pushed the government and international organizations to raise their expectations of the economic growth to 5.3 percent currently, up from 4.6 percent in 2017/2018 before implementing the reform program.Egypt had embarked on a bold economic reform program that included the introduction of taxes, such as the value-added tax (VAT), and cutting energy subsidies, all with the aim of trimming the budget deficit.The state floated its currency in November 2016; losing 50 percent of its value, as part of the economic reform program.She added that Egypt is targeting a growth rate of 5.8 percent, to be accelerated gradually to 8 percent by 2021/2022.HC Securities & Investment (HC) expects Egypt’s gross domestic product (GDP) to reach 5.3 percent in 2017/2018 and 6 percent in 2018/2019, reaching 6.2 percent in 2019/2020.The International Monetary Fund expected earlier that Egypt will record a GDP of 5.2 percent in the current fiscal year and to reach 5.5 percent next year, with an increase of 0.7 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively.The IMF further anticipated the GDP to record 6 percent in 2023.The IMF’s executive board approved in November 2016 a three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFT) loan to Egypt worth $12 billion to support its economic reform program.

During the launching ceremony of the Egyptian Mexican Business Council in Cairo - Egypt Today CAIRO – 9 May 2018: The Mexico-Egypt Business Council was launched on Tuesday to activate cooperation between Egypt and Mexico. The council aims at deepening communication and partnership among companies in both countries, as well as discovering new cooperation opportunities, as it consists of companies that are already operating in both countries and others that are interested in starting their business in each. The participating companies in the business council are CEMEX, Pico Energie, Aqualia, Swede Electrometer, Kidzania, Rohrbomben and Polyimeros Michecanos, which will start its business in Egypt this year with a plastic products factory in Alexandria. The inauguration took place in the presence of Ahmed Anter, head of the Egyptian Commercial Service; Paulo Carreño, head of ProMexico; Ahmed el-Wakeel, president of the General Federation of Egyptian Chambers of Commerce; Jose Octavio Tripp, Mexico’s ambassador to Egypt; Reda Habib Ibrahim, deputy foreign affairs minister for the Americas; and Carlos Emilio Gonzalez, president of CEMEX Egypt. “The establishment of the Mexico-Egypt Business Council will represent a perfect platform of business community for both countries to discuss and explore new venues of trade and investment opportunities and to contribute in enhancing Egyptian-Mexican relations on all levels,” Ahmed Antar said. “The Mexico-Egypt relationship has developed to become one of the most solid ones in the region. Despite our most visible differences, Mexico and Egypt find common ground at diverse spheres,” CEO PROMÉXICO Paulo Carreno said. Carreno clarified that these diverse spheres range from culture and history, to economy and trade. For example, both countries are expected to be amongst the top 15 economies by 2050. For his part, Deputy Minister Reda Habib Ibrahim retained the commitment of the Egyptian government to work hand in hand for Egyptian and Mexican companies, mentioning that the newly established council is to facilitate trade and investments. Ahmed el-Wakeel said that Egypt is a land of opportunities in the fields of trade, logistics, agriculture, tourism and mega projects. “With a population over 100 million and an increasing per-capita income, Egypt has the largest domestic market in the region. Mexican companies will benefit from these characteristics, besides Egypt’s free-trade agreements, to increase their exports and trade to Egypt,” Wakeel added. Egypt is involved in international trade deals that came into action during the recent period. The Mercosur Agreement, which is a free-trade agreement signed by Egypt and Mercosur countries in 2010, includes immediate customs clearance for 63 percent of the exports of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay to Egypt. The Mercosur trade deal covers food, cars, auto parts and industrial supplies; it was signed by Egypt and Mercosur members in 2010, but only came into force in 2017. Another trade agreement that Egypt is involved in is the deal with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), which represents a free trade area with 19 member states stretching from Libya to Swaziland. COMESA was formed in December 1994, replacing a Preferential Trade Area, which had existed since 1981. The African Continental Free Trade Area is another agreement to ease the trade exchange between countries that have signed it, according to a scheduled timeline and not through an immediate activation of the agreement. The African Continental Free Trade Area is considered to be the biggest deal ever signed since the World Trade Organization was established; it was signed by 43 countries. In September 2017, Minister of Investment and International Cooperation Sahar Nasr discussed the establishment of the Mexico-Egypt Business Council with Mexican Ambassador to Egypt Jose Okatvio Trip to increase Mexico’s investments in Egypt.

President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi during the celebration of Egyptian family at Cairo International Stadium Monday March 19, 2017 - Photo courtesy of YouTube CAIRO – 13 May 2018: The relations between Egypt and Sudan can be described as “Holy”, Sudanese Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Information Ahmed Bilal Othman said in a press statement on Sunday. Othman said that the relation between the two countries is at its best as the communication channel is open between Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi and his Sudanese counterpart, Omar Hassan al-Bashir. Othman asserted the importance of the Egyptian-Sudanese cooperation to confront terrorism, assuring that exchange of security information is one of the main areas of cooperation between the two countries. "Egypt has been fighting terrorism for a long time and it has gone a long way in combating terrorism," he added. The two Nile River neighbors, Egypt and Sudan, have common bonds of history, language and religion. But, diplomatic relations have been frosty over the past years due to various reasons. In March, Sisi received Sudanese President Bashir where they both discussed the most important issues of mutual interest, as based on the agreement reached at the recent Addis Ababa tripartite summit. “I firmly stress on the long-standing and close relationship between our brotherly countries, promoted by the historical ties and common aspirations,” said the Sudanese president. The one-day visit of the Sudanese president also focused on tackling cooperation across various fields, as well as issues of joint interest. Egyptian relations with Sudan were recently strained over the border area of Halaib and Shalatin. On December 23, 2017, Sudan filed a complaint to the United Nations Secretariat to protest a maritime border demarcation deal between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, as the deal denotes the territory as Egyptian on maps. Halaib and Shalateen, or the Halaib Triangle, is an area of land measuring 20,580 square kilometers, located at the Egyptian-Sudanese border on the Red Sea coast. It is part of the Red Sea governorate and consists of three major towns – Halaib (which became a city in February 2014), Abu Ramad and Shalateen. The area belongs to Egypt politically and administratively, but has been one of the major sticking points in Egyptian-Sudanese relations since the demarcation of borders between the two countries were carried out during the British occupation of Egypt in 1899, at a time when Sudan was part of the Egyptian Kingdom. The issue re-emerged after Halaib and Shalateen declared electoral constituency in both Sudan and Egypt in 2014. Egypt affirmed that it has never concluded any international treaties or agreements, whether with the U.K. or Sudan, to give international status to the demarcation of administrative borders. The largest tribes that inhabit Hala'ib Triangle, including Rashaida, Alababdeh and Bashaira, rejected the Sudanese National Election Commission's decision that granted the people in Hala'ib the right to participate in Sudanese general elections. The three tribes asserted during the 6 October War victory celebration in 2009 that the area is 100 percent Egyptian.

The outgoing president of Paraguay on Thursday voiced support for relocating his country’s embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by mid-August. Speaking at an event marking 70 years of Israeli independence, Horacio Cartes expressed his willingness to move Paraguay’s mission to Israel’s capital before the end of his term, according to the ABC Color newspaper. The Israeli Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the report. Diplomatic officials told Channel 10 they were skeptical the outgoing president has the political support to advance an embassy move in under four months.

Other countries have also stated they will relocate their embassies. The president of the Czech Republic on Wednesday announced the beginning of a process that will move the country’s diplomatic missions from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though it remains unclear if and when Prague will actually open an embassy in the holy city. In private conversations, European and Israeli officials acknowledge that Milos Zeman’s announcement by no means prefaces the speedy relocation of the Czech embassy. On Thursday, Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dancilas and the head of the country’s Chamber of Deputies, Liviu Dragnea — both ardent proponents of the embassy move — were in Jerusalem for meetings with top government officials. Netanyahu, in his meeting with Dăncilăs, “expressed appreciation for the Romanian government’s approval of a draft decision on initiating the transfer of the Romanian Embassy to Jerusalem and welcomed the statements of the president of the parliament in support of the move,” according to a readout his office provided. The readout issued by Dancilas’ office spoke of “a framework launching the debate on relocating Romania’s embassy.” Advertisement But on Friday, Romania’s President Klaus Iohannis urged Dancilas to resign as prime minister over a secret memorandum adopted by the government last week with the aim of moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, saying he is opposed to the move and was not informed beforehand. AFP contributed to this report.

News article:
Asunción – Paraguayan president Horacio Cartes pledged to relocate his country’s embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem at a special celebratory event in Asunción to mark Israel’s 70th anniversary. Cartes said that he would like the move to take place before he leaves office in mid-August. Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon tweeted about the statement under the heading “good news.” But he later said that it was still unclear if plans to relocate the embassy were in the works. Already in March Paraguay indicated that it would relocate its embassy if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to visit. Last September Netanyahu became the first sitting prime minister to visit Latin America, but he had not stopped in Paraguay. In December U.S. President Donald Trump made a dramatic shift in US policy toward Jerusalem when he stated that it was the capital of Israel and that he would move the country’s embassy there. The relocated embassy is expected to open in May. On Friday, Trump said that he may come to Israel for that event. “I may go. I am very proud of it. Jerusalem has been a subject that has been promised for many, many years by presidents. They all made campaign promises but they never had the courage to carry it out. I carried it out.” Guatemala is the only other country who definitely plans to follow through by opening its embassy in the capital in May just a day or two after the US. A few other countries have spoken of doing so, but final approvals for such a move have not been given. This includes Czech Republic, Romania, Honduras and Paraguay. The Czech Republic does intend to open an honorary consulate in Jerusalem but not an official embassy. The international community has largely opposed any declaration of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, including west Jerusalem which is located within the pre-1967 lines. Still initially some 24 countries had embassies in west Jerusalem. But they relocated them after the Knesset’s passage in 1980 of the Jerusalem Law, which formally annexed east Jerusalem. The European Union has been particularly opposed to relocation of any embassies to Jerusalem, holding that this is something that should happen only after a final status agreement is reached for a two-state resolution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Both the Czech Republic and Romania are European Union states. They would be breaking with EU foreign policy should they relocate their embassies. The Czech Foreign Ministry explained last week, that it did not believe such a step was contrary to EU policy. “This step in no way prejudges the final agreement concerning Jerusalem, the same way as it is not being prejudged by diplomatic representations of several European countries that are seated in East Jerusalem,” it said. “The Czech Republic fully respects common policy of the European Union, which considers Jerusalem as the future capital of both the State of Israel and the future State of Palestine.” According to WAFA, the Palestinian news agency, EU foreign policy chief Fedrica Mogherini has said that none of the EU member states will relocate their embassies.

News article:
Guatemala's embassy in Israel moved on Monday to its new location in Jerusalem at the Malkha Technology Park. The official ceremony celebrating the move will take place on May 16, after the U.S. relocates its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, with the likely attendance of Guatemalean president Jimmy Morales. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu celebrated the move and welcomed Guatemala to Jerusalem. "I was moved to see the flag of Guatemala waving in Jerusalem in advance of the opening of the Guatemalan embassy later this month. Dear friends, welcome back to our eternal capital," Netanyahu said. Political sources in Romania, the Czech Republic, Paraguay and Honduras were quoted in recent months as saying that their countries are also considering moving their embassies to Jerusalem, but such a move has yet to take place. Jimmy Morales, president of Guatemala, first announced the move in a speech at the AIPAC policy conference in Washington this March, saying they would move their embassy two days after the U.S. moved theirs. "I'm sure many more countries will follow suit shortly," Morales said. Netanyahu met with Morales during AIPAC, where he thanked the Guatemalan president for recognizing Jerusalem as capital of Israel. Guatemala was one of seven states that voted with the U.S. in a UN vote to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, along with Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, and Togo.

Guatemala on Wednesday started to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, transferring furniture and other equipment into a yet-unfinished office in the capital’s Malha Technology Park. Earlier this week, the Guatemalan flag was raised outside the building. “I was moved to see the flag of Guatemala waving in Jerusalem in advance of the opening of the Guatemalan embassy later this month,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted. “Dear friends, welcome back to our eternal capital!” The Central American country’s president, Jimmy Morales, and foreign minister, Sandra Jovel, are scheduled to attend the embassy’s official opening on May 14. They will arrive in Israel a day earlier in order to attend a festive event at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem to celebrate the inaugurations of the new Guatemalan and US embassies.

Jerusalem – Paraguay will move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem by the end of May, a Paraguay government spokesman and the Israeli foreign ministry said on Monday, following the United States and Guatemala. “Paraguay President Horacio Cartes plans to come to Israel by the end of the month to open an embassy in Jerusalem,” Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said in a statement. A Paraguay government spokesman said Cartes was scheduling a trip to Israel to move the embassy on May 21 or May 22. The announcement comes one week before the United States embassy opens in Jerusalem on May 14 in accordance with President Donald Trump’s Dec. 6 recognition of the city as Israel’s capital. The U.S. move has delighted Israel and infuriated Palestinians. Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordanian control in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. The last round of peace talks on a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip collapsed in 2014. Israel says Jerusalem is its eternal and indivisible capital, while the Palestinians want the eastern part of the city as the capital of their own future independent state. In March Guatemala’s president, Jimmy Morales, said that his country would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on May 16, two days after the U.S. move. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in April that “at least half a dozen” countries were now “seriously discussing” following the U.S. lead, but he did not identify them. In December, 128 countries voted in a non-binding U.N. General Assembly resolution calling on the United States to drop its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Nine voted against, 35 abstained and 21 did not cast a vote. Paraguay’s embassy is currently located near Tel Aviv

Paraguay is set to become the third country, after the US and Guatemala, to transfer its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Israel said Monday. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Emmanuel Nahshon said Paraguay President Horacio Cartes will travel to Israel later this month to open the country’s new embassy in the capital. Cartes’s trip was scheduled for May 21 or May 22, a Paraguay government spokesman told the Reuters news agency. Nahshon hailed the “wonderful news as the international recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital gathers momentum.” Foreign embassies are currently located in Tel Aviv and its environs, as the international community has balked at recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, until the status of the city is set via a peace deal with the Palestinians.

Paraguay is set to become the third country, after the US and Guatemala, to transfer its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Israel said Monday.

Cartes’s trip was scheduled for May 21 or May 22, a Paraguay government spokesman told the Reuters news agency. Nahshon hailed the “wonderful news as the international recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital gathers momentum.” Foreign embassies are currently located in Tel Aviv and its environs, as the international community has balked at recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, until the status of the city is set via a peace deal with the Palestinians.

The Ambassador of Palestine to Uruguay Walid Abdel–Rahim told Sputnik, that recent decision of several Latin American countries to move their embassies from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is “illegal” and violates international law. “There is a UN resolution which calls on states not to open diplomatic missions in Jerusalem because, according to the international law, it is considered an occupied territory. Thus, having decided to move its embassy to Jerusalem, the country breaches the law. We cannot understand how a president or a country can take such a step,” – he stressed. This comes as a spokesman of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Emmanuel Nahshon, said in a statement that "Paraguay President Horacio Cartes plans to come to Israel by the end of the month to open an embassy in Jerusalem." However, this information contradicts an announcement made by Paraguay's foreign ministry, which stated that such a decision had not yet been made.

News article:
Following the relocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem this coming Monday, Guatemala is planning to make a similar move on Wednesday and open its own new embassy in Jerusalem’s Malha Technological Park. “Historically, we believe this is the right step and the right thing to do,” Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales told Israel Hayom in an exclusive interview. The embassy move comes on a particularly hectic week: In a downpour of diplomatic and security events, Israel will hold Jerusalem Day celebrations on Sunday, the Palestinians will commemorate “Nakba Day” on Monday (Nakba meaning “catastrophe” in Arabic, refers to the calamity that befell the Palestinians with the establishment of Israel), and Muslims will mark the start of Ramadan on Wednesday. Guatemala, a small and relatively little-known Central American country, indicated it would follow America’s lead just two days after U.S. President Donald Trump’s historic announcement recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel last December. Ahead of a historic state visit to Israel, Morales revealed what prompted his decision: “When I heard that President Trump decided to sign and approve the transfer of the embassy, I said to myself that that’s a brave step.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories “Of course, then the usual problems began … There was opposition in the United Nations and many people did not like it, but we said that we believe this is how it should be. So we also declared our intention to bring our embassy back to Jerusalem. It is important to note this word choice, ‘bring back,’ as our first embassy, which opened after the founding of the State of Israel, was in Jerusalem.” Q: Correct. About 40 years ago, Guatemala’s former President Eugenio Garcia transferred the Guatemalan Embassy to Tel Aviv. In hindsight, do you believe that this move was a mistake? A: These are presidential decisions, and many people would judge each and every one. This was the presidential decision then, and now we are coming to another presidential decision. Q: When I interviewed President Donald Trump in the White House after his first year in office, I asked him what he felt was the highlight of his presidency, and he answered without hesitating: “Having Jerusalem be your great capital.” What would you describe as the highlight of your term? A: One of the biggest highlights, without a doubt, is bringing back our embassy to Jerusalem. Besides that, we have historical matters, such as the territorial conflict we have with Belize, which is a problem we have had for over 200 years. Recently we conducted a referendum to decide whether to submit this matter to an international court. I believe that these are the biggest decisions I made as president. Q: Following up on this historic decision, did you speak about this subject with other Latin American countries? A: Yes, there are many conversations being held on the subject and much curiosity on the part of other leaders. I understood that a lot of leaders are considering similar moves, and I assume that some of them will declare similar moves soon, but I must keep the conversations confidential. Q: You returned recently from Costa Rica. Is Costa Rica next to relocate its embassy? We’ll keep it between us … A: I don’t know. This is relatively new, I don’t know how he [Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado] will move forward on this matter. I do know that our people are pleased with our decision to go from talk to action. That is what history judges. Q: Everything has a price. Israelis are pleased, but the Palestinians less so, as are some other countries. Since arriving at this decision, have there been repercussions? A: Decisions always come with a price. We support our allies and we support the countries that we view as our friends—as our brothers in many ways. It is customary to say, “Always love your friends,” so when Israel needs us more than ever, like now, we show up. The Republic of Guatemala—five times the size of Israel with a population that numbers some 16 million people—is considered a small country on a global scale. But it had a big hand in the historical U.N. vote to establish the State of Israel 70 years ago. Guatemala’s ambassador to the U.N. at the time worked to enlist the support of Latin American states for the partition plan. Out of 17 states within the bloc, 11 voted in favor and none opposed. Q: Israel and Guatemala are very far from one another geographically, but are close in their political positions. How do you explain this? A: Our countries are very close at heart, and we have between us a connection of thought, like with other countries. The U.S., Israel and Guatemala, we all love freedom. I believe that Guatemala has strong roots in accepting the Jewish people. It has a lot to do with faith. Here, more than 93 percent of the citizens are Christian—49 percent are Catholic and 45 percent are evangelical. Our passion for religion comes with great appreciation and admiration for peoples like the people of Israel. If we talk about historical matters or right decisions we must remember that in 1947, Guatemala voted in favor of the State of Israel in its struggle over its founding and since then we have maintained very warm relations—political, diplomatic, cultural and economic. Today, even though many political commentators criticize our decision on the embassy as wrong, the vast majority of our people are pleased that this is happening. This will provide the two countries with motivation to strengthen the ties between them. Q: After your current move, can Israel expect Guatemala to vote in international organizations, such as the U.N., alongside the U.S. and Israel? A: We gave support unequivocally in this matter, and we will continue doing so on every vote on the matter. Clearly we will consider every vote in and of itself, because we are responsible. As president of Guatemala, my biggest responsibility is to Guatemala and the principle that guides me is to do what is right for us. The decision to bring our embassy back to Jerusalem is the right step, and it also will strengthen our international standing and our relationship and ties with Israeli. Q: Ahead of your visit to the region there is a threat of bombs and rockets. The situation with Syria and Iran is not at all quiet, to put it mildly. A: I know that the situation is not simple at the moment, but I hope that everything will be all right soon. James Ernesto Morales Cabrera, 49 years old, legally changed his name to Jimmy Morales in 2011, at the peak of his career as a successful comedian in a popular Guatemalan television series. That year, he also crossed the lines and entered politics with a run for municipal elections and, only four years later, in October 2015, was elected in a landslide victory of 73 percent to become the 37th president of Guatemala. Q: When you won the 2015 election, you were not the leading candidate and this was a surprise to many people. You come from the outside, from the world of television and comedy. Meanwhile, leaders like Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron and 31-year-old Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz have been elected. In your opinion, what is going on in the world now that people have gotten fed up by politicians and now want a new kind of leader? How would you explain this phenomenon? A: Apparently, the modern world needs new figures who can do things differently than the politicians who came before them. The proof is that presidential decisions are different than what previous presidents have decided. I think that the wishes of the different peoples were translated into different decisions and actions than what we are used to, and they will be judged by history.

News article:
Following the relocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem this coming Monday, Guatemala is planning to make a similar move on Wednesday and open its own new embassy in Jerusalem’s Malha Technological Park. “Historically, we believe this is the right step and the right thing to do,” Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales told Israel Hayom in an exclusive interview. The embassy move comes on a particularly hectic week: In a downpour of diplomatic and security events, Israel will hold Jerusalem Day celebrations on Sunday, the Palestinians will commemorate “Nakba Day” on Monday (Nakba meaning “catastrophe” in Arabic, refers to the calamity that befell the Palestinians with the establishment of Israel), and Muslims will mark the start of Ramadan on Wednesday. Guatemala, a small and relatively little-known Central American country, indicated it would follow America’s lead just two days after U.S. President Donald Trump’s historic announcement recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel last December. Ahead of a historic state visit to Israel, Morales revealed what prompted his decision: “When I heard that President Trump decided to sign and approve the transfer of the embassy, I said to myself that that’s a brave step.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories “Of course, then the usual problems began … There was opposition in the United Nations and many people did not like it, but we said that we believe this is how it should be. So we also declared our intention to bring our embassy back to Jerusalem. It is important to note this word choice, ‘bring back,’ as our first embassy, which opened after the founding of the State of Israel, was in Jerusalem.” Q: Correct. About 40 years ago, Guatemala’s former President Eugenio Garcia transferred the Guatemalan Embassy to Tel Aviv. In hindsight, do you believe that this move was a mistake? A: These are presidential decisions, and many people would judge each and every one. This was the presidential decision then, and now we are coming to another presidential decision. Q: When I interviewed President Donald Trump in the White House after his first year in office, I asked him what he felt was the highlight of his presidency, and he answered without hesitating: “Having Jerusalem be your great capital.” What would you describe as the highlight of your term? A: One of the biggest highlights, without a doubt, is bringing back our embassy to Jerusalem. Besides that, we have historical matters, such as the territorial conflict we have with Belize, which is a problem we have had for over 200 years. Recently we conducted a referendum to decide whether to submit this matter to an international court. I believe that these are the biggest decisions I made as president. Q: Following up on this historic decision, did you speak about this subject with other Latin American countries? A: Yes, there are many conversations being held on the subject and much curiosity on the part of other leaders. I understood that a lot of leaders are considering similar moves, and I assume that some of them will declare similar moves soon, but I must keep the conversations confidential. Q: You returned recently from Costa Rica. Is Costa Rica next to relocate its embassy? We’ll keep it between us … A: I don’t know. This is relatively new, I don’t know how he [Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado] will move forward on this matter. I do know that our people are pleased with our decision to go from talk to action. That is what history judges. Q: Everything has a price. Israelis are pleased, but the Palestinians less so, as are some other countries. Since arriving at this decision, have there been repercussions? A: Decisions always come with a price. We support our allies and we support the countries that we view as our friends—as our brothers in many ways. It is customary to say, “Always love your friends,” so when Israel needs us more than ever, like now, we show up. The Republic of Guatemala—five times the size of Israel with a population that numbers some 16 million people—is considered a small country on a global scale. But it had a big hand in the historical U.N. vote to establish the State of Israel 70 years ago. Guatemala’s ambassador to the U.N. at the time worked to enlist the support of Latin American states for the partition plan. Out of 17 states within the bloc, 11 voted in favor and none opposed.

Paraguay’s Foreign Ministry is confirming that the country will shift its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, following the US and Guatemala. It says President Horacio Cartes ordered the move, but didn’t specify a date. Israel’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said earlier this week that Cartes will attend the opening ceremony, which he said would occur by the end of May. Paraguay didn’t confirm Cartes’ trip. The US officially opens its embassy in Jerusalem on May 14 followed two days later by Guatemala.

Morales' visit comes amid violent protests in the Gaza Strip triggered by the opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem on Monday, when Israel celebrated its 70th anniversary. Over 60 protestors, including several children, were killed and more than 2,700 others were injured in clashes with Israeli forces. The latter has blamed the Hamas Palestinian militant group for the erupted violence by organizing provocations. The militants, in their turn, have sent indirect messages to Israel hinting that it can tone down the massive Gaza protests which are expected to be further galvanized on Tuesday. According to the latest IDF report, at least 24 people, whose involvement in terrorism-related activities has been documented, were killed on Monday by Israeli servicemen. "IDF and ISA [Israel Securities Authority] inquiries reveal that at least 24 terrorists with documented terror backgrounds were killed during the violent riots along the Gaza border on Monday. Most were active Hamas terror organization operatives, and some were active operatives of Palestinian Islamic Jihad," the IDF said on its Twitter account. Yesterday afternoon, the IDF received intelligence that Hamas operatives were preparing to cross through the security fence from northern Gaza. IDF special forces arrived at the scene, & 8 armed terrorists hurled pipe bombs & grenades at the soldiers & the security fence. pic.twitter.com/8G73DjEvZl — IDF (@IDFSpokesperson) May 15, 2018 ​READ MORE: WATCH Palestinian Protesters Rally in Gaza, Bethlehem During Nakba Day Israel considers Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern districts of the city, which the Israelis seized from Jordan during the Six-Day War in 1967.

News article:
Jerusalem – Guatemala festively opened its new embassy in Jerusalem on Wednesday, becoming the second country to do so after the United States, and giving Israel a diplomatic boost as it faces international criticism for the deadly violence on the Gaza border. Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales dedicated the embassy just two days after a high-powered American delegation also marked the transfer of its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was fitting since Guatemala also followed the U.S. to be the second country to recognize Israel 70 years ago. “You were always among the first,” he said at the ceremony. “We remember our friends and Guatemala is our friend, then and now.” President Donald Trump announced his decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the American embassy there, triggering a joyous reaction from Netanyahu’s government. Israel has always claimed Jerusalem as its capital yet most countries opted to place their embassies in coastal Tel Aviv because of the holy city’s contested status. Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and view the relocation of the embassy as a one-sided move that invalidates the U.S. as a Mideast peace broker. The embassy move added fuel to the weekly Palestinian protests in Gaza demanding the right of return to Israel and the lifting of a decade-old naval blockade. They culminated Monday when Israel killed nearly 60 Palestinians in clashes along the border. The Gaza protesters set tires ablaze, sending up thick plumes of black smoke, and hurled firebombs and stones toward Israeli troops across the border. The Israeli military, which has come under international criticism for firing on unarmed protesters, said Hamas militants tried to carry out bombing and shooting attacks under the cover of the protests and released video of protesters ripping away parts of the barbed-wire border fence. The military said 14 of those killed Monday were actively involved in carrying out attacks. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel did everything it could to prevent civilian casualties but that Gaza’s Hamas rulers were to blame for using them as human shields. “The Hamas leadership is a group of cannibals who treat their children as armament,” he said during a visit to a military base in southern Israel. “They have rocket armament, personal armament and another kind of armament — their children and women.” Since the Hamas-led protests began on March 30, more than 110 Palestinians have been killed and more than 2,500 wounded by live fire, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Palestinian officials say the vast majority of the casualties have been unarmed protesters. The heavy death toll Monday, along with hundreds of wounded, made it by far the bloodiest day of cross-border violence since a devastating 2014 war between Israel and Hamas. It also triggered a diplomatic backlash against Israel. The U.N. Security Council held a special session that began with a moment of silence for the Palestinians who were killed. In Geneva, the U.N. human rights office said Israel has repeatedly violated international norms by using deadly live fire to repel protesters. Turkey expelled Israel’s ambassador and consul general and several European countries summoned the Israeli ambassadors to their foreign ministries for questioning and called for an international investigation. The diplomatic spat with Turkey intensifed after what Israel called the humiliating treatment of its ambassador, who was subjected to a severe security screening upon his departure from the airport in Istanbul. The event was intentionally captured by Turkish media. In response, Israel has summoned a top Turkish diplomat to be reprimanded. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long been a fierce critic of Israel and dramatically ratcheted up his rhetoric this week over Gaza and the U.S. embassy move. Netanyahu retorted that a “man whose hands are drenched in the blood of countless Kurdish civilians in Turkey and Syria is the last one who can preach to us about military ethics.” At the same time, Israel has found other nations following the U.S. lead and rallying to its defense. Besides Guatemala, Paraguay says it will also relocate its embassy to Jerusalem and Romania, the Czech Republic and Honduras have said they are considering doing the same. At Wednesday’s ceremony, Morales said his country was bringing a message of “love, peace and fraternity” to Israel. The Guatemalan Congress recently passed a law marking May 14 as “Israel-Guatemala Friendship Day.” Marking the move, the Jerusalem municipality illuminated the walls of the Old City walls late Tuesday with flags of Guatemala, Israel and the United States and a message thanking Morales.

Guatemala was set to open its embassy in Jerusalem on Wednesday morning, two days after the US moved its mission to the capital. The 10 a.m. dedication of the Jerusalem embassy will be attended by the Central American country’s president, Jimmy Morales, and foreign minister, Sandra Jovel, as well as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu will hold an official meeting with Morales and Jovel at his office later on Wednesday afternoon and will host the Guatemalan president and his wife for dinner, according to the prime minister’s schedule. In 1959, Guatemala was the first country to open its embassy in Jerusalem, but later moved it to Tel Aviv, following international rejection of Israeli claims to East Jerusalem. Tomorrow, #Guatemala will return its embassy to our eternal capital, #Jerusalem! President @jimmymoralesgt – our city is grateful for your leadership!

Advertisement The US embassy was officially opened in Jerusalem on Monday in an event attended by a large high-level American delegation, including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, and Israeli leaders. Guatemala was the first nation after the US to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, on December 24, 2017. Earlier this month, Guatemalan diplomatic staff began transferring furniture and other equipment into their unfinished office in the capital’s Malha Technology Park. Carlos Meyer, one of two Guatemalan diplomats stationed in Israel, has already moved to a new apartment in the capital’s Nahlaot neighborhood. The ambassador, Sara Solís Castañeda, is expected to commute to Jerusalem from her Herzliya residence until she finds a new home in the capital.

Guatemala was set to open its embassy in Jerusalem on Wednesday morning, two days after the US moved its mission to the capital. The 10 a.m. dedication of the Jerusalem embassy will be attended by the Central American country’s president, Jimmy Morales, and foreign minister, Sandra Jovel, as well as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu will hold an official meeting with Morales and Jovel at his office later on Wednesday afternoon and will host the Guatemalan president and his wife for dinner, according to the prime minister’s schedule.

Carlos Meyer, one of two Guatemalan diplomats stationed in Israel, has already moved to a new apartment in the capital’s Nahlaot neighborhood. The ambassador, Sara Solís Castañeda, is expected to commute to Jerusalem from her Herzliya residence until she finds a new home in the capital.

Meeting with Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanks him for being the second to open an embassy in Jerusalem. “Guatemala was with us at the start, and Guatemala is with us today,” Netanyahu says, referring to the country being the first to open an embassy in Jerusalem in 1959, before moving it to Tel Aviv in 1980. Morales calls the opening the start of “a new era” in ties between the countries and expresses hopes for stronger bilateral relations.

News article:
JERUSALEM (JTA) — Guatemala inaugurated its embassy in Jerusalem, the second country to move its main diplomatic mission from Tel Aviv. Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales attended the opening Wednesday morning of the embassy in the Technological Park of southern Jerusalem’s Malha neighborhood. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed Morales and his delegation in Spanish with “Buenas Dias,” which means good day in Spanish, before switching to English. “This is the beginning of something extraordinary, or I would say, the re-beginning of something extraordinary, which is the relationship between Guatemala and Israel,” he said. Netanyahu noted that Guatemala was the second country behind the United States to recognize Israel’s independence after the partition vote in the United Nations. The United States opened its Jerusalem embassy in the southern Jerusalem’s Arnona neighborhood on Monday. Netanyahu told Morales that he would visit Guatemala on his next trip to Latin America. Guatemala previously had an embassy in Jerusalem, the first country in the world to open an embassy in the city in 1956. It closed in 1980 following a United Nations Security Council resolution that called for such closures. Before the ceremony, Netanyahu and Morales held a private meeting. They were scheduled to meet after the ceremony with their entourages. Paraguay is scheduled to open a Jerusalem embassy on May 21 with its president, Horacio Cartes, due to be in attendance.

News article:
Guatemala became the second country to open its embassy in Jerusalem on Wednesday, The Jerusalem Post reported. At the dedication ceremony, held at Jerusalem’s Malha Technological Park, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the opening of the embassy in Jerusalem goes “hand in hand” with the opening of the United States embassy in Israel’s capital two days before. In his remarks, Netanyahu highlighted the friendly relationship that both countries have shared since 1948 when Guatemala became the second country, after the U.S., to recognize the State of Israel. Netanyahu mentioned that in Israel, there is a Guatemala Street “about a kilometer from here in Jerusalem” and in many Israeli cities in honor of former Guatemalan Ambassador to the United Nations Jorge Garcia Granados, who was critical in convincing Latin American countries to favorably vote for General Assembly Resolution 181 which called for the partition of Mandatory Palestine into a Jewish state and Arab state. “We remember our friends, and Guatemala is our friend — then and now,” Netanyahu said. At the ceremony, Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales highlighted the friendly relationship that the U.S, Israel and Guatemala share: “70 years ago the US and Guatemala voted in favor of partition,” he said. “Three friends that share friendship and loyalty.” Was very pleased to meet today with President Morales of Guatemala. I thanked him for joining with the United States in moving Guatemala's embassy to Jerusalem, Israel. A courageous and just decision! pic.twitter.com/r20EKHKhFy — David M. Friedman (@USAmbIsrael) May 16, 2018 Around 150 people attended the ceremony including U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, businessman Sheldon Adelson, Jerusalem mayor Nir Barkat along with several Guatemalan politicians. Netanyahu said that he plans to visit Latin America by the end of this year and that he will stop in Guatemala. Outgoing Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes announced a week ago that his nation will also move its embassy to Jerusalem before the month of May is over.

News article:
Just two days after the United States opened its embassy in Jerusalem to much fanfare, Guatemala made its move to open its embassy in the Israeli capital. Guatemala’s President Jimmy Morales said: “With the opening of our embassy in the city of Jerusalem, Guatemala takes a courageous decision, a step forward in favor of union and friendship. This decision will be a legacy that will bring great benefits to everyone.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the opening “a great day” for both Israel and Guatemala. “I welcome my friend President Jimmy Morales,” he said. “Guatemala was with us at the beginning, and Guatemala is with us today, and we welcome the opening of the embassy in Jerusalem.” Despite being a small and largely impoverished Central American country, Guatemala has long represented an important partner for Israel. In 1947, it became one of the first countries to voice support for the creation of the Jewish state; in 1956, it became one of the first Latin American countries to open an embassy in Jerusalem, although it later relocated the mission in 1978 to the Tel Aviv suburb of Herzliya. Today, as Israel is attempting to build nontraditional allies around the world, Guatemala has expressed an interest in bolstering agriculture, science, technology and security ties with the Israelis. Following Guatemala and the United States, Paraguay plans to move its embassy by the end of the month, while leaders in Romania, Czech Republic and Honduras are also contemplating a move.

Israeli security forces stand guard outside the US consulate in Jerusalem. AFP Tel Aviv - Asharq Al-Awsat Paraguay's Foreign Minister Eladio Loizaga Caballero has said that his country will open the country's new embassy to Israel in Jerusalem on Tuesday, following similar steps by the United States and Guatemala. But the minister denied that the embassy opening was linked to the US and Guatemalan decision to inaugurate their missions in Jerusalem. He told the Israeli media on Thursday that the decision on the embassy move was taken for “technical reasons” eight months ago. The Paraguayan decision to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem does not stop the country from having “strong and close relations” with the Palestinians, the minister insisted. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely said that all embassies in Tel Aviv would move to Jerusalem within the coming years. She thanked the US administration for “exerting strong efforts to convince our friends in several countries to move their embassies to Jerusalem because it knows its importance for Israel.” In December, US President Donald Trump sparked global controversy by announcing that the United States would move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

Paraguay opened its Israel embassy in Jerusalem on Monday, the second country to follow the United States in making the politically sensitive move from Tel Aviv. Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended the inauguration ceremony. The United States relocated its embassy to Jerusalem a week ago, drawing Palestinian anger, and was followed by Guatemala on Wednesday. Israel's Foreign Ministry called the moves a sign of the "extraordinary times". The move has received a mixed response at home in Paraguay where Mr Cartes is set to be replaced by president-elect Mario Abdo Benitez in less than two months. Mr Benitez said he had not been consulted about the move. Dr. Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Executive Committee, called on Paraguay to reverse course and change its decision. "Paraguay has conspired with Israel, the United States and Guatemala to entrench the military occupation and to seal the fate of occupied Jerusalem," Ms Ashrawi said. “We call on Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes to retract his decision and take the necessary steps to hold Israel accountable for its flagrant violations of human rights and crimes against humanity”. __________ Read more: 'Why did you leave me?'

The international consensus, which US President Donald Trump broke with by moving the embassy, is that the status of the city should be negotiated through bilateral negotiations.

At the US embassy inauguration last week, Mr Trump said the move had been a long time coming. But just miles away in Gaza, tens of thousands of Palestinian protesters rallied against the move and conditions in the enclave.

On Monday, Paraguay became the third country to open its embassy in Jerusalem, The Jerusalem Post reported. Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes, along with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, opened the embassy in the Malha Technological Park, the same building where Guatemala inaugurated its embassy in Jerusalem last week. During the ceremony, Netanyahu noted that Paraguay is a “true friend” of Israel. He recalled that Paraguay helped Jews escape Nazi Germany before and during the Holocaust and supported Israel during the partition vote in the UN in 1947. “Paraguay, before but especially under your leadership, took a very bold stance in international affairs and refused to cooperate with the lies directed against Israel,” Netanyahu said. Meanwhile, in his speech, Cartes indicated that the embassy opening “expresses the sincere friendship and brave solidarity” between the two countries. He also said: “From the depth of my heart, I appreciate this country that courageously defends its right to live in peace and it is building a praiseworthy economically prosperous state that ensures its future and that of its children.” During his ceremony speech, Netanyahu indicated that cooperation with Paraguay would be “greater in several areas including agriculture, security and technology.” In 2016, Cartes became the first Paraguayan president to visit Israel. The President and Prime Minister met for a second time in 2017 in Buenos Aires on Netanyahu’s first trip to Latin America. Paraguay’s embassy opening comes exactly one week after the United States opened its embassy in an existing consular building in the neighborhood of Arnona in Jerusalem, an area which has been in the hands of Israel since 1948. Two days later, Guatemala opened its embassy in Jerusalem as well. Other countries have expressed desire to move their embassies to Jerusalem including the Czech Republic and Romania. In upcoming weeks, it is expected that Honduras will announce its embassy move to Jerusalem. [Photo: YouTube/ euronews]

Source: Xinhua| 2018-05-21 22:08:42|Editor: Xiang Bo Video Player Close JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Paraguay opened its embassy to Israel in Jerusalem Monday, becoming the third country to do so following the United States and Guatemala. Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes, who arrived in Israel Sunday evening, opened the embassy along with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Malha Technological Park, the same building in which Guatemala opened its embassy in Jerusalem last week. On May 14, the United Stated opened its embassy in what Israel claims to be the capital of the Jewish country --Jerusalem. Wide-spread protests broke out in West Bank cities and Gaza. According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, more than 60 were killed and over 3,000 wounded due to clashes with the Israeli Defense Forces. Israel seized East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War, along with the rest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. It later annexed East Jerusalem and declared it as part of its "eternal and indivisible capital," in a move that has never been recognized by the international community. Palestinians, who make up more than one third of the city's overall population, consider East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. The peace talks between Palestine and Israel have been stalled since April 2014. The U.S.-sponsored talks that lasted for nine months achieved no tangible results.

JNS.org – The White House issued a statement on Tuesday night praising Paraguay for relocating its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were in attendance at the May 21 inauguration, just five days after the Guatemalan embassy opening in Jerusalem, and a week after America became the first country to move its embassy to Jerusalem in an internationally televised event. “We thank our Western Hemisphere partner for joining us in recognizing Israel’s capital and encouraging additional moves,” the statement said. “By being the first head of state to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to open an embassy there on May 14, 2018, President [Donald] Trump reprised the role President [Harry] Truman played 70 years ago when he was the first to recognize the State of Israel.” The statement concluded that the United States hopes to welcome “many more of our friends and allies in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel.” The Palestinian Authority, on the other hand, blasted Paraguay for the move, which they called “illegal, illegitimate, an act of aggression against the Palestinian people and their rights, a violation of relevant United Nations resolutions and international law, and submission to American and Israeli dictates and bribes.”

News article:
By World Israel News Guatemala made history on Wednesday when it moved its embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, two days after the US made the same move. Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin and several heads of state from both countries were present at the momentous ceremony. "It is not a coincidence that Guatemala is opening its embassy in Jerusalem two days after the US. You are always among the first," Netanyahu said. Guatemala supported the creation of the State of Israel in 1948 and was the second country to recognize it, after the US. "We remember our friends and Guatemala is our friend, then and now." "We share so many goals and values even though were are so far away," Netanyahu stated, saying he would advance the bilateral relationship in "practical ways." In his address, Morales described the relationship between the two countries as the "love between brothers." The embassy is located in Jerusalem's Malha Technological Park. Guatemalan Embassy, welcome home! Guatemala was the first country in the world to open an embassy in Jerusalem in 1956, but moved it to Tel Aviv in 1980, so in essence, it is returning to the capital. "Guatemalan Embassy, welcome home! Ahead of the inauguration of the embassy, we have illuminated the walls of the Old City with the flags of Guatemala and Israel," Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat stated on Tuesday. Barkat thanked Morales for his "courageous decision" and called upon other countries to join the US and Guatemala in doing the "right thing." Shortly after taking office in 2015, Morales, a devout evangelical Christian, visited a synagogue in Guatemala City, where he announced his intention to visit Israel. He made the historic trip in November 2016. Guatemala was one of the nine nations to vote against a United Nations resolution that condemned the US for Trump's historic recognition of Jerusalem. Guatemala will be joined by Paraguay and Honduras in committing to the move. The Czech Republic has also expressed interest; however, its government has not issued a unified statement. Liviu Dragnea of the Social Democratic Party, which effectively runs Romania's government, said Bucharest was ready to move the embassy. In April 2017, the Russian Foreign Ministry made a similar move to recognize "west Jerusalem" as the Israeli capital.

People look at the damage caused by the bomb in front of a church in Alexandria, Egypt in April 2017. (Reuters) Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt’s military criminal court referred on Tuesday the cases of 36 members of the ISIS terrorist group to the Grand Mufti after they were sentenced to death for attacks against churches in the country. The defendants are suspected of involvement in bombings that hit three Coptic churches - one at Cairo’s Coptic Cathedral in December 2016 that killed at least 25, and two that hit churches in Alexandria and Tanta on the same day in April 2017 and killed more than 45 people. Egypt requires that courts refer cases to the Grand Mufti for consideration of the death penalty ahead of a final verdict although his decision is non-binding. The court will issue a final verdict on May 15. Eleven of the 36 are being tried in absentia, a lawyer involved in the case told Reuters. Public prosecutor Nabil Sadek said previously that some of the suspects held leadership positions in ISIS and formed cells in Cairo and the southern province of Qena to carry out the church attacks. Some of the defendants are also accused of carrying out an attack on a checkpoint in Egypt’s Western Desert that killed at least eight policemen in 2017.

Egypt's former anti-corruption chief Hisham Geneina speaks with AFP in Cairo on June 23, 2016 Egyptian former anti-corruption chief Hisham Geneina will face military trial after saying a presidential candidate he supported had documents damning to state officials, his lawyer said on Thursday. The military had detained Geneina in February following his remarks in an interview with Huffpost Arabi, the Arabic version of the US news site. He will stand trial on April 16 on charges of "spreading news that harms the armed forces," his lawyer Ali Taha said. Geneina had been a top campaign aide to Sami Anan, whom the military also detained after he announced he would stand in last month's presidential election against incumbent Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who won overwhelmingly. Geneina had said the documents Anan allegedly possessed "revolve around political events and crises Egyptian society has passed through" since the January 2011 uprising which toppled veteran strongman Hosni Mubarak. He said they were held at a "secure" place abroad and could be released if Anan is harmed. Moataz Wadnan, the journalist who conducted the interview, has also been arrested.

CAIRO, April 12 (Reuters) - Egypt's former anti-corruption chief has been referred to a military court for trial on charges of spreading false news harmful to the military establishment, his lawyer said Thursday. Hisham Genena ran alongside former military chief-of-staff Sami Anan as a member of his short-lived presidential campaign before the latter was detained in January and accused by the army of running for office without permission, bringing his bid to a halt. Genena was arrested and put under investigation by the military prosecutor in February over comments he had allegedly made in an interview with the HuffPost Arabi news website. In the interview, Genena said Anan possessed documents that were damning of senior Egyptian officials. He gave no details. Anan's lawyer criticised Genena and wrote on his Facebook page that statements Genena made were "completely untrue". He did not say which statements he referred to (nL8N1Q34M0). The former auditor was beaten up outside his home shortly after Anan's arrest and has accused the government of being behind his assault. His alleged assailants said his injuries were the result of a fight after a car accident (nL4N1PV4R4). Genena's lawyer, Ali Taha, gave no further details about the charges he faced. He is due in court on April 16. Family members say he is depressed and in poor physical condition. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was re-elected in April with 97 percent of the vote.

Former Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide Mohamed Badie - Photo by: Kareem abdelAziz/Egypt Today CAIRO – 13 April 2018: Egypt’s Court of Cassation will hand down on Saturday its unchallenged ruling on the retrial of former Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide Mohamed Badie over charges of inciting violence in the “Rabaa operation room case”. Badie, along with 17 other defendants, have appealed against court verdicts ranging from life imprisonment to five years in jail. The defendants were charged of orchestrating a plan to spread chaos and violence across Egypt following the dispersal of the 2013 Rabaa and Nahda sit-ins. On May 8, 2017, the Giza Criminal Court sentenced Badie and two other defendants to life imprisonment (25 years). Meanwhile, 15 other defendants were sentenced to five years in prison each, and 21 others were acquitted. The 18 convicts have challenged the Giza Court’s ruling before the Court of Cassation. The defendants were charged with setting up an operations room to direct the movement and actions of the Brotherhood’s members in the streets after the August 2013 dispersal, and ordering the arson of churches and public properties. Badie, 74, was the eighth leader of the banned Muslim Brotherhood (MB) organization. He became leader of the organization in 2010 after the death of his predecessor, Madi Akef. He was arrested on August 19, 2013 as part of a nation-wide crackdown on Brotherhood leaders in the wake of increasing violence and protests after two Brotherhood sit-ins were forcefully dispersed on August 14, 2013. Badie was found guilty in the trial of “cutting-off Qalyoub Road”, in which 36 others were also convicted in October 2016. He is still being tried in 11 known cases, mainly over charges of “inciting violence.” However, he stated in a hearing over charges of inciting violence in Minya that he is facing 48 trials, Masrawy reported on February 28. Arab Police Station Case On May, 9 2017, the Court of Cassation revoked verdicts ranging from 10 years in prison to life against Badie and 49 co-defendants over charges of inciting violence in August 2013. The court accepted only 50 defendants’ appeals against charges of inciting violence outside the Al-Arab police station in the coastal city of Port Said; the court ordered a retrial. In August 2015, the Port Said Criminal Court handed down sentences of 25 years in prison against 95 Brotherhood leaders (19 in absentia and 76 fugitives), and 10 years in prison against 28 others; in the same trial, a total of 68 other defendants were acquitted of the charges. Espionage for Hamas Badie and former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, with 20 co-defendants, are being retried over charges of “spying” for Palestine’s Gaza-based Hamas movement. According to the prosecution, the defendants are charged with “leaking classified information” to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, Hamas and Hezbollah about national security and the Armed Forces. In the first trial, Badie was sentenced to life imprisonment, while Brotherhood leader Khairat al-Shater and two others were sentenced to death. Rabaa Dispersal Case The Criminal Court of Cairo is considering another case that is publicly known as the “Rabaa sit-in dispersal case”, in which Badie is being charged with “staging an armed gathering in Rabaa Square, illegally possessing and handling weapons, blocking driveways, and deliberately vandalizing public property, along with other counts relating to murdering policemen and citizens.” Prison Break He and 27 co-defendants are being tried in the case of breaking into Egyptian prisons, known as the break-in of the eastern border in 2011. The retrial of the defendants came after the Court of Cassation overturned in November the sentences issued by the Criminal Court to execute Morsi, Badie, his deputy Rashad al-Bayoumi, Morsi's adviser Mohye Hamed, former Parliament Speaker Mohamed el-Katatny and leading MB figure Essam el-Erian, and to punish 20 other defendants with life imprisonment. Guidance Bureau Incidents Badie and 12 other defendants are being retried by the Cairo Criminal Court over charges of inciting murder against peaceful demonstrators outside the MB Guidance Bureau in Moqattam, Cairo in 2013. In February 2015, Badie and Shater were sentenced to life imprisonment, while four others were handed down death verdicts. In January 2016, the Court of Cassation overturned the verdicts and ordered the retrial. Al-Bahr Al-Azam Case On May 27, the Cairo Criminal Court will issue its ruling in the “al-Bahr al-Azam case”, in which Badie and 13 other Brotherhood members are being retried. In September 2014, the defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment over charges of “inciting clashes” in al-Bahr al-Azam district, Giza, causing death of five people. However, the Court of Cassation overturned the verdicts on November 8, 2015. Istiqama Mosque Following the ouster of former President Morsi on July 3, 2013, pro-Muslim Brotherhood protests calling for his reinstatement clashed with security forces and residents outside Istiqama Mosque in Giza. Badie and 13 co-defendants were charged with killing 10 and attempting to murder 20 others in the clashes. On August 30, 2014, Badie and seven others were sentenced to life imprisonment, while six others were sentenced to death. The rulings were also overturned and a retrial was ordered. El Idwa Incidents Following the Rabaa sit-in dispersal on August 14, 2013, the city of El Idwa in Minya governorate witnessed acts of violence and vandalism, during which a police station was attacked and a police officer was killed. Badie is being charged over inciting violence in the clashes. The prosecution showed a violence-inciting statement signed by him. However, Badie has denied the charges. The case also includes 682 co-defendants. They are also charged with storming a number of state-owned institutions, such as the agriculture unit, veterinary center and the real estate office in the city. In April 2014, the Minya Criminal Court sentenced all defendants to death. However, a retrial was ordered after overturning the ruling by the Court of Cassation. Ismailia Incidents A total of 105 defendants, including Badie, are being tried in the “Ismailia incidents case”. They face charges of inciting violence, and killing and injuring people in clashes between pro-Muslim Brotherhood supporters and security forces outside the Brotherhood office in Ismailia in July 2014. Badie and 35 co-defendants were handed down life imprisonment sentences in May 2016. However, a retrial was ordered. Suez Incidents Badie and Brotherhood members Mohamed El-Beltagy and Safwat Hegazy were sentenced to 10 years in prison by a military court in December 2015 over charges of inciting riots. Following the Rabaa dispersal, clashes erupted between the protesters and security forces, killing five people. In 2015, the court also sentenced a total of 90 co-defendants to life imprisonment in absentia and acquitted 50 others. The appeal submitted by Badie against the ruling was accepted and a retrial was ordered. Beni Suef Incidents The Beni Suef Criminal Court is considering a retrial against Badie and 92 other defendants over charges of “setting fire” to state institutions, including a police station, a school and a prosecution building, following the dispersal of the Rabaa sit-in.

FILE- Former Head of Egypt's Central Auditing Organization Hesham Genena - AFP CAIRO – 19 April 2018: A military court will pronounce the verdict on Hisham Geneina, former head of the Central Auditing Organization, on April 24, over his controversial statements to HuffPost Arabi. Geneina was arrested on February 13 following his statement about Sami Anan, the now arrested former presidential candidate, where Geneina said that Anan possesses documents against the country's current leadership, which he kept outside Egypt. According to Geneina, Anan’s documents incriminate the country’s leadership in the major events that happened following the 2011 January revolution and may be leaked in case Anan is harmed. During Wednesday’s trial, Geneina’s lawyers, including Farid al Deeb, expressed objection to their client’s trial by a military court, claiming that Geneina’s case does not fall under the jurisdiction of the military court. Deeb was the lawyer of former President Hosni Mubarak, and his Interior Minister Habib al Adli who were freed following their acquittal of charges that included corruption and killing protestors. Following Geneina’s statements, military spokesperson Tamer el-Refai said that the Egyptian army will investigate the statements, saying that they drive a wedge between the Egyptian army and the citizens amid a war against terrorism. Refai added that the army will act according to the right granted to it by the constitution to preserve Egypt’s national security, dignity and honor. Anan Junior accused Geneina of slander and spreading false information on the behalf of his father. Nasser Amin, lawyer of Anan’s family, condemned Geneina’s statement, saying that all of the statements published contravene the truth and that he would take legal measures against Geneina. Former Egyptian Chief of Staff Sami Anan was arrested in January on charges of announcing his presidential bid without obtaining permits from the Armed Forces and committing forgery to be included in the presidential race.

Former attorney general Hesham Barakat - Archive photo CAIRO – 19 April 2018: Cairo’s Court of Cassation upheld on Thursday a primary ruling to list 46 defendants as terrorists, over the killing of former Attorney General Hisham Barakat. During its session on Thursday, Egypt’s top court of appeals rejected a challenge filed by the 46 defendants to cancel their terror designation. In July 2017, Cairo Criminal Court sentenced 28 defendants to death, accused of being involved in the assassination of Barakat. The court also sentenced 15 defendants in the same case to life imprisonment, eight defendants to 15 years in prison and 15 defendants to 10 years in prison. The defendants are facing other charges that include being associated with Palestinian militant group Hamas, aiming to foment instability in the country and illegally possessing firearms. Barakat was assassinated on June 29, 2015, when a car bomb detonated in his car outside his home in Cairo’s Heliopolis neighborhood.

ALGIERS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- An Algerian court has sentenced a Liberian national to death for "spying for Israel," the Algeria Press Service reported Tuesday. The case was heard by the Ghardaia Court, 600 km south of the capital Algiers, where six other individuals of different sub-Saharan nationalities were sentenced to 10 years in prison with fines of up to 20 million Algerian dinars (26,000 U.S. dollars). The defendants were charged with spying, conspiracy to seriously undermine Algeria's security, and glorifying terrorism. They pleaded not guilty, claiming that they entered Algeria in order to reach Europe, the report said. The seven people were arrested in January 2016 by security services in downtown Ghardaia amid a violent sectarian strife in the region.

An Egyptian criminal court has placed 169 members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood group on the country's terror list. The defendants are facing charges of conspiring to infiltrate state institutions with the aim of overthrowing the regime by force and spreading chaos in the country. The court’s decision is based on state security investigations, which revealed that the defendants attempted to revive the group's activities by recruiting new members to its armed wings, spread rumors and provided financial and logistical assistance to the Brotherhood, which was designated a terrorist group in 2013. Under the country’s anti-terrorism law, any person placed on the terror list is subject to a travel ban and having their assets frozen. Egypt's terror list contains over 1,500 names, including top Brotherhood leaders. The list includes Egypt’s former Islamist president Mohamed Morsi, the group’s supreme guide Mohamed Badie, and the Brotherhood's deputy supreme guide Mahmoud Ezzat, who fled Egypt in 2013. The list also includes Ibrahim Mounir, the Brotherhood's secretary-general in London, who has been convicted of planning attacks in Egypt from abroad. Search Keywords: Short link:

Rights group says arrest of Amal Fathy is a "new low in Egypt's crackdown on freedom of expression" CAIRO, May 11 (Reuters) - Egyptian police on Friday detained an activist after she posted a video on social media criticising the government for failing to protect women against sexual harassment and over worsening living conditions, Amnesty International said. The rights group said the arrest of Amal Fathy, a member of the now banned April 6 youth movement which played a role in 2011 mass protests that forced President Hosni Mubarak out of office, was a "new low in Egypt's crackdown on freedom of expression". Egyptian police could not immediately be reached for comment, but a security source said Fathy had been detained over a complaint that she had insulted the Egyptian state through an offensive social media posting. Human rights groups have repeatedly criticised Egypt's human rights situation, saying conditions in the country have continued to deteriorate under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who came to power in 2013 after the army overthrew Islamist President Mohamed Morsi following protests against his rule. Amnesty International said that in the video posted on Facebook May 9, Fathy spoke about the prevalence of sexual harassment in Egypt, criticized the government's failure to protect women and for deteriorating human rights, socioeconomic conditions and public services. "It is a dark day when the Egyptian authorities are more concerned with silencing a woman who speaks out about sexual harassment than taking steps to address the issue," said Najia Bounaim, North Africa Campaigns Director at Amnesty International. Sisi's supporters say his tough security and economic measures are needed to keep the country stable as it recovers from political chaos and tackles grave economic challenges and the Islamist insurgency. Amnesty said Fathy was detained from her home at 2:30 A.M. on Friday, together with her husband, Mohamed Lotfy -- a human rights lawyer, and were taken to a police station in Maadi in southern Cairo. Lotfy was freed some three hours later but Fathy was kept in custody to allow a prosecutor to examine her case. A prosecutor later ordered her detained for 15 days for questioning on charges of incitement to overthrow the ruling system, publishing lies and misusing social media, according to a lawyer at the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, where her husband works. Egyptian media had earlier slammed Fathy, saying she had used foul language in the 12-minute recording in which she seemed to express her anger at poor public services at a local bank, over heavy traffic, sexual harassment by a local taxi driver and over a general deterioration in living conditions. An Egyptian security source said: "She is accused and wanted for arrest in relation to complaints accusing her of insulting the Egyptian state, by publishing a posting that contained swearing and defamation against Egypt."

Muslim Brotherhood members have been placed on terror lists in Egypt. (Getty Images) Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat A Cairo court in Egypt ordered on Saturday that 20 Muslim Brotherhood members be placed on terrorist lists for the next five years. The court based its decision on proof that the accused were terrorists because some of them were leaders of the Brotherhood. Others were accused of joining and funding the group to carry out terror attacks and promote its ideology. Egypt labels the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. Several charges have been laid against the 20 terror suspects, including purchasing weapons and arms. They also received some of their funds through Brotherhood leaderships abroad In a separate development, the Cairo Criminal Court set August 4 as the date for the retrial of seven defendants in the so-called Tanta terror cell case. The suspects are charged with forming a terror cell in the western city of Tanta for the purpose of attacking the army and police. In 2016, the suspects were originally given death or prison sentences. The northern Cairo criminal court then accepted the defendants’ appeal in 2017 and ordered a retrial.

News article:
Algiers - Asharq Al-Awsat Amnesty International has asked the Algerian authorities to release a blogger who faces the death penalty on “espionage charges.” In a post early last year, Merzoug Touati interviewed an Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson in which he disputes accusations by the Algerian authorities that the Israeli authorities were involved in protests in Algeria. The trial of Touati “on trumped-up espionage charges based on online posts is yet another stain on the country’s human rights record,” Amnesty International said on Wednesday on the eve of the opening hearing. Touati, 32, “faces charges relating to a Facebook post and YouTube video that authorities claim encouraged civil unrest. He has been in detention since January 2017,” it said. “Amnesty International has reviewed the court documents which list as 'evidence' the posts published by Touati before his Facebook account and website were deleted, and found that there was no incitement to violence or advocacy of hatred, rather his posts were covered by freedom of expression in relation to his work as a citizen-journalist,” according to the US-basked human rights organization. “Amnesty International therefore considers Merzoug Touati a prisoner of conscience held solely for expressing his peaceful opinions,” it said. Heba Morayef, Middle East and North Africa regional director at Amnesty International, said that every day “Touati spends in prison ... is a further stain on Algeria’s human rights record.” “It is ludicrous that a Facebook post expressing peaceful opinion could lead to the death penalty. Touati represents the broken dreams of a generation in a country where freedom of expression has been repeatedly undermined,” she added.

News article:
PARIS: Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan, detained in France over rape allegations by four women, has lost an appeal for early release ahead of his trial, the Paris appeals court said late on Tuesday. Judges had earlier this month refused bail for 55-year-old Ramadan, who is being treated behind bars for multiple sclerosis, as well as a request for release on health grounds. The Swiss citizen was not in court to hear Tuesday’s ruling as his defence argued that testimony from his accusers contained "contradictions". "There is no objective reason to keep Mr Tariq Ramadan in provisional custody," his lawyer Emmanuel Marsigny told AFP after failing to sway the court. He had proposed that Ramadan be held at home and surrender his passport. "The presumption of innocence is trampled underfoot," Marsigny added. The prominent TV pundit and Oxford University professor, whose grandfather founded Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood movement, has been held since February on charges that he raped two women in France. Two other women have since made rape claims against him. Prosecutors argued Ramadan should stay in detention over fears that he could potentially flee France and also to protect the women who made the allegations against him. While the investigation is under way, "it appears to the plaintiffs more desirable that Mr Ramadan be available to the court," said Francis Szpiner, a lawyer for two of Ramadan’s accusers. Many of Ramadan’s supporters -- including two million Facebook followers -- insist he has been unfairly targeted because he is Muslim, while Marsigny has slammed what he describes as "lies" and inconsistencies by Ramadan’s accusers. Ramadan’s first accuser, Henda Ayari, 41, is a feminist activist who previously practised a conservative strain of Islam. She says Ramadan raped her in a Paris hotel room in 2012. A second woman, who is disabled, claims that Ramadan raped and beat her in a hotel in the southeastern city of Lyon in 2009. The third accuser, a French Muslim woman who is using the pseudonym "Marie", came forward in early March and claims to have suffered multiple rapes in France, Brussels and London between 2013 and 2014. A fourth woman has filed rape charges in Geneva against Ramadan. Ramadan has denied wrongdoing and is suing one of his accusers, Ayari, for slander.

The Swiss citizen was not in court to hear Tuesday’s ruling as his defence argued that testimony from his accusers contained "contradictions". "There is no objective reason to keep Mr Tariq Ramadan in provisional custody," his lawyer Emmanuel Marsigny told AFP after failing to sway the court. He had proposed that Ramadan be held at home and surrender his passport. "The presumption of innocence is trampled underfoot," Marsigny added. The prominent TV pundit and Oxford University professor, whose grandfather founded Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood movement, has been held since February on charges that he raped two women in France. Two other women have since made rape claims against him. Prosecutors argued Ramadan should stay in detention over fears that he could potentially flee France and also to protect the women who made the allegations against him. While the investigation is under way, "it appears to the plaintiffs more desirable that Mr Ramadan be available to the court," said Francis Szpiner, a lawyer for two of Ramadan’s accusers. Many of Ramadan’s supporters -- including two million Facebook followers -- insist he has been unfairly targeted because he is Muslim, while Marsigny has slammed what he describes as "lies" and inconsistencies by Ramadan’s accusers. Ramadan’s first accuser, Henda Ayari, 41, is a feminist activist who previously practised a conservative strain of Islam. She says Ramadan raped her in a Paris hotel room in 2012. A second woman, who is disabled, claims that Ramadan raped and beat her in a hotel in the southeastern city of Lyon in 2009. The third accuser, a French Muslim woman who is using the pseudonym "Marie", came forward in early March and claims to have suffered multiple rapes in France, Brussels and London between 2013 and 2014. A fourth woman has filed rape charges in Geneva against Ramadan. Ramadan has denied wrongdoing and is suing one of his accusers, Ayari, for slander.

FILE - Mohammed Badie, Supreme Guide of Muslim Brotherhood group CAIRO – 27 May 2018: Cairo Criminal Court adjourned Monday the retrial of former Muslim Brotherhood group supreme guide, Mohamed Badie, and eight other MB members in the case known as “al-Bahr al-Azam” to July 29. In September 2014, the defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment over charges of “inciting clashes” in al-Bahr al-Azam district, Giza, causing the death of five people. However, the Court of Cassation overturned the verdicts on November 8, 2015. On April 14, Egypt Court of Cassation upheld a life imprisonment sentence (25 years) against Badie, over charges of inciting violence in the “Rabaa operation room case”. Badie along with other defendants were charged of orchestrating a plan to spread chaos and violence across Egypt following the dispersal of the 2013 Rabaa and Nahda sit-ins. On May 8, 2017, the Giza Criminal Court sentenced Badie and two other defendants to life imprisonment. Meanwhile, 15 other defendants were sentenced to five years in prison each, and 21 others were acquitted. Badie was found guilty in the trial of “cutting-off Qalyoub Road”, in which 36 defendants were also convicted in October 2016. He is still being tried in 11 known cases, mainly over charges of “inciting violence”. However, he stated in a hearing over charges of inciting violence in Minya that he is facing 48 trials, Masrawy reported on February 28. Badie was sentenced to life in prison in many other cases, including espionage for Hamas, as well as the guidance bureau and Istiqama mosque incidents; however, retrials were ordered in the cases. He was arrested on August 19, 2013, as part of a nation-wide crackdown on Brotherhood leaders in the wake of increasing violence and protests after two Brotherhood sit-ins were dispersed in 2013. The incidents caused the deaths of hundreds of policemen and supporters of the MB-affiliated former president Mohamed Morsi. Badie, 74, was the eighth leader of the banned Muslim Brotherhood (MB) organization. He became leader of the organization in 2010 after his predecessor Mahdi Akef, who died in 2017. On April 30, the Cairo Criminal Court has reordered placing the Muslim Brotherhood organization and 1,529 defendants, including Badie, and Morsi on the terror list.

An Algerian blogger who was jailed after interviewing an Israeli diplomat has appealed his 10-year sentence, his lawyer says, after global rights groups condemned the severity of the punishment. Merzoug Touati was convicted on Thursday of providing intelligence to “agents of a foreign power” likely to damage Algeria, by a court in Bejaia, east of Algiers. The 30-year-old blogger submitted his appeal the following day and was feeling “optimistic,” his lawyer Boubakeur Esseddik Hamaili says. “I have seen my client, he is doing well and is a tower of strength. He proclaims his innocence as he has done nothing but exercise his rights guaranteed by the constitution,” the lawyer adds. Touati has been in prison since his arrest in January 2017, over an online video interview with an Israeli foreign ministry spokesman and a Facebook post in which he called for protests against a new financial law. — AFP

CAIRO, May 30 (Reuters) - Egypt’s state security prosecutor on Wednesday ordered four Egyptian officials detained for four days for questioning on suspicion of taking bribes from commodities trading firms, a judicial source said. State news agency MENA reported on Tuesday the officials had been arrested. They include the chairman of the state Food Industries Holding Company (FIHC), a supply ministry adviser responsible for coordination with parliament, a supply ministry spokesman and an official in the FIHC chairman’s office, MENA said. FIHC, a state buyer that has historically handled a broad sweep of commodities, tendering locally and internationally for staples like vegetable oils and sugar, has in recent years seen its role reduced in favour of state grain-buyer GASC. Egypt is the world’s largest importer of wheat and a major buyer of staples like corn and vegetable oils. (Reporting by Haitham Ahmed, writing by John Davison, editing by Larry King)

BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Thursday it would “open its door wider” to German businesses, giving a warm reception to visiting Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has wooed Beijing to counterbalance trade threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. Germany and China, two exporting nations that run large trade surpluses with the United States, have found themselves in Trump’s firing line and are scrambling to preserve the multi-lateral order on which their prosperity rests. Merkel faces a delicate balancing act on the trip to show Chinese-German solidarity over trade and the Iran nuclear deal without harming ties with long-term ally Washington. In the latest U.S. trade move that has alarmed Beijing and Berlin alike, the Trump administration announced on Wednesday a national security investigation on into car and truck imports that could potentially lead to tariffs. The announcement hurt share prices of both European and Asian carmakers. China vowed to protect its interests. European countries are also concerned that their exporters could be hurt if China instructs importers to buy more U.S. goods to ease trade disputes with the Trump administration. China has already signaled to state companies to buy more U.S. oil and soybeans, trade sources told Reuters. Premier Li Keqiang, in a joint media appearance with Merkel at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, said China and Germany both upheld global free trade, and stressed the huge potential for cooperation between them. Though the two countries had problems, they could be overcome, Li said. “China’s door is open. You can say it will open even wider,” Li said. Trump’s “America First” trade policy, his administration’s professed disdain for the World Trade Organization, as well as his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, have pushed China and Germany into closer alignment, German officials say. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang review the guard of honour during a welcome ceremony outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Jason Lee However, Merkel’s government also shares many of the Trump administration’s concerns about Chinese business practices, including what many Western countries say are state-backed efforts to push foreign companies to give up trade secrets. In Copenhagen, the chief executive of Maersk MAERSKb.CO, the world's biggest container shipper, said China was "becoming more and more assertive about its own agenda – a China that uses its competition laws for own benefit" in the shipping sector. “We look with concern at the growing protectionist rhetoric around the world,” Soren Skou said. “The EU will be the decisive driving force in free trade, not the least at a time when it seems the United States doesn’t want to take the lead.” “STRIDING FORWARD” Li said Beijing would protect the interests of German firms investing in China and adjust its rules if needed: “If they come across any problems during their investment, especially when it comes to legal protections, I can clearly tell you that China is striding forward to being a country with rule of law.” German companies have complained for years about barriers to the Chinese market and intellectual property theft. Merkel welcomed China’s recent announcements that it would further open its financial sector to foreign participation and reduce Chinese joint venture requirements in sectors such as automobiles. But German industry said it was now up to China to deliver on its promises of greater openness. “China must rigorously reduce the asymmetries in market access,” said Hubert Lienhard, head of the Asia Pacific Committee of German Industry (APA). Trump has also driven Europe to work more closely with China by pulling out of a 2015 deal to lift sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear program. European countries, Russia and China, all parties to the deal, are searching for a way to salvage it by continuing to offer economic benefits to Iran in return for its compliance, despite U.S. sanctions. Merkel, who personally lobbied Trump not to pull out of the pact but was rebuffed, said Germany and China were “united in the view that we do not want to put this agreement in doubt”. In a nod to China, Merkel said that if U.S. sanctions force European companies to reduce business with Iran, “this creates the possibility for others to then get more into Iran.”

News article:
German Chancellor Merkel has stressed that improved ties with China are a much-needed step toward solving international crises. Merkel's delegation is also seeking greater market access for German companies in China. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday that close cooperation between the two countries was essential to solving the world's crises. Merkel's trip to China comes amid rising tensions in both Beijing and the European Union over trade relations with the United States, as well as US President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. Merkel said both Berlin and Beijing would stand behind the existing 2015 deal that saw Tehran give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for sanctions being lifted on Iran. While admitting that the Iran deal is not perfect, Merkel added that the alternatives are even more uncertain. She also said the imposition of US sanctions could force some European countries away from business with Iran.

Merkel said she hoped for denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and that she had seen "very hopeful things recently." The chancellor told Li during their meeting at Beijing's Great Hall that there was scope for closer cooperation between Germany and China and that the two sides should hold regular bilateral meetings, not just on business and trade, but also on human rights. "Then our conversations can center on really where there are still problems, what the solutions are and what the opportunities are," Merkel said. "Then we can play our part in a global, multilateral system." Addressing the human rights situation in China, Li said the country's constitution respects human rights and added that he hoped China and Germany could discuss rights issues on a case-by-case basis. He did not mention Liu Xia, the widow of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, who has been under house arrest since 2010 without being charged with a crime. The chancellor also stressed her continued commitment to the trans-Atlantic partnership with the United States, despite facing increased tensions and less common ground with Washington. Both Berlin and Beijing have decried Trump's decision to walk away from the Iranian nuclear accord, while both also face being slapped with punitive trade tariffs by Trump administration. The chancellor is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later on Thursday for further talks. Merkel vying for greater Chinese market access On Friday, Merkel is slated to travel to China's technology hub of Shenzhen with a German business delegation. German business leaders and lawmakers have long protested the uneven playing field. Some businesses have said they feel they are being squeezed out as China's workforce reaches a higher level of expertise, albeit without always playing by international rules or respecting international copyright and patent laws. Read more: Trade: Prospect of tariffs on car imports looms as US opens probe into auto imports As a result, business leaders from Germany have requested easing conditions and introducing greater market access for firms doing business with China. Those complaints have grown more vocal in recent years, particularly as China's investment into Europe has jumped from €700 million ($819 million) in 2008 to €35 billion just eight years later. However, Merkel also lauded China for its fast-paced economic growth and its technological development during talks with Li. Trade between two sides continues to reach record highs. dm/kms (dpa, AP, Reuters)

The German chancellor rounded out her China trip with a stop in the high-tech hub of Shenzhen. Though she urged the importance of data security, Merkel kept mum about Trump's cancellation of the North Korea summit.

News article:

He is fully qualified as a lawyer in two international jurisdictions. Darius Shahtahmasebi is a New Zealand-based legal and political analyst who focuses on US foreign policy in the Middle East, Asia and Pacific region. He is fully qualified as a lawyer in two international jurisdictions. Germany has had enough of American foreign policy. Angela Merkel’s visits to Russia and China are a testament to that. On May 10, 2018, German Chancellor Angela Merkel openly said that Europe can no longer count on the United States to protect it, hinting that the European continent would begin to “take destiny into its own hands.” The comments were, of course, a direct reference to US President Donald Trump’s ludicrous but anticipated decision to completely nuke the Iranian nuclear accord, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). “It is no longer such that the United States simply protects us, but Europe must take its destiny in its own hands. That's the task of the future," Merkel reportedly said during a speech honoring French President Emmanuel Macron. Eerily enough, approximately a year ago, Merkel offered almost the exact same sentiments, stating that Europe “really must take our fate into our own hands.” In the weeks since, Merkel has certainly proved that this was no idle threat. The German chancellor has made trips to both Russia and China, and the outcomes of those meetings appear to suggest a complete restructuring of the balance of power in Europe and Asia respectively. China and Germany see eye to eye Just this Thursday, China has already said it would “open its door wider” to German businesses after giving Merkel a warm reception. Both China and Germany have a common interest in defeating Trump’s plan to kill trade surpluses that countries have with the United States, as they are both equally affected by Trump’s threats. Each time Trump opens his mouth, it seems that European and Asian businesses are instantly affected. Germany is the largest auto exporter to the US out of any European country, and is China’s biggest European trading partner which was worth $179 billion just last year alone. Both Merkel and Macron tried their hand at persuading the Trump administration not to abandon the Iranian nuclear deal completely. The leaders even issued a joint statement with British Prime Minister Theresa May, someone whose hawkish attitude towards Iran should not go unnoticed. Not surprisingly, according to Reuters, German officials have said that “Trump’s America First’ trade policy, his administration’s professed disdain for the World Trade Organization, as well as his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, have pushed China and Germany into closer alignment.” It is not clear if the Trump administration is that incompetent or if this is done on purpose, in full knowledge that its actions will only further isolate the United States on the world stage and push states that previously held more adversarial positions closer and closer together. If it is done on purpose, one has to wonder what sort of mindset is behind the leadership which is on a self-destruct mission, and how it expects to maintain its worldwide empire, all the while irking its traditional allies. It is quite clear that Trump’s decision to axe the Iran deal will only pave the way for China to take advantage of the financial opportunities flowing out of Iran if sanctions present a buffer to German interests. China has already been assisting Iran to out-maneuver US-led sanctions through, for example, the use of credit lines using the Yuan. In that context, does Donald Trump want to contain China or empower it? You can only go so far serving the interests of Saudi Arabia and Israel while ignoring strong European states who would rather ink financial deals than turn Iran into a glass crater, a strong point of difference between Merkel and say, newly appointed US national security adviser John Bolton. The lifting of sanctions on Iran already led to an increase in trade between Germany and Iran from €2.7 billion in 2014 to €3.5 billion last year. It is also worth noting that Iran will now start accepting euros for its oil in an attempt to not only avoid the US dollar, but in a move that will directly threaten it. This topic is probably best suited for another article, but it is definitely something worth keeping an eye on – and will most likely only bolster Germany’s resolve to protect Iran. Either way, Germany and China have both agreed to stick to the Iran deal. Think for a second what this means: John Bolton openly warned European companies and countries against continuing business with Iran, stating that they could be targeted by sanctions. The newly appointed ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, also immediately warned Germany directly that German companies must halt their business activities with Tehran or face sanctions. The German-Chinese announcement also came just after Iran’s leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, issued a set of demands of its own, stating that the Europeans also could not be trusted. Germany and China have essentially given the US the political middle finger in response, and arguably kowtowed to Iranian interests instead. German-Russian relations to continue Not too long ago, the US also warned Germany that sanctions may also target the German-Russia pipeline known as the Nord Stream 2 Project. If you ever needed proof that the underlying reasons for US-led wars were driven by money and natural gas, this is it. Why prevent Germany and Russia from working on this monumental project? Germany needs the gas, and Russia, relatively close-by, can supply it. Despite the fact that the two countries continue to hold a number of disputes (including sanctions that continue to target Russia), Merkel’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin demonstrates that it is still possible to meet with one’s counterpart and discuss those issues amicably, an idea that seems almost completely lost on the current Trump administration. “If you want to solve problems, you have to talk to each other,” Merkel said alongside Putin midway through the talks. One Russian presidential aide reportedly suggested that the meeting went ahead because the two world leaders now found themselves on the same page, stating that “when opinions coincide, then countries at the very least become a bit closer to one another.” According to a senior German official with knowledge of the chancellery’s strategy, rapprochement with Russia is now a core policy objective in Berlin. Polls are already suggesting that Germans trust Russia under Putin more than they trust the United States under Trump. That is some amazing 4D chess President Trump is playing. READ MORE: Trump’s withdrawal from Iran nuclear deal gives Europe a choice: Become vassals or be independent It is also worth noting that Germany did not participate in Trump, Macron, and Theresa May’s grandiose attack on Syria in April this year. Perhaps Germany is seeing less and less in common with the US, and has less of an intention of waging war to see its interests met, unlike the US, which apparently sees violence as the logical solution to all its problems. Not to mention that – agitating Germany even further – in a recent cabinet meeting in Washington attended by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Trump singled out Germany as a country not contributing enough, all the while warning that countries allegedly not paying their dues will be “dealt with.” Sheez. It should be no wonder that in this context, Germany has been secretly building a European Army of its own, already announcing the integration of its armed forces with Romania and the Czech Republic, baby steps to creating a European army under German leadership.

News article:
The billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros warned Europe that President Donald Trump has effectively destroyed its transatlantic alliance with America, and that the continent faces an "existential crisis" because of its current turmoil. Soros, 87, a Holocaust survivor from Budapest, Hungary, made the remarks in a speech on Tuesday at the European Council on Foreign Relations. He was speaking on the subject of saving the European Union from collapse. It was Trump's decision to withdraw America from the Iran nuclear deal, despite pleas from Britain, France and Germany to stick with it, that left the U.S.-Europe alliance in tatters, Soros suggested. The Iran deal's future and efficacy is now in serious doubt. "In recent weeks not just Europe but the whole world has been shocked by President Trump's actions," said Soros, whose Open Society Foundation funds pro-democracy groups across the world. "He has unilaterally withdrawn from a nuclear arms treaty with Iran thereby effectively destroying the transatlantic alliance. This development will put additional pressure of unpredictable force on an already beleaguered Europe. It is no longer a figure of speech to say that Europe is in existential danger; it is the harsh reality," said Soros. Trump's "America First" rhetoric has sparked European policymakers to reconsider the continent's relationship with the U.S., on which it has relied for decades. Trump once called NATO "obsolete." After the Second World War, and throughout the Cold War period, America was a staunch ally of non-communist Europe and a guarantor of its security against the Soviet threat, primarily through NATO. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, NATO has expanded to incorporate former Soviet states, and America maintained its role despite the end of the Cold War. But Trump has made clear that he wants NATO to be less reliant on American leadership and resources, and is urging European member states to increase their own military spending. Though still strong allies, the extent to which Europe can rely on America's unwavering support is clouded by uncertainty. The solidity of the relationship's foundation was tested by Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, which was only signed in 2015, and underlined to Europe that America's reliability is not what it once was. Turning to Europe more generally, Soros had a stark warning for the future of the European Union, which he said is in a battle to save itself amid the rising influence of populism and euroskepticism, such as in Italy, Hungary and Poland. "The European Union is in an existential crisis. Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong," Soros said, pinning the start of its downturn in fortunes on the 2008 financial crisis. "​Europe faces three pressing problems: The refugee crisis; territorial disintegrations as exemplified by Brexit; and the austerity policy that has hindered Europe's economic development," Soros said, adding that "an existential crisis is no longer a figure of speech but the harsh reality. Europe needs to do something drastic to escape it. It needs to reinvent itself." The refugee crisis is "exploited," Soros said, by "unscrupulous leaders" such as the far-right President Viktor Orban in his own native Hungary. Orban, who ran an anti-Semitic election campaign which held Soros up as a hate figure, is "posing as the defender of his version of a Christian Europe that is challenging the values on which the European Union was founded. He is trying to take over the leadership of the Christian Democratic parties, which form the majority in the European Parliament," Soros said. To overcome the likes of Orban and put the European Union back on solid ground, Soros said it must ditch its commitment to "ever-closer union" and instead "allow member states a wider variety of choices." "This would have a far-reaching beneficial effect. Right now, attitudes towards cooperation are negative: Member states want to reassert their sovereignty rather than surrender more of it," he said. "But if cooperation produced positive results, attitudes may improve and some objectives, like defense, that are currently best pursued by coalitions of the willing may qualify for universal participation. "Harsh reality may force member states to set aside their national interests in the interest of preserving the European Union," said Soros.

They also agreed to amend the existing nuclear agreement with Iran by putting additional curbs on Tehran’s weapons development program. After all these offers were rejected by Washington, EU leaders have turned to Moscow. “I do think we have to reconnect with Russia,” Juncker told an audience in Brussels. “I am not very happy with the state of our relations. We will never accept what Russia did with Crimea or eastern Ukraine. But nevertheless, we have to have in mind that the entire territory of the European Union is about 5.5 million square kilometers. Russia [is] 70.5 million [sq. km],” he added. In an interview with Sputnik, Dmitry Abzalov, director of the Center for Strategic Communications in Moscow, said that Russia should try to make the best of the situation and press for concessions from Brussels. “The EU could put Nord Stream 2 on the list of its strategic projects. A similar status for the Turkish Stream would not hurt either. If Germany and France want to work closer with Russia and will use their leverage in Ukraine, the very reason for the [anti-Russian] sanctions would be gone,” Abzalov noted. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has shown a similar readiness to reconnect with Moscow. During their recent meeting in Moscow Merkel and Putin underscored the mutual importance of going ahead with the Nord Stream 2 project. Interviewed by Sputnik, the director of the Russian Council for International Affairs Andrei Kortunov said that this was a distinct possibility. “Détente between Russia and the EU is possible. There are factors that are prodding both sides towards this. The mere fact that [French President Emmanuel] Macron and Merkel visited Moscow is a very positive sign because it had been a long time since either of them had been here. The very state of international affairs calls for a rapprochement because Moscow and Brussels see eye to eye on things like the Iranian nuclear deal and the relocation of the US embassy to Jerusalem,” Kortunov said.

News article:
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany has asked the U.S. government to clarify remarks by President Donald Trump’s new ambassador to Berlin after he told a right-wing website he wanted to empower “other conservatives” in Europe. Slideshow ( 2 images ) The comments by Richard Grenell, a former U.S. spokesman at the United Nations and an outspoken defender of Trump, drew criticism from politicians across the German political spectrum, warning him not to meddle in domestic politics. “We have asked the U.S. side for clarification, and whether (the remarks) were made as reported,” a foreign ministry spokesman said. The issue would be looked at again on Wednesday when Grenell is due to make his first official call at the ministry, the spokesman said. The political appointee caused anger on his first day in Berlin with a tweet telling German companies to wind down their business from Iran after the U.S. withdrew from a non-proliferation deal with Iran. In a further breach of protocol, Grenell also invited Austria’s Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, a critic of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s refugee policies, to an embassy lunch during his June 12 visit to Berlin, Spiegel magazine reported. Peter Launsky-Tieffenthal, spokesman for the Austrian government, dismissed criticism of the meeting with Kurz. “It is important, especially at times like these, to maintain contact with the closest associates of the U.S. president, especially on issues such as trade and transatlantic relations,” he said. In an interview with Breitbart News at the weekend, Grenell attributed the groundswell of conservatives across Europe to the “failed policies of the left”, adding: “I absolutely want to empower other conservatives throughout Europe, other leaders.” In the same interview, he described himself as a big fan of Kurz, the head of the conservative People’s Party and who shares power with the far-right Freedom Party in Vienna. An embassy spokesman said Kurz had requested the meeting. Merkel declined to comment on Kurz’s planned visit to the U.S. embassy during his visit to Berlin. “Like many others, I have taken note of this,” she said in a cool remark at a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu said that he had also had a brief meeting with Grenell during his Berlin visit. “I was asked by the American ambassador to meet him at the airport,” he said. “I wouldn’t draw any great meaning into that.” Rolf Muetzenich, deputy leader of the Social Democrats in parliament, said Grenell’s remarks should be raised quickly with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. “Clearly the U.S. ambassador sees himself as an extension of a right-wing conservative world movement,” he told Reuters. Muetzenich added that Grenell’s actions violated the 1961 Vienna Convention, under which diplomats do not interfere in the domestic affairs of a country. Grenell, like Trump an avid Twitter user, defended himself. “I stand by my comments that we are experiencing an awakening from the silent majority - those who reject the elites & their bubble. Led by Trump.” Not all German politicians have been hostile.

News article:
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany has asked the U.S. government to clarify remarks by President Donald Trump’s new ambassador to Berlin after he told a right-wing website he wanted to empower “other conservatives” in Europe. Slideshow ( 2 images ) The comments by Richard Grenell, a former U.S. spokesman at the United Nations and an outspoken defender of Trump, drew criticism from politicians across the German political spectrum, warning him not to meddle in domestic politics. “We have asked the U.S. side for clarification, and whether (the remarks) were made as reported,” a foreign ministry spokesman said. The issue would be looked at again on Wednesday when Grenell is due to make his first official call at the ministry, the spokesman said. The political appointee caused anger on his first day in Berlin with a tweet telling German companies to wind down their business from Iran after the U.S. withdrew from a non-proliferation deal with Iran. In a further breach of protocol, Grenell also invited Austria’s Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, a critic of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s refugee policies, to an embassy lunch during his June 12 visit to Berlin, Spiegel magazine reported. Peter Launsky-Tieffenthal, spokesman for the Austrian government, dismissed criticism of the meeting with Kurz. “It is important, especially at times like these, to maintain contact with the closest associates of the U.S. president, especially on issues such as trade and transatlantic relations,” he said. In an interview with Breitbart News at the weekend, Grenell attributed the groundswell of conservatives across Europe to the “failed policies of the left”, adding: “I absolutely want to empower other conservatives throughout Europe, other leaders.” In the same interview, he described himself as a big fan of Kurz, the head of the conservative People’s Party and who shares power with the far-right Freedom Party in Vienna. An embassy spokesman said Kurz had requested the meeting. Merkel declined to comment on Kurz’s planned visit to the U.S. embassy during his visit to Berlin. “Like many others, I have taken note of this,” she said in a cool remark at a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu said that he had also had a brief meeting with Grenell during his Berlin visit. “I was asked by the American ambassador to meet him at the airport,” he said. “I wouldn’t draw any great meaning into that.” Rolf Muetzenich, deputy leader of the Social Democrats in parliament, said Grenell’s remarks should be raised quickly with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. “Clearly the U.S. ambassador sees himself as an extension of a right-wing conservative world movement,” he told Reuters. Muetzenich added that Grenell’s actions violated the 1961 Vienna Convention, under which diplomats do not interfere in the domestic affairs of a country. Grenell, like Trump an avid Twitter user, defended himself. “I stand by my comments that we are experiencing an awakening from the silent majority - those who reject the elites & their bubble. Led by Trump.” Not all German politicians have been hostile. Jens Spahn, perhaps the most prominent critic of Merkel within her Christian Democratic Union party, has been photographed repeatedly with the new ambassador since he arrived in Berlin.

News article:
The Angela Merkel that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet with on Monday is not the same Angela Merkel he worked with when she first took office nine years ago. Germany’s chancellor no longer holds the reins of power in Europe. Although the Christian Democratic Union of Germany party won the last elections, it took Merkel six months to form a new government—a precedent indicative of the growing threat to the political establishment in the country. While Merkel ultimately formed a government with the rival Social Democratic Party, one cannot be sure internal tensions will allow the government to continue for very long. The face of Europe has also changed dramatically in the past two years. Many believe it is now French President Emmanuel Macron, and not Merkel, who sets the tone for the European Union. Macron aspires to introduce reforms to the E.U. that would strengthen its federal character, in particular as concerns its financial management, at the expense of the sovereignty of member states. Merkel has become the main force obstructing these reforms. The rise of the populist right, which opposes the idea of a “United States of Europe,” and supports in principle, a Europe of nation-states instead, seems to have made it clear to Merkel that if she hopes to prevent the break-up of the E.U. and the weakening of Germany’s senior status, the E.U. must navigate a new course. There is growing anti-German sentiment in France, Italy, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Even Austria is grumbling over Berlin’s seemingly authoritative role. In Germany itself, the third-largest party in the Bundestag opposes the E.U. Many of its supporters feel disappointed by Merkel, especially since she let 2 million “refugees” into Germany. Italy’s vague political future could prove significant for the E.U. in a year in which Britain is set to voluntarily leave the union. Add to that growing tension between Brussels, and Eastern and Central European states, pressure on the E.U. to accept Balkan states as members, conflicts with the E.U.’s greatest ally, the United States, and, of course, the ever-present Russian threat. A significant portion of talks Netanyahu will hold in Berlin, Paris and London will obviously center on convincing the E.U. to obligate Iran to agree to vital additions to the nuclear deal, and significantly reduce its subversive activities in the Middle East and in particular on Israel’s borders. Although there are those in the European Union who have challenged the E.U. line that holds the union must remain in the accord, countries who are set to gain financially from the deal, like France, Germany, Italy and Austria, will continue to insist the E.U. honor its commitments, i.e. business deals and investments, towards Tehran. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories One cannot ignore the fact that, in light of Iranian provocations in Syria and Palestinian provocations in the Gaza Strip, the new German government has expressed full support for Israel’s unconditional right to protect its citizens, borders and territory. This support is a stark contrast from the weak language of the E.U. Commission. This refreshing change comes not just from Merkel’s office, from which a number of officials with problematic views on Israel have recently departed, but as a result of a generational shift led by the Christian Democrats’ social democratic partner. The older generation, which had an uncontrollable urge to preach morality to Israel, was sent home. The new leadership is too busy grappling with the serious problems facing Germany and the party to worry about bringing about a new world order. Israel should begin to engage in polite discussions with this German government over the problematic nature of Germany’s involvement in Israel’s internal affairs and funding of Palestinian organizations that do nothing to promote peace. Eldad Beck is an Israeli journalist and author.

News article:
OTTAWA, WASHINGTON Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this week plays host to a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations with six of the seven members outraged at the United States over a slew of recent moves by President Donald Trump. This year’s meeting is likely to be overshadowed by Trump’s planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, tentatively scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, where Pyongyang’s nuclear program is expected to be discussed. Trudeau, who wants the June 8-9 meeting to focus on economic growth, insists he can handle the challenge, though insiders and analysts say he will have to fight to keep the grouping together at a time when Trump’s trade and diplomatic moves have isolated the United States and risk undermining the G7’s relevance. “What this G7 is going to show is that the United States are alone against everyone and especially alone against their allies,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters on Friday before a meeting of his counterparts in British Columbia. Trump’s disdain for diplomatic niceties and his “America first” policies have created a rift with countries whose alliance with the United States dates to the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Trump has infuriated Canada and European Union members of the G7 by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminium and pulling out of a deal to monitor Iran’s nuclear activities. Japan fears being sidelined in its own back yard as Washington seeks to improve ties with North Korea. The three-day G7 finance ministers’ meeting, where the closest US allies vented anger over the Trump administration’s metal import tariffs, wrapped up on Saturday with a stern rebuke of Washington. ‘More open rupture’ Trudeau played down the talk of divisions at the summit, in the Quebec town of La Malbaie. “These questions get asked every time,” Trudeau told Reuters in a May 24 interview. He said the G7 was “extraordinarily valuable because it’s an opportunity for like-minded nations to come together and talk about shared challenges.” A spokesman for Trudeau said the prime minister’s position had not changed despite the tariffs. University of Ottawa international affairs professor Roland Paris, who served as Trudeau’s first foreign policy adviser, has a less upbeat view. “The primary challenge for this summit is to maintain the integrity of the G7 itself,” he said. While the most likely scenario was that the leaders gloss over their differences, he added, “there is the real possibility of a more open rupture.” Heather Conley, a former US State Department official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the divisions on trade meant it would be hard for leaders to focus on the other issues. “They’re either going to struggle through this and remain relevant to the management of the international system as it continues to evolve — or they’re not,” she said. Trudeau and the European Union condemned the steel and aluminium tariffs, and tempers will no doubt be high on June 8 when leaders hold a traditional discussion about trade. “Obviously it has the potential to be much more robust this year,” said a senior Canadian government official, who conceded this year’s meeting would be charged. “Is it more challenging this time than before? Yes, but everyone is showing up,” said the official, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. At the G7, Trump will defend his insistence on “fair and reciprocal trade,” said a White House National Security Council official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow described the tensions over trade as a family quarrel. “This thing can work out. I’m the optimist,” he told reporters on Friday.

News article:
Richard Allen Grenell has sparked uproar just weeks into his posting as US ambassador to Berlin A member of the German government on Tuesday accused the new US ambassador in Berlin of meddling in domestic politics and aggravating already tense ties, as left-wing parties called for the staunch ally of Donald Trump to be expelled. Richard Grenell took up his Berlin posting on May 8 and immediately irked Germany when he tweeted the same day that German companies should stop doing business with Iran as Trump quit the nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic. He stoked further outrage last weekend with reported comments to right-wing news website Breitbart of his ambition to "empower other conservatives throughout Europe, other leaders." Grenell also raised eyebrows with his plan to host a June 13 lunch for Austria's arch-conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, described by the US envoy as a "rock star." The ambassador "is interfering in our internal affairs," said Peter Beyer, coordinator for transatlantic cooperation in Angela Merkel's government, in an interview with regional newspaper the Rheinische Post. "He should pay attention to the fact that we consider his start as ambassador to be difficult," added the conservative politician, who will be present on Wednesday for a visit by the diplomat to the foreign ministry. Former chief of the Social Democratic Party and ex-European Parliament president Martin Schulz told national news agency DPA: "What this man is doing is unheard of in international diplomacy. "If a German ambassador were to say in Washington that he is there to empower the Democrats, he would have been kicked out immediately. "I hope that Kurz's visit will lead Mr Grenell's tenure as ambassador in Germany to be short," added Schulz, playing on the German word for short -- "kurz." Schulz had earlier tweeted that the US envoy did not behave like a diplomat but rather like a "far-right colonial officer." Amid the row, Germany's foreign ministry is seeking clarification from Grenell about his comments, with the topic to be raised at a pre-arranged meeting Wednesday between the envoy and senior official Andreas Michaelis. "There will certainly be a lot to discuss and that's why it's good that the ambassador will be a guest tomorrow of state secretary Michaelis," said Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. - 'Awful interview' - But in Washington, the Trump administration was standing by its controversial envoy. "Ambassadors have a right to express their opinion," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters who asked whether Grenell had expressing the views of the administration. "They're representatives of the White House, whether it's this administration or other administrations, and we hear them voicing their opinions," she said. "And they're sometimes opinions that people may or may not like. And there is the right to free speech as well." The appointment of Grenell, a hawkish supporter of Trump's "America First" stance, was long held up by US senators who objected to his allegedly disparaging tweets on female politicians and apparent refusal to take seriously claims of Russian meddling in the US election. The controversy comes as ties between Germany and the United States are strained after Trump ditched the Iran nuclear deal and imposed punishing tariffs on European aluminium and steel. Underlining the souring transatlantic relationship, Merkel has warned that Europe can no longer rely on the US to protect it and must "take its destiny into its own hands." Politicians in the US too baulked at Grenell's comments. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy tweeted that the envoy's interview with Breitbart was "awful -- ambassadors aren't supposed to 'empower' any political party overseas." - 'Why is he ambassador'? - For Juergen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman of Merkel's centre-right bloc, Grenell is simply seeking to weaken the EU. The US wants to prevent "the European Union from further integrating and becoming a stronger political and economic power," Hardt told broadcaster hr-Info. Although Merkel herself belongs to the conservative camp, commentators said Grenell was not trying to bolster the chancellor's party base, but rather its opponents from the far-right. "It is bad enough if that's what he is thinking, let alone saying it," said the daily Berliner Zeitung. Media outside Germany also weighed in, with Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum arguing that Grenell clearly intended to back "nativist, pro-Russia and anti-pluralist" forces in Europe. Grenell had certainly fulfilled his task if he was sent to Germany to destabilise Merkel's coalition or the Atlantic alliance, she said, "but if those are not his orders... then a different set of questions has to be asked." "Why is the US ambassador in Germany giving an interview to Breitbart? Why is he involving himself in partisan politics? For that matter, why is he an American ambassador at all?" Applebaum added. The Financial Times urged Berlin to respond to Grenell's "undiplomatic behaviour" by holding its line on adhering to the Iran nuclear deal, responding firmly to US tariffs as well as stepping up to its defence responsibilities.

Democratic Senator Chris Murphy tweeted that the envoy's interview with Breitbart was "awful -- ambassadors aren't supposed to 'empower' any political party overseas." - 'Why is he ambassador'? - For Juergen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman of Merkel's centre-right bloc, Grenell is simply seeking to weaken the EU. The US wants to prevent "the European Union from further integrating and becoming a stronger political and economic power," Hardt told broadcaster hr-Info. Although Merkel herself belongs to the conservative camp, commentators said Grenell was not trying to bolster the chancellor's party base, but rather its opponents from the far-right. "It is bad enough if that's what he is thinking, let alone saying it," said the daily Berliner Zeitung. Media outside Germany also weighed in, with Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum arguing that Grenell clearly intended to back "nativist, pro-Russia and anti-pluralist" forces in Europe. Grenell had certainly fulfilled his task if he was sent to Germany to destabilise Merkel's coalition or the Atlantic alliance, she said, "but if those are not his orders... then a different set of questions has to be asked." "Why is the US ambassador in Germany giving an interview to Breitbart? Why is he involving himself in partisan politics? For that matter, why is he an American ambassador at all?" Applebaum added. The Financial Times urged Berlin to respond to Grenell's "undiplomatic behaviour" by holding its line on adhering to the Iran nuclear deal, responding firmly to US tariffs as well as stepping up to its defence responsibilities.

(Adds comments from Mattis' press conference, changes dateline) By Idrees Ali BRUSSELS, June 6 (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis arrived in Brussels on Wednesday seeking to mollify European allies, again finding himself in the familiar position of mending relationships frayed by President Donald Trump's policies. Trump infuriated European Union members, Canada and Mexico by imposing tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, which experts say could bleed into U.S. security relationships, even among America's closest allies. While the meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels is a routine affair, it will be watched closely in European capitals. On his debut trip to Brussels as secretary of defense last year after Trump questioned the need for NATO, Mattis told members that while they must honor military spending pledges, the alliance was "the most successful and powerful military alliance in modern history." "This ministerial is going to be overshadowed by the tariffs issue," said a U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "Mattis is going to be looking to reassure allies, try to strengthen relationships and continue to press the need for them to live up to their 2 percent commitment," the official added. The United States has been pushing NATO countries to reach a target to spend 2 percent of economic output on defense every year by 2024. Speaking with reporters on the way to Brussels, Mattis suggested that while talks with NATO partners would be tough, he did not expect Trump's tariffs decision to have an impact on defense issues for now. "Along the path going there, certainly it'll be a little rocky, a little bumpy at times, but so far I do not anticipate any effect in the security domain," he said. Barry Pavel, a U.S. national security expert at the Atlantic Council think-tank, said while issues of national security are usually unaffected by politics, Trump's decision was far too provocative not to have an impact. "I think it was such a shock and the reactions from several allies being so unprecedented and so emotional and insulted, that I think some of that will bleed into some of the discussions at the sort of geopolitical level," Pavel said. In response to Trump's decision to impose tariffs, the EU threatened tariffs on Harley Davidson motorcycles and bourbon, measures aimed at the political bases of U.S. Republican legislators. While in Brussels, Mattis will also meet his Turkish counterpart as Washington tries to balance Ankara's concerns about Kurdish fighters among U.S.-backed SDF forces trying to retake the Islamic State's remaining territory in Syria. "How do we take Turkey's legitimate security concerns and enhance their security... at the same time, the SDF was the only organization at the time that was able to throw ISIS off the track and defeat them in the field in very, very tough fighting and we will not simply cast that organization aside," Mattis said. Turkey and the United States on Monday endorsed a roadmap for the northern Syrian city of Manbij and underlined their mutual commitment to its implementation. WANING INFLUENCE? The informal portfolio of soothing traditional U.S. friends upset by Trump's often sharp comments and tweets on foreign policy is one that the retired Marine general is becoming used to. Less than a week ago in Asia, Mattis attempted to do much the same with allies Japan and South Korea, where some officials are concerned that Trump may put U.S. security interests ahead of theirs in pursuing a peace deal with North Korea. In recent months, however, there have been growing questions about whether Mattis' voice in internal administration debates could increasingly be drowned out by those of other advisers and the president himself, who increasingly trusts his own instincts. In one notable instance, Mattis publicly suggested sticking with the Iran nuclear deal. Dismayed European allies also sought to salvage the Iran nuclear deal and preserve their Iranian trade after Trump withdrew the United States from the landmark accord and ordered sanctions reimposed on Tehran.

News article:
Jens Stoltenberg warned that splits between America and European NATO members over trade is threatening the alliance NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday he was battling to stop the increasingly bitter row between Europe and the US spilling over into the alliance, warning of 'serious disagreements' among member countries. European countries are at loggerheads with Washington over punishing new US tariffs on steel and aluminium as well as President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord. NATO defence ministers will meet in Brussels on Thursday to approve plans to beef up the alliance's ability to mobilise forces quickly in the event of a crisis, as concern about the threat from Russia shows no sign of abating. They will also sign off on two new command centres - one to protect Atlantic shipping lanes, based in Norfolk, Virginia, and another to coordinate troop movements around Europe, located in the southern German city of Ulm. But the meeting, just five weeks out from a full summit of NATO leaders, looks set to be overshadowed by the spat between European countries and their longtime ally across the Atlantic. 'There are now serious disagreements with NATO allies on serious issues,' Stoltenberg told reporters, saying he was working hard to minimise the fallout. 'As long as they're not solved I have to be focused on how to reduce, limit the negative consequences for NATO.' Stoltenberg, who held talks with Trump in Washington last month, insisted the 'transatlantic bond' remained strong and pointed to the way NATO survived major differences among members over the Iraq war in 2003 and the Suez crisis of 1956. President Trump has angered allies in the EU by imposing steep trade tariffs on aluminium and steel, with the trading bloc vowing to retaliate 'What we have seen again and again is that we have been able to unite around NATO's core task, to protect and defend each other despite those differences,' he said. The US ambassador to NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchison, insisted 'the strength of our alliance is not in jeopardy'. The Suez crisis In 1956 Britain, France and Israel invaded Egypt in an attempt to regain control of the Suez Canal which had been nationalized by Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser. While the invasion was a tactical success it led Egypt to close the canal to shipping, which drew the ire of the United States and Soviet Union. Heavy political pressured from the US and USSR, including the threat by President Eisenhower to crash the British economy by selling off government bonds, eventually led the invaders to withdraw. Advertisement 'We are strong together, we will have disagreements on other issues but we will not have disagreement about the strength of NATO and the importance of deterrence and defence for NATO and for North America,' she told reporters. The leaders of all 29 NATO members will meet in Brussels for the summit in July when all eyes will be on Trump, who has repeatedly attacked European countries for not pulling their weight in the alliance. Germany, Europe's largest economy, has suffered the worst of Trump's wrath for its failure to live up to a pledge by all NATO countries to try to spend at least two percent of gross domestic product on defence. NATO is modernising its command structure and beefing up its defences in response to growing fears about Russia, following Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Thousands of NATO troops are already stationed on standby in the Baltic states and Poland as deterrent and on Thursday defence ministers will give the go-ahead to a new US initiative called '30-30-30-30' or 'four 30s'. Under the plan, by 2020 NATO will have 30 batallions, 30 air squadrons and 30 warships ready to be used within 30 days to back up existing rapid response forces. 'This is about establishing a culture of readiness and we need that because we have a more unpredictable security environment, we have to be prepared for the unforeseen,' Stoltenberg said.

News article:
LA MALBAIE, Quebec (Reuters) - The United States and European Union will establish a dialogue on trade within the next two weeks, a French official said on Friday, signaling a modest step forward for bitterly divided allies at a Group of Seven summit in Canada. U.S. trading partners have been furious over President Donald Trump’s decision last week to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, the European Union and Mexico as part of his “America First” agenda. Some countries have retaliated with their own levies on U.S. imports. “The principle of a dialogue was agreed this afternoon,” the French official told reporters. “Everyone agreed, including President Trump.” While G7 leaders confronted Trump with a slew of data on imports and exports in a bid to sway his thinking, Trump countered his own numbers and held his position that the United States was at a disadvantage on international trade, an official who followed the talks said. But Trump struck a more affable tone after a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, saying the French leader was helping work out trade issues. “Something’s going to happen. I think it will be very positive,” Trump said, without giving details. Macron said it was possible to advance the trade issues that have split the U.S. and its allies. “I think, on trade, there is ... a way to progress all together,” he told reporters after his meeting with Trump. “I saw the willingness on all the sides to find agreements and have a win-win approach for our people, our workers, and our middle classes.” German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday floated an idea to set up a way to resolve trade disputes between the United States and its allies. An official described Merkel’s suggestion as a “shared assessment and dialogue” mechanism, but gave no further details. It was unclear if the technical talks were part of her initiative. The proposal was supported by other leaders present, the official said. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker offered to visit Washington for an assessment of EU-US trade to help resolve the dispute, an official said. Expectations for a major breakthrough on trade at the summit, however, remain low, with U.S. allies focused on avoiding rupturing the G7, which in its 42-year history has tended to seek consensus on major issues. “It’s highly unlikely there will be a final communique,” a G7 official said on condition of anonymity. Merkel said it was not clear whether the group would issue a final directive, adding that failure to do so would be an honest reflection of the lack of agreement among Canada, the United States, Japan, Britain, Italy, France and Germany. The EU is also attending the summit. Trump had set a combative tone before leaving Washington on Friday, saying he was “going to deal with the unfair trade practices” of other G7 members. But he was more affable after meeting Macron and Trudeau, swapping jokes with the latter before the media though neither budged on their trade positions. “We’ve had really a very good relationship, very special,” the U.S. president said of Macron, a day after the two leaders had exchanged terse messages on Twitter. “We have little tests every once in a while when it comes to trade.” Merkel and Trump also had a brief conversation at the summit but no bilateral meeting. Slideshow ( 14 images ) Trump’s “America First” message to allies has hardened since he brought hardline national security adviser John Bolton on to his team. Trump plans to leave the summit four hours earlier than originally planned to fly to Singapore to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the White House said. G7 chiefs have largely praised Trump for his efforts to stabilize the Korean peninsula, but they are unhappy he pulled out of an international agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Slideshow ( 14 images ) INVESTORS NERVOUS Canada and the EU have denounced the U.S. tariffs and Ottawa has proposed levies on a range of U.S. goods next month while the EU has pledged its own retaliatory measures. British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday warned both Trump and the EU of the dangers of entering a tit-for-tat trade war over tariffs, urging both sides to instead focus on China’s excess steel production. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said her country “will not change its mind when it comes to the illegal” application of tariffs. The spat has financial markets worried about tit-for-tit escalation. Investors are also concerned about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump has threatened to terminate. Canada and Mexico, the other members of the 1994 pact, have been frustrated by the slow pace of talks to renegotiate NAFTA. A Canadian official said Trump and Trudeau discussed accelerating NAFTA talks. RUSSIA’S SHADOW Relations with Russia also became an issue at the summit after Trump on Friday said the country should be allowed to again attend meetings with the G7, an idea that did not gain much traction at the meeting and was not formally raised. Russia was suspended from group in 2014 because of its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Trump said Russia should be readmitted, but even Moscow seemed to reject that suggestion. Merkel said EU countries at the summit agreed that the conditions to readmit Russia had not been met. Trump’s presidency has been clouded by a federal investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, and possible collusion by his campaign. Both Moscow and Trump have denied the allegations.

The spat has financial markets worried about tit-for-tit escalation. Investors are also concerned about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump has threatened to terminate. Canada and Mexico, the other members of the 1994 pact, have been frustrated by the slow pace of talks to renegotiate NAFTA. A Canadian official said Trump and Trudeau discussed accelerating NAFTA talks. RUSSIA’S SHADOW Relations with Russia also became an issue at the summit after Trump on Friday said the country should be allowed to again attend meetings with the G7, an idea that did not gain much traction at the meeting and was not formally raised. Russia was suspended from group in 2014 because of its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Trump said Russia should be readmitted, but even Moscow seemed to reject that suggestion. Merkel said EU countries at the summit agreed that the conditions to readmit Russia had not been met. Trump’s presidency has been clouded by a federal investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, and possible collusion by his campaign. Both Moscow and Trump have denied the allegations.

News article:
European leaders are fighting back against U.S. President Donald Trump after the American leader threw a summit of the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrialized nations into disarray by withdrawing his endorsement of a statement he initially had accepted. Late on June 9, Trump tweeted that based on “false statements” by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who hosted the G7 summit in Quebec, he had instructed U.S. representatives not to endorse the final communique, which the Canadian leader had said was agreed to by all G7 nations. In recent weeks, trading partners of the United States have criticized new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports imposed by the Trump administration. At a news conference after the summit, Trudeau reiterated his opposition to the U.S. tariffs and vowed to "move forward with retaliatory measures" in July. "I have made it very clear to the president that it is not something we relish doing, but it something that we absolutely will do," he said. "Canadians, we're polite, we're reasonable, but we also will not be pushed around." As Trump flew from the summit to a planned meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, he lashed out at Trudeau, saying he “acted so meek and mild during our G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, ‘US Tariffs were kind of insulting’ and he ‘will not be pushed around.’” “Very dishonest & weak. Our Tariffs are in response to his of [sic] 270% on dairy!” Trump wrote. Trudeau’s office released a statement quoting the prime minister as saying that he said nothing at the G7 that he hadn’t told Trump in person and voiced publicly before. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on June 10 that Trump's revocation of support for the joint communique was "sobering and a little depressing." "It's hard, it's depressing this time, but that's not the end" of the G7, she said in an interview with ARD public television, adding that the European Union is preparing countermeasures against U.S. tariffs. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas made a veiled barb at Trump, tweeting: "With one tweet, an unsettling amount of trust can be very quickly destroyed." "It is even more important that Europe stands together and even more aggressively represents its interests," Maas added. In Paris, a French presidency official said France and Europe stood by the G7 communique and anyone departing from the commitments made at the summit would be showing their "incoherence and inconsistency." "International cooperation cannot depend on being angry and on sound bites. Let's be serious," the official said. But Trump's economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told CNN that Trudeau "stabbed us in the back." "There is a special place in hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door," White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox News. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland later said that Canada "does not conduct its diplomacy through ad hominem attacks." "We don't think that that is a useful or productive way to do business, and perhaps we refrain particularly from ad hominem attacks when it comes to our relationship with our allies," she added. The eight-page G7 communique issued earlier stated that “we stand ready to take further restrictive measures to increase costs on Russia” if its behavior makes it necessary. It also demanded that Russia "cease its destabilizing behavior, to undermine democratic systems, and its support of the Syrian regime." The communique was issued after tumultuous summit that mainly had Washington squaring off against its longtime allies over Russia, trade, climate issues, and the Iran nuclear accord. Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed criticism by the G7 as "creative babbling" and said at a summit in China on June 10 that it was time for all sides to resume cooperation. "I believe it's necessary to stop this creative babbling and shift to concrete issues related to real cooperation," Putin told reporters when asked to comment on the joint statement. He added that the G7 countries had "again" failed to provide any evidence that Russia was behind the poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter in Britain in March. Because of the disputes, many observers were not certain a statement would be issued under all seven countries' names. Still, the meeting did not appear to bring the sides much closer together. The G7 consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, and the United States. Trump had shocked many of allies with repeated calls for Russia to be readmitted into the group, which was known as the G8 when Moscow was a member of the association of the world’s leading industrial nations. Trump told journalists on June 9 that "it would be an asset to have Russia back in." In response, Putin said on June 10 that Russia did not choose to leave the group and would be happy to see its member countries in Moscow. He also said he's ready to meet with Trump once the White House is ready for a summit. Many states have voiced an interest in hosting the meeting, including Austria, Putin said. It would be the first bilateral summit between the two leaders since Trump took office in January 2017. Trump and Putin have only ever spoken briefly on the sidelines of major events. European Union countries, which make up four of the group's seven members, agreed ahead of the summit that "a return of Russia to the G7-format summits can't happen until substantial progress has been made in connection with the problems with Ukraine," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said as the summit began on June 8. At the summit's end, Trudeau said he told Trump that he was "not remotely interested" in seeing Russia return to the G7. British Prime Minister Theresa May also welcomed that the G7 statement recognized the need to maintain sanctions on Russia. The statement made no reference to Russia being invited back into the G7, but the leaders did say they would continue "to engage with Russia on addressing regional crises and global challenges, where it is in our interests." Russia was expelled from the group four years ago after annexing Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and fueling a war in eastern Ukraine that has killed at least 10,300 people. Trump was asked if he thought Russia's control over Crimea should be recognized by the international community, but he avoided answering directly and instead blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the situation. "Crimea was let go during the Obama administration and, you know, Obama can say all he wants, but he allowed Russia to take Crimea," Trump said. "But, with that being said," he added, "it's been done a long time." Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on June 9 said Moscow was not seeking to rejoin the group. He added that Russia was "working fine in other formats," such as the G20. Although Merkel said the “common view" in Europe was to continue to exclude Russia, Italy's new prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, echoed Trump's call for returning Russia to the "negotiating table" in a post on Twitter. U.S. allies said they were stunned by Trump's friendly gesture toward Russia, especially considering his move last month to cite "national security" reasons for threatening to impose tariffs on the steel imports of major U.S. allies. Many U.S. lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, have also expressed concern about Trump's departure from past U.S. views on trade, Russia, and the international order. Trump has been open on his desires for better relations with Moscow. Republican Senator John McCain, who has been at loggerheads with Trump over many issues lately, tweeted his displeasure at the president’s actions in Quebec. “To our allies: bipartisan majorities of Americans remain pro-free trade, pro-globalization & supportive of alliances based on 70 years of shared values. Americans stand with you, even if our president doesn’t,” he wrote. The G7 leaders also said they were "committed to permanently ensuring that Iran's nuclear program remains peaceful in line with its international obligations and commitments to never seek, develop, or acquire a nuclear weapon." "We condemn all financial support of terrorism including terrorist groups sponsored by Iran. We also call upon Iran to play a constructive role by contributing to efforts to counter terrorism and achieve political solutions, reconciliation, and peace in the region," the statement added. It did not specifically mention the 2015 nuclear accord, which provided Tehran with relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear program. Trump withdrew from the pact in May against the wishes of the allies and Russia and China. With reporting by AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters, and the BBC

News article:
President Donald Trump arrived in Quebec, Canada Friday for what is likely to be an incredibly tense meeting of the economic superpowers known as the Group of 7 (G7) — Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, and the U.S. The meeting is expected to be tense, and this is largely Trump’s fault. Some experts have even dubbed the meeting the G6+1 to mark how isolated Trump has become from the other world leaders. In recent weeks, he has imposed a number of punitive tariffs on the European Union and Canada, which only served to heighten the tension between the U.S. and its allies that has been brewing since Trump announced he was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement. On Friday, Trump suggested that Russia should be reinstated in the group, despite its expulsion in 2014 for President Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea. Trump faces a tough crowd of his own making. In the days leading up to the summit, he’s fumed about his fellow G7 leaders, and in some cases they’ve bitten back. Here are some choice quotes in the war of words. ‘We don’t mind being six, if needs be’ Tensions continued to mount as Trump headed to Canada on Friday morning. Hours before, French President Emmanuel Macron offered a veiled warning to his U.S. counterpart, who had continued to mouth off against his G7 peers. “Maybe the American president doesn’t care about being isolated today, but we don’t mind being six, if needs be,” Macron said, per Reuters.

It was apparently a reference to the War of 1812, in which case it was erroneous — it was the British who did it. Story continues ‘If we explained to people how sausages were made, it’s unlikely they’d keep eating them’ This was Macron after a phone call with Trump that White House aides described as “terrible.” Macron declined to share his own sentiments on the phone call, invoking the Prussian statesman Otto von Bismarck in a conversation with reporters. “So I like it when people see the finished meal, but I’m not convinced the kitchen commentary helps with delivering the meal or eating it.” ‘Unjustified and deeply disappointing’ This is how British Prime Minister Theresa May described Trump’s latest tariffs on steel and aluminum coming out of Europe. The comment underscored the awkward tensions rising between the U.S. and one of its oldest allies. ‘There will be difficult discussions’ German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed cynicism earlier this week about her prospects for the G7 summit, slyly faulting the Trump administration for its abandoning of old allegiances. “We have a serious problem with multilateral agreements, and that’s why there will be contentious discussions”, she said, per AFP.

News article:
The main adversary is China. China is a big guy, and it is outside the G7. The other big guy is Russia, who is also outside the G7, although Trump today said that Russia might return to the G7. This is a policy choice still now, the US wanted to corner Russia and give some sweeteners to China. Now there is a change of policy with the Trump administration and they are courting Russia and they want to marginalize China. The rest of the G7 are mostly Western powers and they are so weak toward the US that essentially they can’t do much, although they will probably pay the price for the US trade wars. Sputnik: Do you think, as some are suggesting, that we are witnessing the emergence of a post-US world order? Macron himself said just yesterday that the US is no longer the sole economic superpower and alluded to the possibility of the US being sidelined at the G7. Stavros Mavroudeas: There is such a possibility, although France, and Macron especially, is just a joker. Macron especially is not significant. He tries… to court Germany… but he has no significant leverage. But for the US there is a growing danger that it might lose its superpower status and for this reason the Trump administration is moving so as to avoid this development. Sputnik: Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that he had "warned" Europe years ago about the risk of Washington imposing trade rules on others. Do you think it’s possible that Europe could gravitate toward Russia, in the long run?

Frankfurt – One viral photo is telling it all about tensions at the G-7 summit. A picture of U.S. President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel displaying less-than-friendly body language is turning out to be a defining image of the contentious meeting of the Group of Seven leaders of the world’s advanced economies. The picture, snapped Saturday by German government photographer Jesco Denzel, shows a standing Merkel with her hands firmly planted on a table staring down at Trump, who is seated with his arms folded and eyes glaring. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stands next to Trump, also with folded arms, as French President Emmanuel Macron leans in next to Merkel. The photo was tweeted by Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert. Shortly afterward, the White House issued a separate photo showing a sitting Trump speaking as Merkel, Abe and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau listen. The BBC parsed the picture by identifying all nine individuals in it, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, who is barely visible, and Larry Kudlow, head of Trump’s National Economic Council as well as several Japanese officials and U.S. national security adviser John Bolton. Another image of the same gathering however suggests a more relaxed interaction, with Merkel smiling and Trump making eye contact. The G-7 — an informal annual summit of democracies with highly developed economies — took place Friday and Saturday in the Quebec resort town of Charlevoix in Canada, which holds the rotating leadership this year. Saturday’s picture was not the first awkward moment between Trump and Merkel, who makes no secret of her disagreement with the American leader’s approach on trade, his rejection of the deal to limit Iran’s nuclear program and his decision to take the United States out of the global Paris deal to fight climate change. Merkel’s March 2017 visit to the White House was marked by Trump either not hearing or ignoring her offer to shake hands in the Oval Office. A subsequent visit in April this year warranted only a working lunch for the German leader, several days after fellow EU leader Macron got the full, formal state dinner treatment from Trump. The Charlevoix G-7 summit was marked by sharp disagreements over Trump’s decision to impose higher import taxes on aluminum and steel imports. The measure hits EU trading partners even though the main target is overcapacity at state-backed Chinese producers, who Europe and the U.S. have long complained have flooded markets with cheap steel. The G-7 summit participants managed to patch over their disagreements and agree to disagree on some issues in a joint final statement. Yet after leaving the summit, Trump tweeted that he would instruct U.S. officials not to endorse the G-7 statement, after objecting to comments from summit host Trudeau.

News article:
The G7 finished up on Saturday in Canada after one of the group’s most challenging summits. Far from serving as the latest annual affirmation that key western powers are aligned, the session showcased significant splits and occasional remarkable personal animosity between US President Donald Trump and other leaders. On a range of issues from trade to climate change and Iran, the US president — who made a pre-scheduled decision to leave the summit in Quebec early on Saturday — appears to be dividing from G7 partners at a time of significant geopolitical and international economic turbulence giving rise to talk of a “G6 plus 1”. And this shift was given added spice in recent days by a spate of undiplomatic language, including Trump’s characterisation of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as “so indignant” while the latter called the US president’s trade tariffs “laughable”. To be sure, G7 policy fissures did not begin with Trump’s election in 2016, but they have been exacerbated by it. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, there have been a series of intra-western disagreements, from Middle Eastern issues — including the Iraq war opposed in 2003 by France and Germany — through to the rise of China with some European powers and the United States having disagreements over the best way to engage the rising super power. Yet, despite occasional discord, G7 states generally continued to agree until the Trump presidency around a broad range of issues such as international trade; backing for a Middle Eastern peace process between Israel and the Palestinians along Oslo principles; plus strong support for the international rules-based system and the supranational organisations that make this work. Yet today, more of these key principles are being disrupted if not outright undermined by Trump’s agenda. Take the example of international trade which saw Trump isolated in Canada following the US imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports against all its G7 partners. The tensions over trade are especially salient for the G7 hosts Canada given that Trump also warned, again, last week that he is considering scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). In this contentious context, Trudeau pushed an agenda at the summit that included trade, tackling income and gender equality, female empowerment, climate change, and peace and security. With the Trump tensions, discussion over numerous of these issues was stymied — as proved the case last year at the Italian-hosted event too. In this atmosphere of discord, significant emphasis was put at the meeting on finding greater G7 consensus on a range of security and geopolitical issues. Examples here included the upcoming Singapore summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, plus the continuing clampdown against Daesh (the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) in Syria and Iraq. Despite Trump calling Friday for Russia to be allow to rejoin the group (as the G8), as was the case from 1997 to 2013, G7 leaders called for a “rapid and unified” response to malign international interference, including by Moscow, such as cyber and chemical weapon attacks like those recently in Salisbury, England. Despite the US president’s desire for warmer ties with Vladimir Putin, there is little sign that Russia will be invited back to the club any time soon after being told it can only rejoin if “it changes course and an environment is once again created in which it is possible for the G8 to hold reasonable discussions.” The G7 also expressed concerns over the process leading to the re-election of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Western leaders remain worried about the destabilising geopolitical and economic impact of the Caracas crisis for the wider region, including bordering states of Brazil and Colombia, and the fact that Venezuela is the third-largest oil exporter to the United States and has the world’s largest proven oil reserves. The G7’s emphasis on such issues underlines, yet again, the group’s often under-appreciated importance as an international security linchpin — despite the fact that it was originally conceived in the 1970s to monitor developments in the world economy and assess macroeconomic policies. Last year’s Italy summit, for instance, was dominated by the aftermath of the Manchester terrorist attacks and development of a new G7 terrorism action plan; plus the-then brewing nuclear tensions on the Korean peninsula. In Italy, Trump also pushed other G7 members for Nato to become a full member of the global coalition against Daesh. The G7’s involvement in this multitude of geopolitical dialogues is not without controversy given its original macroeconomic mandate. For instance, China strongly objected to discussion of maritime security in Asia at the 2016 Japan-hosted summit. It is sometimes asserted, especially by developing countries, that the G7 lacks the legitimacy of the UN to engage in these geopolitical issues, and/or is a historical artefact given the rise of new powers, including China and India. However, it is not the case that the international security role of the G7 is new. An early example of the linchpin function the body has played here was in the 1970s and 1980s when it helped coordinate Western strategy towards the then-Soviet Union. Moreover, following the September 2001 terrorist attacks, the then-G8 (including Russia) assumed a key role in the US-led ‘campaign against terrorism’. Taken overall, this year’s G7 saw significant splits, especially on trade. While some of these fissures pre-date the Trump presidency, his agenda has grown these gaps into what could soon become unprecedented strains in the western alliance.

The G7 finished up on Saturday in Canada after one of the group’s most challenging summits. Far from serving as the latest annual affirmation that key western powers are aligned, the session showcased significant splits and occasional remarkable personal animosity between US President Donald Trump and other leaders. On a range of issues from trade to climate change and Iran, the US president — who made a pre-scheduled decision to leave the summit in Quebec early on Saturday — appears to be dividing from G7 partners at a time of significant geopolitical and international economic turbulence giving rise to talk of a “G6 plus 1”.

© Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg U.S. Isolationism Migration Tensions Chancellor Angela Merkel made a forceful pitch for Europe to play a more assertive role in global affairs as U.S. President Donald Trump dismantles the post-World War II order, setting the stage for a potential tense standoff at the Group of Seven summit this week.The German leader again questioned the durability of trans-Atlantic relations by referring to eye-raising comments she made over a year ago in which she said that "the times when we could fully rely on others are to some extent over." Those words, spoken at a beer-tent election rally, were a reaction to Trump hectoring European leaders for not spending enough on defense at a North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels. Since then, more fuel has been added to the fire."That was my takeaway from the NATO summit, and in the meantime I continue to feel confirmed by my statement," Merkel said in Munich on Wednesday, this time to a meeting of the European People's Party, a grouping of center-right parties in the European Parliament.In addition to the disruptive effects of the rift in NATO and Trump's exit from the Paris global climate treaty, Merkel pointed to the fresh conflict over trade and the U.S. leader's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear accord last month.Merkel told the EPP.The German chancellor has taken a firmer stance leading up to the two-day G-7 gathering in Canada, which starts Friday. Earlier on Wednesday, Europe's most experienced government leader vowed to challenge Trump on trade and climate, saying the lack of room for compromise means leaders may fail to agree on a final statement.Trump's "America First" doctrine shows that "we have a serious problem with multilateral agreements," Merkel told German lawmakers, adding that failure to reach common ground could lead to the highly unusual step of host Canada issuing a concluding statement not agreed to by all participants.With Trump's unpredictable leadership and the U.S. turn toward isolationism , Merkel said that the European Union needs to hone its response to a raft of issues in an environment in which global institutions need to be "newly proven."The 28-member bloc -- soon to lose the U.K. after the 2016 referendum to exit the EU -- managed to grapple with a financial meltdown and the biggest influx of refugees since World War II only with "great effort," Merkel said. "But we don't have a sufficient foundation to confront crises of the future," she added, underscoring her push for reforms.To give the region more political heft, she called for joint action on security and migration, saying the bloc should "Europeanize" its presence on the United Nations Security Council. A rotating group of about 10 member states could work with veto-power France and the European Commission in order to "speak with one European voice" on the global stage, the chancellor said.The effort involves resolving tensions over migration. The contentious issue has driven a wedge between states calling for asylum seekers to be distributed within the bloc and those -- particularly in central and eastern Europe -- insisting migrants must be kept out.Merkel said, citing freedom of movement across the EU's borders.

News article:
Belgian politician Alain Destexhe from the Reformist Movement party believes that the summit was a failure because of Trudeau's jibe at the United States. "Justin Trudeau has played with fire. There was an agreement. Why on earth does he feel he has to add a layer of insults and personal attacks on Donald Trump in the closing press conference? It is childish. Trudeau is responsible for this failure," Destexhe told Sputnik. Transatlantic Partnerships in Disarray The G7 summit showed clearly that the transatlantic alliance is not in the best shape at the moment, torn apart by squabbles over trade and defense spending, Sebastien Cochard, a member of the National Rally party in France, told Sputnik. "The G7 discussions were just another blow to the transatlantic alliance. The explicit US threats of secondary sanctions on EU companies in commercial relations with Iran or Russia were already a big thing," Cochard said. Washington's insistence that all NATO members should spend the required 2 percent of their GDP on defense is another sore point, according to Cochard. READ MORE: 'Trump Can Get Away With a Lot of This': Scholar Shares His Views on G7 Summit At the same time, "Europe has never been as unanimous as it is now," although EU countries are not in complete agreement on trade with China or Russia, Hendrik Vos, a European politics professor at Ghent University told Sputnik. "In the past, you saw European countries that did not dare to condemn the US. That time is over, yet the disagreements within the EU are high when it comes to the future and our economic ties with China or Russia," Vos said. Start Negotiating The Europeans should begin serious negotiations with Trump based on the "protected exchange" model rather than unrestrained free trade, Prof. Gilles Lebreton, a French member of the Europe of Nations and Freedom Group (ENF) at the European Parliament, said. "Europeans should begin to negotiate seriously with Trump on the basis of the new "protected exchange" model, rather than cling to their dogma of unbridled free trade. [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel will probably understand it sooner than [French President Emmanuel] Macron (too dogmatic) because she has a good handle on German interests," Lebreton told Sputnik. Germany is not likely to respond to Trump's tariffs out of fear to hurt its own car exports, Cochard noted. "I do not expect any retaliatory move, as Germany is too scared to be submitted to subsequent retaliation from the US. Germany is in particular scared to see its precious car exports submitted to tariffs by the US. Such an action from the US would compromise German's economic export-oriented model," the French politician said. READ MORE: G7 Summit Participants Managed to Find 'Common Ground' Despite Debates — UK PM Trump was right to introduce tariffs, considering the trade imbalance between the European Union and the United States, Marcel de Graaff, a Dutch politician and a co-chairman of the Europe of Nations and Freedom Group (ENF) in the European Parliament said. "Given the trade imbalance between the US and the EU, Mr. Trump is absolutely right to take measures. The EU is a failed project. The European Commission has no position at all to lecture Mr. Trump. The UK should disembark from this sinking ship as soon as possible and join the winning team," de Graaf told Sputnik. Return to G8 Trump went against the grain in urging for the return to G8, a format that included G7 states and Russia. The reactions of other G7 members varied: Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte backed the call for the G8 restoration. Trudeau dismissed the idea as something of little interest at the moment.

* U.S. official seeks to explain Trump's actions in speech * Europeans deeply concerned by withdrawal from Iran deal By Robin Emmott BRUSSELS, June 21 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's tough stance on Iran, new tariffs on European Union metal imports and U.S. demands for higher defence spending in Europe are part of a strategy to strengthen the West, a senior U.S. official said on Thursday. Wess Mitchell, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, said that without such actions, U.S. and European diplomatic and military leadership would be overtaken by China, Russia and Iran. "Taking strong positions on these issues may not always lead to immediate agreement. But the long term costs of neglecting these things far outweigh political unity," Mitchell told European and NATO officials, in a rare speech by a Trump administration official in Brussels. European leaders are deeply worried by Trump's foreign policy and his "America first" rhetoric, while his May 8 decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal undermined an agreement prized by Europeans. A Group of Seven summit in Canada earlier this month laid bare tensions between NATO allies after Trump's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the European Union and Canada on national security grounds. Mitchell, who studied in Berlin and speaks German, sought to place Trump's decisions into a coherent policy plan that would benefit European countries because Trump was acting decisively to bring change, rather than relying on endless negotiations. "In all of these areas, with Iran, defence spending, trade, we are committed to finding a common way forward, we are committing to acting. We can debate, we can strategise, we can coordinate, but we must act," he said. "In the actions we take, we are hoping to spur a multilateral response to address some of the world's toughest challenges," Mitchell said at the Carnegie Europe think-tank gathering in Brussels. Mitchell said U.S. import tariffs on European goods would end "structural trade imbalances and predatory trade practices" in U.S.-EU trade, which would weaken the West if they continue. Reimposing sanctions on Iran by withdrawing from the Iran nuclear accord would help stop Tehran's missile programme and limit the regional reach of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, he said. Mitchell also repeated Trump's central message to NATO that European allies must spend 2 percent of economic output a year on defence to rebuild "atrophied European militaries." Trump is expected at a NATO summit in Brussels in July, a year since he first came to the alliance and publicly admonished allies for not spending enough on defence. Many EU and NATO diplomats now view the U.S. president as an unknown quantity with a lack of interest in the transatlantic ties that Europe and Canada cherish, and who is unnecessarily stoking a global trade war that will hurt economic growth.

* U.S. official seeks to explain Trump's actions in speech * Europeans deeply concerned by withdrawal from Iran deal By Robin Emmott BRUSSELS, June 21 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's tough stance on Iran, new tariffs on European Union metal imports and U.S. demands for higher defence spending in Europe are part of a strategy to strengthen the West, a senior U.S. official said on Thursday. Wess Mitchell, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, said that without such actions, U.S. and European diplomatic and military leadership would be overtaken by China, Russia and Iran.

News article:
HAPPENING TODAY: Mattis is scheduled to have lunch today with Trump at the White House. The Pentagon says Mattis, who is just back from his trip to China, as well as consultations with allies South Korea and Japan, is said to have basically cleared his schedule to prepare for the NATO summit July 11-12. Tonight, Trump delivers remarks at the Salute to Service dinner in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. POMPEO TO PYONGYANG: The White House yesterday confirmed reports from last week that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will leave for North Korea on Thursday for a meeting with Kim Jong Un and his “team.” Pompeo will be seeking specific commitments and timetables for North Korea to show it’s serious about meeting a vague commitment it made last month in Singapore “to work towards complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” The White House yesterday refused to confirm widely reported U.S. intelligence assessments that the North was preparing to conceal the extent of its nuclear arsenal and related programs. “We aren’t going to confirm or deny any intelligence reports,” said press secretary Sarah Sanders. “What I can tell you is that we’re continuing to make progress. In the last eight months, you haven’t seen missile launches. You haven’t seen nuclear detonations. And again, these conversations are continuing to evolve.” Pompeo plans to wrap up his talks in Pyongyang in time to joint Trump and Mattis at the NATO summit in Brussels. BEIJING BRUSH OFF: Meanwhile, China is dismissing those intel assessments, touting instead the “momentum” behind the denuclearization process. “I don’t know where they come from or on what basis those U.S. officials made the relevant comments,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said. “I think you may have to seek clarification from them.” THE ‘CODSPREY’ COMETH: U.S. troops and supplies will have a new way to arrive on aircraft carriers now that the Pentagon has inked a new $4 billion aircraft contract. The contract with Boeing and Bell Helicopter includes 39 of a new Navy variant of the Osprey aircraft, called the CMV-22B, that would land on the massive ship decks and act as a transport. The Marine Corps is set to get 34 of its own “B” variant Osprey aircraft and Japan will buy four under the contract. The carrier transport job is now handled by C-2A Greyhound turboprop aircraft that make catapult launches, harrowing dives and jarring arrested stops onto the carriers. Known as the carrier onboard delivery aircraft, or COD, the Greyhounds were introduced in the 1960s and have had a stellar safety record, despite last year’s emergency water landing in the Philippine Sea that claimed the lives of three crew members. But the CODs were notoriously hot, noisy and uncomfortable, with passengers strapped in backward and given only two small porthole windows. The new “Codsprey” CMV-22B tilt-rotor aircraft will have an enlarged fuel tank for longer range and be able to hover and land on the carriers like a helicopter. HIGH-POWERED ARMY LASER: It may be only a $10 million defense contract, but who doesn’t love laser weapons? Raytheon announced it won the contract to demonstrate a combat-strength 100-kilowatt laser to be mounted on Army trucks, specifically what the service calls its family of medium tactical vehicles. “This system is being designed to knock out rockets, artillery or mortar fire, or small drones,” Roy Azevedo, vice president of intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance systems with the Raytheon space and airborne systems business unit, said in a statement. NO IRAN WAIVERS FOR ALLIES? The United States will not hesitate to enforce sanctions on countries doing business with Iran despite deep concern among allies in Europe, the State Department said Monday. “We will not hesitate to take action when we see sanctionable activity and that is consistent with our policy of economic and diplomatic isolation of Iran,” said Brian Hook, the department’s director of policy planning. Waivers for the allies could undermine the Trump administration’s aim of curbing Tehran’s malign activities in the Middle East, Hook said. But he also hinted there might be some flexibility, saying that countries making an effort to reduce Iranian imports such as oil could be considered. CRIMEA NOT IN PLAY: The Kremlin says Russian President Vladimir Putin has no intention of discussing the status of Crimea, a region annexed from Ukraine in 2014, during his summit with Trump. “Crimea cannot and will never be on the agenda because Crimea is an integral part of Russia,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said yesterday. “We do not recognize Russia’s attempt to annex Crimea,” Sanders said at the White House yesterday. “We agree to disagree with Russia on that front, and our Crimea sanctions against Russia will remain in place until Russia returns the peninsula to the Ukraine.” TERROR LABEL: The Trump administration is considering designating Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a branch of Iran’s military, as a foreign terrorist organization, CNN reports. The move is controversial among senior Cabinet officials, as some caution it could jeopardize U.S. personnel and installations overseas. For example, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats warned that the new label could present challenges to U.S. forces. OPERATION ROUNDUP: The U.S. military says the operation to eradicate the remaining elements of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria is gaining momentum. In a release yesterday, Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve said the coalition and its partners have accelerated offensive activity against ISIS targets in both Iraq and Syria. “Since the May 1 start of Operation Roundup, Syrian Democratic Forces resumed major offensive operations in the Middle Euphrates River Valley,” the statement said. “Since then, the SDF has continued to gain ground through offensive operations coupled with precision Coalition strike support.” The coalition says ISIS morale is “sinking on the frontlines as privileged [ISIS] leaders increasingly abandon their own fighters on the battlefield, taking resources with them as they flee.” TAKING THE MEASURE OF MATTIS: Talk Radio News Pentagon correspondent Tom Squitieri spent some quality time with Mattis on his Asia trip last week, and had an interesting take on how Mattis approached the Chinese. “Mattis is a true soldier. He has fought and led others to victory. For all its strengths and paper prowess, the Chinese military is untested. It may train well yet that guarantees nothing,” Squitieri writes, observing it was Mattis’ legendary military career that was his “secret weapon” to get the Chinese to pay attention to what he said. “The Chinese also know all this about him. It is that war fighting experience, that battlefield success, that they value, that makes his words ones they were open to hearing. That permitted Mattis to press Chinese President Xi Jinping and other top leaders on China’s buildup of military bases on disputed islands in the South China Sea — even as Xi defiantly stated Beijing would not give up ‘an inch of sovereignty,’ according to Chinese media. Mattis did not blink. He pressed the issue of China’s broken promise not to militarize the islands in every meeting except that with the president. In the meeting with Xi, he played his straight flush of geography, history, experience, calmness, and steadfastness.” McMASTER’S NEXT ACT: Former national security adviser retired Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster has been named a visiting fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University, beginning Sept. 1. McMaster, who was fired by tweet in March by Trump, will also serve as a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business in management. “I am delighted to welcome H.R. McMaster back to the Stanford community,” said FSI Director Michael McFaul, in a statement. “In addition to his insights regarding national security strategy for the academic and policy worlds, we look forward to his contributions to the education and training of future foreign policy leaders from Stanford University.” THE RUNDOWN Bloomberg: Pentagon Hyped $1.2 Billion F-35 Savings Claim, Senators Say Defense News: US spy planes are breaking down ― and lawmakers want answers Stars and Stripes: Former Army Europe boss: Pulling US troops from Germany would be a big win for Russia Business Insider: Trump is trying to increase the pressure on Iran, but that means 'threading the needle' with a major ally Foreign Policy: The EU and NATO and Trump — Oh My!

News article:
President Donald Trump reportedly greeted German Chancellor Angela Merkel with a massive bill when she visited him soon after he entered the White House. Related: Watch: Angela Merkel looks unamused as Trump brags about saving money on Jerusalem embassy building "Angela, you owe me $1 trillion," Trump said, referring to the gulf between what Germany agreed to contribute to its defense under a NATO arrangement and what it actually spent over the previous 14 years, an official briefed on the meeting told The Wall Street Journal in a story published Sunday. Trump's brash remark to Merkel more than a year ago showcases his insistence that U.S. allies pay more for their defense—a stance he has maintained ahead of the NATO summit later this week. "The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country. This is not fair, nor is it acceptable," Trump tweeted Monday morning. "While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office, they must do much more. Germany is at 1%, the U.S. is at 4%." The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country. This is not fair, nor is it acceptable. While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office, they must do much more. Germany is at 1%, the U.S. is at 4%, and NATO benefits....... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2018 He continued by arguing that NATO benefits Europe "far more than it does the U.S." "By some accounts, the U.S. is paying for 90% of NATO, with many countries nowhere close to their 2% commitment," Trump tweeted. "On top of this the European Union has a Trade Surplus of $151 Million with the U.S., with big Trade Barriers on U.S. goods. NO!" Trump has complained about NATO since 2016 when he was on the campaign trail and said the U.S. could decline to meet its commitment to mutual defense because allies have not paid 2 percent of their gross domestic product, as agreed. Since his initial meeting with Merkel, the relationship between the two leaders has become only more tense. When Merkel visited the White House in April, Trump said, "Angela, you need to stop buying gas from Putin," referring to a Russia-Germany natural gas pipeline, according to an official at the meeting. Merkel responded that she wanted to broaden natural gas purchases and said she would try to convince members of the European Union to include this in trade talks. The divide between the two has often been painfully visible. The chancellor in April looked unamused during a joint press conference in which Trump boasted at length about how he had negotiated a lower price for the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. Germany is among several countries that urged the U.S. not to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. At the G-7 summit in Quebec last month, a photo went viral of Trump sitting with his arms crossed and smirking as Merkel stared him down. Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer said what happened next was Trump "stood up, he put his hand in his suit jacket pocket and he took two Starburst candies out, threw them on the table and said to Merkel, 'Here, Angela, don't say I never gave you anything.'"

© Francois Lenoir / Reuters European Council President Donald Tusk called on Donald Trump to be more respectful towards America's allies ahead of a NATO summit, arguing that they are now in short supply."Dear America, appreciate your allies, after all you don't have that many," Tusk said after signing a statement on cooperation between the EU and NATO.The declaration was signed ahead of a two-day meeting of NATO members in Brussels starting Wednesday, in which Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, will represent the European Union.Trump brushed aside Tusk's criticism as he was leaving the US for a trip to Europe, which will include a NATO summit, a visit to the UK and his first dedicated bilateral meeting with Russia's Vladimir Putin:The US leader has been repeatedly voicing his unease about NATO partners. He once branded the bloc a vehicle used by European allies to abuse America's generosity and gain military protection while failing to pull their weight financially. The rhetoric sparked fears in Europe that the US may announce the downgrading of its military presence on the continent during this week's meeting.The abrasive personal style and US-centered policies of the US president put long-established ties between America and its closest allies under strain. Critics say Trump undermined US global leadership less than half-way through his first term.Some European nations, including heavyweight Germany, have been targeted by the Trump administration for energy trade with Russia. Washington threatened European companies involved in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project with sanctions. In Germany the threat is perceived as an attempt to push the expensive liquefied natural gas produced by the US to the European market.Threats of sanctions are also used by the US to push Europeans away from Iran after Trump withdrew America from a key multilateral deal with Tehran over its nuclear program. Negotiated under Barack Obama, the 2015 deal offered Iran the lifting of economic sanctions and new business opportunities in Europe in exchange for placing significant restrictions and a transparency mechanism on its nuclear industry. The withdrawal came against vocal criticism from other participants of the agreement, including Russia, China and the EU.

A file picture shows children walking past damaged homes in the West Bank Bedouin camp of Khan al-Ahmar on April 7, 2016 after Israeli authorities demolished four houses they said were built without permission Israel's supreme court ruled Thursday in favour of demolishing a Palestinian Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank, despite a campaign by European governments to save it. Campaigners said the hearing had been the final appeal open to the village of Khan al-Ahmar, located close to several Israeli settlements east of Jerusalem. It was unclear when the demolition of the village home to around 180 residents would take place. In its ruling the court said it found "no reason to intervene in the decision of the minister of defence to implement the demolition orders issued against the illegal structures in Khan al-Ahmar." The residents would be relocated elsewhere, it added, in a move critics say amounts to forcible transfer. The court ruled that the village was built without the relevant building permits. Such permits are nearly impossible to obtain for Palestinians in Israeli-controlled areas of the West Bank. "This verdict takes away the absolute minimal protection the Bedouin communities received until recently from the court," Shlomo Lecker, the lawyer representing the village, said in a statement. "By any standard of international humanitarian law, the verdict is an approval by the Israeli court of a crime against humanity." The decision was likely to be met with anger by European governments, who had been fighting to save the village. Last week the head of the British consulate-general in Jerusalem visited the village and said in a video clip published online that the planned demolition was a "matter of great concern for the UK and indeed for the European Union." Earlier Thursday Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman announced 2,500 new settlement units in the West Bank. All settlements are considered illegal under international law.

A number of Israeli settlers yesterday seized a Palestinian house in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, local media reported. The spokesman of the Youth Against Settlements (YAS) movement, Mohammed Azghir, told Safa that the settlers took over a Palestinian house in the neighbourhood of Qaitun. "The house is currently occupied by the settlers and is being guarded by the occupation's military forces," Azghir added. He explained that the area has been besieged by the Israeli forces since 2001, noting that Palestinians have not been allowed to access it. In 2016, the UN Security Council overwhelmingly approved Resolution 2334 which considered Israeli settlements in the 1967 occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, as "illegal". Fourteen States voted in favour, while the United States abstained without using its power of veto. Read: Israel approves construction of 261 settlement units in Hebron

Israeli forces demolish a home in Kobar village, August 16, 2018. Photo credit: Bahaa Nasr for WAFA. Even if Palestinians fulfill the appeal requirements put in place by military order 1797, Israeli authorities maintain complete authority to proceed with demolition. Two Jerusalem legal aid organizations will petition the Israeli Supreme Court to overturn a new military order which makes it possible for Israeli forces to demolish Palestinian homes in Area C within 96 hours after delivering demolition orders. The petition follows a formal letter the Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Rights Center (JLAC) and the St. Yves Society sent to the Israeli defense ministry on June 4, 2018 in which they argue that the military order “blatantly violates…international law and contravenes existing local legislation.” The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Occupied Territories (COGAT) issued military order 1797 on April 17, 2018. COGAT, under the direct control of the Israeli defense ministry, runs civil affairs in the occupied West Bank. Order 1797 will go into effect on June 19, 2018. Under the order, COGAT excuses itself from informing Palestinian homeowners directly that their homes are slated for demolition. JLAC and St. Yves explain in a joint press release that Israeli authorities only require demolition orders be placed “next to” relevant structures 96 hours before Israeli forces arrive to execute demolitions. If a homeowner does catch wind of an impending demolition, he or she must present an approved master plan and building permit to appeal the demolition. Israel’s discriminatory housing policies in the West Bank ensure that this is an almost impossible requirement for the 300,000 Palestinians living in Area C, 60 percent of the West Bank, to fulfill. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), between 2010 and 2014, for example, Israel approved 1.5 percent of building applications in Area C. Israeli authorities, however, routinely approve of settlement master plans and even halt demolitions of settler outposts citing the existence of master plans, JLAC and St. Yves point out. Indeed, since 2017 Israeli officials have approved nearly 14,000 settlement units in the West Bank. In addition to having to produce an approved master building plan within four days, Palestinian residents of Area C attempting to forestall demolition must prove that construction on their home or home addition has been completed for six months or that the structure has been inhabited for thirty days. By requiring that Palestinians produce so many documents in such a short period of time, this military order “virtually strips the affected residents of the right to due process and the capacity to challenge the demolition orders through legal avenues, by requiring that objections to the demolition order be accompanied with a valid building permit,” JLAC and St. Yves wrote in their press release. Moreover, COGAT remains the sole arbiter of these appeals. Put differently, even if Palestinians fulfill the appeal requirements put in place by military order 1797, COGAT empowers itself to proceed with demolition anyway. St. Yves and JLAC emphasize that this new military order violates international law, including Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which defines forcible transfer of occupied populations as a crime against humanity. The order also violates Article 43 of the 1907 Hague Regulations, which requires that an occupying power respect the laws in the country that it occupies. In this case, that means the Jordanian Planning and Construction Law, which allows residents to retroactively legalize home constructions in the face of a demolition order stemming from illegal construction. One area that may be acutely impacted by this new military order is the E1 corridor, which sits between the Jerusalem municipality’s borders and the settlement of Ma’ale Adumim. For years, Israeli politicians have proposed incorporating this area, which is in Area C, into the Jerusalem municipality. Such developments are key to maintaining what Israel euphemistically calls a “demographic balance” in Jerusalem, i.e. restricting the Palestinian population to 30 percent of the city’s total population. Palestinian presence in Jerusalem today likely constitutes at least 40 percent of the city’s population. The Palestinian Authority condemned military order 1797 when it was first announced. “This illegal development would generate more crimes against Palestinian rights of access to a safe and stable living environment and would worsen the already dire conditions of 393,000 Palestinian citizens,” the government said in a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office.

Israeli authorities have recently resumed work on the park and have been seen digging up and marking graves, removing trees and fencing off areas to halt future burials. During the first weekend of June, several Palestinians were injured and arrested while protesting the desecration of the cemetery. Outside of Jerusalem proper, in the West Bank, authorities are also clearing the way for a new settlement over the village of al-Khana Ahmar, a village mostly inhabited by Bedouin refugees who were expelled from southern Israel in 1952. In 2009, an Italian aid organization constructed a school there, but Israel ordered it to be demolished one month after it opened. After that, residents in neighboring Israeli settlements petitioned the courts to demolish the community, which has been slated for destruction since February 2010. In 2015, authorities confiscated solar panels that provided the only source of electricity to the village. ​Israel plans to relocate them yet again, this time north to a village called An-Nuway'imah, allowing Jewish settlers to claim the strategically significant spot. Building an Israeli settlement there would allow the government to connect the urban Israeli settlement of Ma'ale Adumim to Jerusalem and to control the gateway between northern and southern parts of the West Bank. Abu Khamiss, a spokesman for the current Khan al-Ahmar villagers, told France 24 in 2014 that "the place where Israel wants us to ‘relocate' would be like a prison for us. We'd be surrounded by Israeli settlements, a checkpoint and military training camps." The demolition is expected to begin any day now. Already, Israeli authorities have been accused of poisoning locals' dogs under cover of night, robbing the villagers of the "faithful shepherds."

Israeli occupation forces scuffle with protesters during the eviction of 15 illegal Jewish settler families from the illegal outpost of Netiv Ha’avot in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Tuesday (Reuters photo) NETIV HA’AVOT, West Bank — Israeli occupation forces on Tuesday began evicting illegal Jewish settlers from 15 homes which Israel’s highest court ruled were built illegally on privately-owned Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank. Under a supreme court order, the 15 dwellings are to be demolished within the next few days. Hundreds of young pro-settlement hard-liners gathered on Tuesday in several of the homes slated for demolition. Some of the protesters climbed onto the roof of one dwelling and hoisted Israeli flags. A few scuffles ensued with police but for the most part, demonstrators offered passive resistance and were carried away by officers who grabbed hold of their arms and legs. Most countries consider all Israeli settlements built in the West Bank and other land captured in the 1967 war as illegal. There are now about 500,000 illegal Israeli settlers living among some 2.6 million Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank. The entire Netiv Ha’avot settlement was built without official Israeli authorisation, but the government has retroactively agreed to allow the rest of the community to stay once the 15 homes built on private Palestinian land come down. Palestinians dismissed the dismantling of a small number of homes as an empty gesture. Wassel Abu Youssef, a Palestine Liberation Organisation official said: “All settlement is illegal and must be removed. Israel is trying to fool world public opinion by removing some homes here and there while it continues to build settlements.” The Israeli government has announced a plan to pay compensation to the families whose homes are to be razed and rehouse them on adjacent tracts not owned by individual Palestinians. The remainder of Netiv Ha’avot, where some 20 houses stand on land not covered by the court ruling, is to be granted legal status and designated a neighbourhood of an Israeli government-recognised settlement, Elazar, the Cabinet decided in February. Israeli occupation authorities have carried out similar evictions in the past under court order. In February 2017, some 300 illegal settlers were removed from the unauthorised outpost of Amona in the West Bank. But settlement expansion, which has drawn Palestinian and international condemnation, has continued, with little objection from the administration of US President Donald Trump, in contrast to criticism voiced by his predecessor Barack Obama. Palestinians seek to establish a state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and say Israeli settlements are intended to deny them a viable and contiguous country. Israel’s refusal to halt settlement expansion was one of the reasons peace talks collapsed in 2014.

Israeli army forces reportedly ordered a Palestinian farmer in the Jordan Valley to evacuate his land on Tuesday, with forces saying they were going to raze the land. WAFA agency said, according to Ma’an, that Ahmad Assi Damra, from Hijlet al-Zour, east of Jericho, was ordered to evacuate his 25 dunam (six acre) plot of land, which is planted with palm trees, in order raze it. A similar order was reportedly made to another Palestinian farmer, Suleiman al-Zayed, who has planted his four dunam plot in the village of Nuweimeh, north of Jericho, with olive trees. The majority of the Jordan Valley is under full Israeli military control, despite being within the West Bank. Meanwhile, at least 44 percent of the total land in the Jordan Valley has been appropriated by Israeli forces, for military purposes and training exercises. Forming a third of the occupied West Bank and with 88 percent of its land classified as Area C, the Jordan Valley has long been a strategic area of land unlikely to return to Palestinians following Israel’s occupation in 1967.

The clashes started as hundreds of police officers arrived in Tapuah Maarav, a Jewish outpost in the northern West Bank, to evict 10 houses that were built without permits. The Supreme Court ruled that these houses were built illegally on privately-owned Palestinian land and should be evicted by the end of June. A police statement said that by noon, some 11 police officers were injured and six settlers were arrested for rioting. Under the international law, all Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, are illegal. However, Israel charges that the settlements, home to some 600,000 Israelis who live in heavily guarded communities among about 3 million Palestinians, are legal. Outposts like Tapuah Maarav are settlements built without official permits from the Israeli authorities and are also deemed illegal under the Israeli law.

Palestinian children at the Khan al-Ahmar school on 11 June. The school was built in 2009 out of rubber tires and mud in an attempt to evade Israel’s restriction on Palestinians using cement for construction, and has been under constant threats of demolition. Oren Ziv ActiveStills Israel’s destruction of the community of Khan al-Ahmar may be imminent, human rights defenders are warning. On Tuesday, the UN’s human rights office said it was concerned that residents of the community were “at high risk of forcible transfer” in coming days. Israeli forces arrived in the occupied West Bank village on Sunday, heightening fears among its almost 200 residents. Soldiers measured homes and road barriers and listed possessions, all of which is typically done prior to a demolition, according to Jahalin Solidarity, a group that advocates for the rights of the Jahalin Bedouin community. Israeli police told residents that they would be better off if they left “voluntarily,” according to Israeli human rights group B’Tselem. Preparations for a war crime: Israeli authorities arrived this morning at the Palestinian community of Khan al-Ahmar which Israel plans to forcibly transfer. A police officer told them they would be forcibly removed and that they would be better off if they left "voluntarily." pic.twitter.com/8bZlAF9x7v — B'Tselem בצלם بتسيلم (@btselem) July 1, 2018 LAST NIGHT: Activists joined local residents of of the Bedouin village of Khan al Ahmar to watch the World Cup and stay in solidarity with the village under imminent threat of demolition by Israel forces.

This land east of Jerusalem, the so-called E1 area, is where Israel plans to expand its mega-settlement of Maaleh Adumim, completing the isolation of the northern and southern parts of the West Bank from each other. In May, Israel’s high court approved the forced displacement of the community to make way for Israeli settlement expansion. Their village will be destroyed and residents will be forced to an area near the garbage dump of the Palestinian village of Abu Dis. Residents had devised an alternative plan for their community but it was rejected by Israel’s defense ministry. Forced displacement is a war crime under international law, human rights groups have affirmed. No option to challenge demolitions Khan al-Ahmar is located in Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank. Area C remains under complete Israeli military rule under the terms of the Oslo accords signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1990s. Israel has refused to permit nearly all Palestinian construction in Area C, forcing Palestinians to build without permits and to live in constant fear that their homes or communities will be demolished. Israel is escalating its moves to force Palestinians off their lands. On 17 June, it imposed a new military order removing “any option for Palestinians to challenge demolition orders that the civil administration issues for new structures, allowing Israel to demolish homes summarily,” according to B’Tselem. The civil administration is the name Israel gives to the military bureaucracy that rules Palestinians in the occupied West Bank by force. Under the new order, the military can order the demolition of any uncompleted building, or any structure that has been completed in the last six months. This includes unoccupied buildings as well as homes whose residents moved in within the last 30 days. The military may even order the demolition of a property that has a building permit. Palestinians have just four days to appeal, after which the army can proceed with the destruction and seizure of property. “The new military order removes the façade of judicial review over demolition orders and over Israel’s planning and building policy in the West Bank,” according to B’Tselem. Fast-tracking expulsions B’Tselem pointed out that this is not the first time Israel has stripped away the façade of legal proceedings to fast-track expulsions and demolitions. In 2017, Israel began bypassing its own legal formalities in order to expedite the expulsion of Palestinians from land targeted for Israeli colonization. Previously Israel issued demolition orders for individual buildings. The expedited procedures include wholesale demolition orders for entire communities.

Clashes broke out earlier in the day between police and protesters at the illegally built Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar, east of Jerusalem, which is due to be demolished. The J Street organization said in a statement it was “outraged by the Israeli government’s dispatch of bulldozers today.” “Prime Minister Netanyahu’s government seems intent on using the July 4th holiday as cover to move forward with demolition plans that have been opposed by dozens of US lawmakers, hundreds of rabbis and thousands of pro-Israel, pro-peace Americans,” the group said in a statement. “Netanyahu and his government should know: Even on July 4th, Americans are watching their destructive actions in the West Bank, with deep frustration and concern for the damage they are doing to the future of both Israelis and Palestinians,” J Street said, noting that on July 2 it delivered a letter with 7,000 signatures to the Israeli embassy in Washington opposing the demolition.

Eleven people were arrested, including an activist from the B’Tselem rights group. Three police officers were lightly injured in the confrontation, the force said, and some 35 protesters were hurt, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. After a years-long legal battle, the Supreme Court approved the demolition in May. The state says the structures were built without the relevant building permits and pose a threat to residents because of their proximity to a highway. Advertisement The hamlet has been the subject of international controversy over the years for, among other things, its elementary school, which is made of tires, mud and falafel oil. Critics say building permits are nearly impossible to obtain for Palestinians in Israeli-controlled areas of the West Bank and the demolition is meant to clear the way for new Jewish settlements. Israel says it has offered the residents an alternative location, near a garbage dump belonging to the Palestinian town of Abu Dis. Bedouin villagers say the location is unsuitable for their way of life, and have asserted that residents of Abu Dis have warned them not to come there. According to the UN, the village has 180 residents.

News article:
Scuffles broke out Wednesday between Israeli authorities and protesters who fear preparations are under way to raze a Bedouin village in a strategic part of the occupied West Bank, despite international calls for a reprieve. Protesters, including some waving Palestinian flags, tried to block a bulldozer and tussled with police at Khan Al-Ahmar, east of Jerusalem. Some climbed onto the bulldozer in protest. Israeli police said 11 people were arrested. Israeli rights group B’Tselem said they included the organisation’s own head of field research. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported 35 people were injured, with four taken to hospital. Police said the injured included three officers, including one taken to hospital. Police said stones were thrown at officers. The confrontation came after activists said the Israeli military had issued a warrant to the 173 residents of Khan A-Ahmar on Tuesday, authorising soldiers to seize access roads to the village. Heavy equipment was seen around the village on Wednesday, prompting speculation a road was being prepared to facilitate its evacuation and demolition. “Today they are proceeding with infrastructure work to facilitate the demolition and forcible transfer of residents,” Amit Gilutz, spokesman for B’Tselem, told AFP. Israeli authorities say the village and its school were built illegally. In May, the supreme court rejected a final appeal against its demolition. But activists say the villagers had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, because the documents are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank where Israel has full control over civilian affairs. Israel authorities say they have offered villagers an alternative site. The village is made up mainly of makeshift structures of tin and wood, which is traditionally the case with Bedouin villages. It is unclear when the demolition will take place. Senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat condemned the demolition plans and appealed to the international community. “Are we coming to see one day that Israel can be held accountable?” he asked journalists in Ramallah. “If not, it means you’re pushing this region towards a deeper hole of violence and counter-violence and extremes.” Nickolay Mladenov, UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, condemned Israel’s demolition preparations. “Such actions are contrary to international law and undermine the two-state solution,” he said in a statement. Britain’s minister of state for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, visited the village in May and called on the Israeli government to show restraint. Burt said any forced relocation “could constitute forcible transfer of people, as far as the United Nations is concerned”. Forcible transfer is considered a violation of the Geneva Conventions. Khan Al-Ahmar is east of Jerusalem, near several major Israeli settlement blocs and close to a highway leading to the Dead Sea. Activists are concerned that continued Israeli settlement construction in the area could effectively divide the West Bank in two. In another Bedouin village in the same region, Abu Nuwar, Israel carried out a series of demolitions on Wednesday on what it described as illegally built structures. B’Tselem said nine residential structures and three agricultural ones were demolished, leaving 62 people homeless. The Israeli defence ministry’s COGAT unit for civilian affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories said the demolitions had taken place after the “owners of the buildings failed to utilise the planning procedures to their fullest extent”. “This despite the fact that they were given the opportunity to enquire in the matter and were told that if they did not, the illegal construction would be demolished,” it said in a statement.

News article:
The High Court of Justice on Thursday night issued a temporary injunction preventing the state from carrying out plans to demolish a West Bank Bedouin village. Following an urgent petition submitted by Alaa Mahajna on behalf of the Bedouin community of Khan al-Ahmar, the court froze the demolition of the village, giving the state until July 11 to respond. The petition says the Civil Administration, in charge of construction permits in the West Bank, never offered any plans to legalize the village, and refused to review a plan submitted by the villagers. After a years-long legal battle, the Supreme Court approved the demolition of Khan al-Ahmar in May. The state says the structures were built without the relevant building permits and pose a threat to the village residents because of their proximity to a highway. But activists say the villagers — who have lived at the site since the 1950s after the state evicted them from their Negev homes — had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, as these are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank, such as Khan al-Ahmar, where Israel has full control over civilian affairs.

And on Thursday European diplomats tried to pay a solidarity visit to the village, but police barred them from reaching a school there. Diplomats from Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Switzerland sought to visit the school which is funded by several European countries, but they were turned back at the village entrance. Advertisement Police at the scene said the area had been declared a closed military zone. “We were briefed by local leaders but refused access by security forces to the school,” the Irish representative office to the West Bank wrote on its official Twitter feed. “We wanted to show our solidarity with this village which is threatened with destruction, for humanitarian reasons and because it is a major issue of international law,” the Consul General of France in Jerusalem, Pierre Cochard, told journalists at the scene. He said that demolishing the village would be a violation of the Geneva convention, laying out the obligations of an occupier toward those under its control. It would also significantly complicate the search for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he added. Opponents of the demolition say it is part of an effort to to enable the expansion of the nearby settlement of Kfar Adumim, and to create a region of contiguous Israeli control from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea.

News article:
The UN Human Rights Office and many European countries have slammed Israel’s decision to demolish a small Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank. Activists claim Israel wants to use the land to expand settlements. Israeli authorities have moved three bulldozers to Khan al-Ahmar, a Bedouin herding village in the West Bank, following a court’s ruling that declared the settlement illegal under Israeli law. The military already left a land confiscation notice there on Tuesday, local media reported. The Supreme Court approved the demolition in May. The village had been built without an Israeli permit, but Palestinians say they are impossible to obtain. Protests erupted at the village on Wednesday, descending into clashes with Israeli police. Two people were arrested and over 30 were injured, according to a Palestinian ambulance service. Meanwhile, high-ranked EU and international officials began pounding Israel with condemnation of the looming demolition. Liz Throssell, a spokesperson for the UN human rights office, said that “international humanitarian law prohibits the destruction or confiscation of private property by the occupying power.” Maja Kocijancic, the EU spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy, lamented the West Bank demolitions, saying they “exacerbate threats to the viability of the two-state solution and further undermine prospects for a lasting peace.” The French Foreign Ministry asserted that bulldozing Khan al-Akhram, which is located in an area “essential for the continuity of a future Palestinian state,” goes against international humanitarian law. Its statement has also accused Israel of undermining peace prospects for Palestine. Jamie McGoldrick, the UN Development and Humanitarian Coordinator in Palestine, had also called upon Tel Aviv to reverse the demolition. “Like many Palestinians in Area C, the residents of Khan al Ahmar have fought for years to live with dignity, to protect their children, their homes, and their community,” he said, urging support for people who “have struggled in the face of tremendous daily pressure.” In light of today's worrying developments in Khan al Ahmar and Abu Nuwar, I reiterate my https://t.co/QNit6u4uVf abandon plans to demolish and transfer #Palestinian communities pic.twitter.com/Q7jtQLWHch — Jamie McGoldrick (@jamiemcgoldric8) July 4, 2018 Sarit Michaeli, an international advocacy officer with B'Tselem, uploaded images of Khan al-Ahmar bracing for the demolition. “This is what a war crime looks like,” she tweeted. Residents of #khanAlAhmar observe helplessly as the Israeli authorities prepare a road to facilitate the demolition of their home, right now. This is what a war crime looks like. pic.twitter.com/FrvPusElzX — Sarit Michaeli (@saritm0) July 4, 2018 Rights groups say that without the Bedouin village, there will be a bigger settlement pocket near Jerusalem. While Khan al-Ahmar is a small, impoverished settlement of some 180 people – the only school there was literally built from discarded tires – its significance is strategic. Israel is planning to construct a belt of Jewish settlements around Jerusalem in so-called Area C, the major part of West Bank which it completely controls and administers, and Khan al-Ahmar is a likely building site.

Israeli police scuffled with activists protesting the planned demolition of a Bedouin hamlet in the West Bank on Wednesday amid international opposition to the razing of the site. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said 11 people were arrested in the “disturbance” including several for throwing stones at officers in Khan al-Ahmar. He said three officers were injured, including one evacuated to a hospital for treatment. Advertisement Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian legislator, said four protesters were injured. “This is a vicious, barbaric attack on peaceful demonstrators and they are trying to demolish Khan Al-Ahmar,” he said. Israel says the structures that make up the Khan al-Ahmar encampment of corrugated shacks and tents were illegally built and pose a threat to residents because of their proximity to a highway. Police could be seen dragging a handcuffed woman and pushing a Bedouin man. A construction vehicle flattened earth near the site. The Bedouin village outside the Kfar Adumim settlement, is set to be demolished at an unknown date after Israel's Supreme Court approved the move in May. Residents and activists voiced concern on Wednesday that Israel is set to raze the Bedouin village in a strategic part of the occupied West Bank ignoring international calls for a reprieve. Activists said the Israeli military issued a warrant to the 173 residents of Khan al-Ahmar on Tuesday authorizing it to seize access roads to the village. Heavy equipment, including at least one bulldozer, was seen around the village on Wednesday, leading to speculation a road was being prepared to facilitate its evacuation and demolition. “Today they are proceeding with infrastructure work to facilitate the demolition and forcible transfer of residents,” Amit Gilutz, spokesperson for Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, told AFP. Israeli authorities say the village and its school were built illegally and in May, the supreme court rejected a final appeal against its demolition. But activists say the villagers had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits as the documents are near impossible for Palestinians to obtain for that part of the occupied West Bank. Israel authorities say they have offered villagers a relocation site. They did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Britain’s minister of state for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, visited the village in May and called on the Israeli government to show restraint. He warned that any forced relocation “could constitute forcible transfer of people as far as the United Nations is concerned.” Forcible transfer is considered a violation of the Geneva Conventions. Khan al-Ahmar is located east of Jerusalem near several Israeli settlements along a road leading to the Dead Sea. Activists are concerned that continued Israeli settlement construction in the area could effectively divide the West Bank in two.

Jerusalem, 5 July 2018 Today, the Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. Jamie McGoldrick, the Head of West Bank Operations for UNRWA, Mr. Scott Anderson, and the Head of the UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. James Heenan, expressed serious concern over demolitions and related events in vulnerable Palestinian communities in the central West Bank Yesterday, Israeli forces began levelling access routes in the Palestinian Bedouin community of Khan al Ahmar-Abu al Helu, home to more than 180 people, 95 per cent of whom are Palestine refugees. The work comes in advance of the expected demolition of the entire community. Israeli forces injured thirty-five Palestinians and arrested others, including residents, in confrontations that ensued while bulldozers were levelling all entry and exit points. One Israeli soldier was also reported injured as well. Today, the Israeli authorities have declared Khan al Ahmar a closed military area, and are heavily restricting movement of residents and preventing the entry of others to the community. “What we are seeing unfold on the ground is deeply disturbing,” said Mr. McGoldrick. “Demolitions have a devastating impact on families and on communities. These demolitions are particularly outrageous because they target communities who already live in extremely difficult conditions, with high levels of humanitarian needs. I call again on the Israeli authorities to cease demolitions and other measures that may result in the forcible transfer of Palestinians.” This situation occurs on the backdrop of a wave of demolitions across the West Bank in recent days. Since 1 July, eleven incidents have occurred, displacing 59 Palestinians, including 37 children, and affecting more than 200 others. Included within this is the demolition of 19 structures, including nine homes, in the Palestinian Bedouin community of Abu Nuwar (around 600 residents, 88 per cent Palestine refugees). As a result, 51 people, including 33 children, were displaced and another 13 people, including five children, who had family property destroyed, were directly affected. Also, one home was destroyed today in Susiya, displacing a family of five. “The escalation of events in the last few days – the demolitions in Abu Nuwar, the declaration of the Khan al Ahmar community as a closed military zone, the violence and large presence of armed Israeli forces – makes life in these communities virtually untenable. The latest developments are of serious concern as it is evident that they are undertaken with the objective of relocating the concerned communities, as well as causing serious distress to the vulnerable residents who are watching what appear to be preparations for the demolition of their community,” said Mr. Scott Anderson. “These pastoral communities are mostly Palestine refugees – originally displaced from their tribal lands in the Negev. They should not be forced to experience a second displacement against their will.” “The demolitions in the community will have serious human rights and humanitarian law consequences,” said Mr. Heenan. “There is high risk of forced evictions of individuals, destruction of private property as well as a dramatic increase in the coercive environment under which the community already lives, in turn raising the risk of forcible transfer.” END For more information, please contact Mr. Ofir Feuerstein, +972 (0) 54 33 11 836, feuerstein@un.org (mailto:feuerstein@un.org) Background: Khan al Ahmar – Abu al Helu and Abu Nuwar are among the 46 Palestinian Bedouin communities (8,100 people) at risk of forcible transfer in the central West Bank and among the more than 3,500 residents living in 18 communities located in the area slated for the E1 settlement plan that seeks to connect the Ma’ale Adummim settlement bloc with East Jerusalem. International humanitarian law (IHL) requires an occupying power to protect the population of the territory that it occupies, ensure its welfare and wellbeing, as well as the respect for its human rights. Any destruction of property by the occupying power is prohibited, except when rendered absolutely necessary by military operations, which is not relevant in the West Bank where there are currently no active hostilities. The extensive demolition of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly, may be a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and may amount to a war crime. Other than for the security of the population or imperative military reasons, IHL further prohibits the transfer of the population of an occupied territory without the genuinely and fully informed consent of the affected people, regardless of the motive. Consent is not considered genuine in an environment marked by the use or threat of physical force, coercion, fear of violence or duress. In the absence of such consent, the transfer is forcible and constitutes a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention.

Israel's top court today suspended the planned demolition of a Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank whose fate has become a focus of Palestinian protests and international concern, a lawyer for the residents said, Reuters reports. The Supreme Court injunction, issued a day after Israeli security forces violently attacked protesters in Khan Al-Ahmar, gave the state until 11 July to respond to the villagers' contention that they had been unfairly denied building permits, lawyer Alaa Mahajna told Reuters. The court spokesman could not be reached for comment. Around 180 Bedouin, raising sheep and goats, live in tin and wood shacks in Khan Al-Ahmar. Demolition of Khan Al-Ahmar: Another chapter in the ethnic cleansing of Palestine Last year Israeli authorities informed the High Court that they plan to seize the land where the community is located and displace its residents, although the land is registered as owned by Palestinian citizens from the nearby town of Anata. The land is set to be used to expand nearby illegal Jewish only settlements. The residents of Khan Al-Ahmar, known as Al-Jahhalin Bedouins, are refugees from the Negev desert who have lived in the area south of Jerusalem since their displacement by the Israeli army in 1967. Israel has refused to recognise Al-Jahhalin Bedouin communities or grant them building permits.

Israel has long sought to clear Bedouin from the area between the two settlements, and the Supreme Court approved the demolition in May. Israel police violently attack and evict Palestinians near Jerusalem Removing the Bedouin, human rights groups say, would create a bigger settlement pocket near Jerusalem and make it more difficult for Palestinians to achieve territorial contiguity in the West Bank, a territory they seek along with the Gaza Strip for a future state. Israel said it plans to relocate the residents to an area about 12 kilometres (seven miles) away, near the Palestinian village of Abu Dis. The new site is adjacent to a landfill and rights advocates say that a forcible transfer of the residents would violate international law applying to occupied territory. The United Nations and European Union have come out against the plan. Why is Israel ignoring the West Bank protests to lift Gaza sanctions? Most countries regard settlements Israel has built in the West Bank as illegal. Israel disputes this. Khan al-Ahmar's residents belong to the Jahalin tribe of Bedouin who were expelled from southern Israel by the military in the 1950s. Interviewed before the Supreme Court injunction on Thursday, Israeli Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan signalled that the Khan al-Ahmar demolition might not be imminent. Noting the level of international opposition to the move, Erdan told the Ynet news site: "I hope this decision will be implemented in the coming weeks."

News article:
Senior United Nations officials on the ground in the occupied Palestinian territory yesterday urged Israel to halt its demolition of Palestinian properties, expressing "serious concern" over events in Khan Al-Ahmar, a village slated for destruction. Humanitarian Coordinator, Jamie McGoldrick, the Head of West Bank Operations for UNRWA, Scott Anderson, and the Head of the UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights, James Heenan, spoke out as Israeli forces began preparations this week for the planned demolition of Khan Al-Ahmar and the expulsion of its residents. The Israeli Supreme Court – which has previously approved the demolition – yesterday issued a temporary injunction. McGoldrick said: What we are seeing unfold on the ground is deeply disturbing. Demolitions have a devastating impact on families and on communities. He added: "These demolitions are particularly outrageous because they target communities who already live in extremely difficult conditions, with high levels of humanitarian needs. I call again on the Israeli authorities to cease demolitions and other measures that may result in the forcible transfer of Palestinians." Demolition of Khan Al-Ahmar: Another chapter in the ethnic cleansing of Palestine The UN press release noted that "a wave of demolitions across the West Bank in recent days", with 59 Palestinians displaced since 1 July, including 37 children. "The escalation of events in the last few days – the demolitions in Abu Nuwar, the declaration of the Khan Al-Ahmar community as a closed military zone, the violence and large presence of armed Israeli forces – makes life in these communities virtually untenable," said Anderson. "The latest developments are of serious concern as it is evident that they are undertaken with the objective of relocating the concerned communities, as well as causing serious distress to the vulnerable residents who are watching what appear to be preparations for the demolition of their community." 17 Palestinians homeless as Israel demolishes their flats He added: "These pastoral communities are mostly Palestine refugees – originally displaced from their tribal lands in the Negev. They should not be forced to experience a second displacement against their will." "The demolitions in the community will have serious human rights and humanitarian law consequences," said Heenan. "There is high risk of forced evictions of individuals, destruction of private property as well as a dramatic increase in the coercive environment under which the community already lives, in turn raising the risk of forcible transfer."

© AFP © AFP Israel faces mounting international condemnation as its security forces prepare to demolish Palestinian villageIsrael has faced mounting international condemnation as its security forces continued preparations to demolish the town.The High Court had upheld the demolition order against the town of 180 residents in May."The school and community of al Khan al-Ahmar have received a last minute reprieve for possibly a few days." she said. "The community is terrified that the bulldozers will be back."This community has already suffered so much and the impending threat of demolition is having a huge impact on the psychological wellbeing of the children," she added, noting that Khan al-Ahmar is home to school that serves some 170 Palestinian children living in Bedouin communities in the area.However, Human Rights Watch notes that "the Israeli military refuses to permit most new Palestinian construction in the 60 percent of the West Bank where it has exclusive control over planning and building, even as the military facilitates settler construction".Walid Assaf, head of the National Committee to Resist the Wall and Settlements, credited activists on the ground for the injunction. He also thanked foreign diplomats and lawyers who worked on the case and visited the community regularly in support.Assaf was quoted as saying by official Palestinian news agency Wafa.In a statement published by the PLO's Negotiations Affairs Department on Thursday, Khan al-Ahmar residents had called on the international community to "hold Israel accountable for its crimes"."The issue of Khan al-Ahmar illustrates Israel's objective of widespread and systematic forcible displacement of Palestinians and replacement with Israeli settlers, as part and parcel of Israel's broader scheme of creeping annexation," the statement said.On Thursday, prior to the court's decision, the United Nations warned that displacing Palestinian villagers has "serious human rights and humanitarian law consequences"."These pastoral communities are mostly Palestine refugees - originally displaced from their tribal lands in the Negev. They should not be forced to experience a second displacement against their will.""We wanted to show our solidarity to this village which is threatened with destruction, for reasons both humanitarian (...) and because it is a major issue of international law," said the consul general of France in Jerusalem, Pierre Cochard.he added."This decision complicates a little more and significantly the search for peace and a peace based on two states" - one Israeli, one Palestinian, he added.Yusuf Abu Dawoud, a 37-year-old resident of Khan al-Ahmar, told Middle East Eye on Wednesday that Israeli forces and bulldozers were beginning to attack the village "without any humanity".

Israel demolished two houses belonging to Arabs in the city of Qalansawa and are to demolish 50 more under the pretext that they were built without the necessary planning consents, Safa News Agency reported. During a meeting held by the High Follow Up Committee for Arab Citizens of in Israel, engineer Nadi Al-Taya said two houses belonging to the Warda family had been levelled and the demolition of 50 more was underway. He said Israel delays or rejects building licenses submitted by Arab citizens forcing them to build without permission. Al-Taya said that Israel does this in order to the Arab population while encouraging Jewish expansionism. Head of the Follow Up Committee Mohamed Baraka said: "The crime which took place this morning [demolition of the two houses] is an extension of the crimes of the Israeli authorities in Umm Al-Fahm, Ar'ara and Jajoulia." Report: Israel demolished, sealed 48 homes of resistance fighters He added: "We must bring all our efforts together to face these challenges… We have no weapons and we cannot win the legal battles as the law was laid down to facilitate uprooting the Arab citizens." Meanwhile, Head of the Municipality of Qalansawa Abdel-Baset Salama said: "We were in contact with specialists in the issue of planning and construction regarding the two houses, but the racist [Israeli] courts turned down all out proposals to iron out the issue." He added: "The two houses were part of the city's plan and we had documents for this. We started the procedures to get the licenses, but we were surprised with demolition orders."

On April 13, a new era of combat commenced as part of the ongoing conflict between Israel and residents of the Gaza Strip'. Several incendiary kites flown into Israel, under the auspices of the violent riots on the Gaza border fence, caused a fire in the kibbutz of Nahal Oz. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Since then, the "aerial terror offensive" against the Gaza border communities has continued with greater vigor, including some 300 incendiary kites flown into Israel's territory, 100 fires and more than 3,000 acres of wheat destroyed, causing millions of shekels worth of damage to the farmers of the area. Incendiary kites destroying wheat fields The Eshkol and Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Councils' communities and farmlands under attack include Kissufim and Be'eri forests, Kibbutzim Nir Oz, Kerem Shalom, Sufa, Kfar Aza, Sa'ad, Mefalsim, Erez, and Gevim. Incendiary kites cause fires across Gaza border communities X The Eshkol and Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Councils' communities and farmlands under attack include Kissufim and Be'eri forests, Kibbutzim Nir Oz, Kerem Shalom, Sufa, Kfar Aza, Sa'ad, Mefalsim, Erez, and Gevim. The modus operandi has been the same in all the incidents causing fires: During the Gaza border riots, terrorists attached Molotov cocktails and other incendiary objects to kites and flew them into Israel. Terror kites being assembled in Gaza (Photo: AFP) Hundreds of drones were developed and purchased within several days by the IDF to aid intercept the incendiary kites. Incendiary kite cause fire in Be'eri forest The Defense Ministry's Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure (Maf'at) managed to provide within several days new operational solutions assembled on existing drones and on those which are being currently developed by the "Aeronautics" security industry, such as the "Pegasus 120." "Pegasus 120" can carry up to 75 Kg, and was tested for the purpose of carrying cargo supplies, ammunition and fuel to forces maneuvering deep inside the enemy's territory as part of the Northern Command's military exercise last year. Drone meant to intercept incendiary kites Nevertheless, it seems the incendiary kites phenomenon is growing stronger. Last Wednesday, several kites flown into Israel caused serious fires across the Gaza border communities. Drone intercepting incendiary kites X The Gaza border communities' farmers are dealing on a daily basis with putting out fires instead of taking care of their harvest. Recently, they decided to hold the harvest earlier than planned so the wheat wouldn't be destroyed by fires caused by the kites. "We are frustrated with the situation, it has become real terror. We are coping with this phenomenon on a daily basis," one of the farmers said. "When a fire breaks out, we don't wait for the firefighting forces and use our own equipment (to put out the fire) otherwise the wheat would be completely destroyed and entire fields would disappear," he explained. "The right thing is to collaborate with the firefighting forces, but without our efforts the damage would have been much more severe," he added. Kites terror causes entire wheat field to be destroyed (Photo: AFP) Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon visited the western Negev communities two weeks ago and said, "Those who fly incendiary kites must be treated with the same severity as those who launch rockets into Israel." Kahlon was accompanied by a property tax representative during his visit and promised that farmers would be compensated for the damages caused to their wheat fields. In addition, the region authorities' heads have sent messages demanding the government to compensate them for their damaged "down to last shekel." They have also asked for the matter to be among IDF's top priorities. The fight against the relatively new threat consists of both offensive and defensive actions by the IDF including aerial attack of Hamas's posts as retaliation to launching incendiary kites into Israel. The IDF's Spokesperson's Unit said after one of the retaliatory attacks, "The IDF will continue to fight against terror above and below the ground. "The IDF considers the Hamas terror organization as solely responsible for what is happening in Gaza and outside of it," the statement added.

Firefighters were working to put out three large fires along the Gaza Strip border, believed to have been started by incendiary kites flown from the coastal enclave on Saturday. The largest fire was near to Kibbutz Carmia, adjacent to the northern Gaza Strip. Preliminary estimates suggested that between 2,000 to 3,000 dunam (500 to 740 acres) of fields and parts of a nature reserve adjacent to the kibbutz were destroyed. Officials at the Israel Nature and Parks Authority estimated that at least one third of the Carmia reserve had been destroyed. Residents were working alongside with firefighters to try to contain the fires that have become almost daily occurrences since the start of the “March of Return” protests along the border at the end of March. During the protests, Gazans have been flying kites into Israel outfitted with Molotov cocktails and containers of burning fuel, setting fire to large swaths of land.

Residents were working alongside with firefighters to try to contain the fires that have become almost daily occurrences since the start of the “March of Return” protests along the border at the end of March. During the protests, Gazans have been flying kites into Israel outfitted with Molotov cocktails and containers of burning fuel, setting fire to large swaths of land.

Firefighters were also working to gain control of a blaze near Kibbutz Be’eri, which borders the central Gaza Strip. Earlier Saturday, an additional fire had broke out in fields belonging to Kibbutz Nir Am also along the northern Gaza Strip.

Local residents told Israel Radio they were concerned that they would not be provided compensation for the damage, as the burden for proving they were victims of a terror attack fell on them. Zionist Union MK Eitan Brosh told the radio that lawmakers from his party would tour the area Sunday and work to provide the residents with solutions to their ongoing distress. The violent demonstrations were meant to end on May 15, but Hamas leaders have said they want them to continue.

News article:
Jerusalem – Teams of firefighters worked throughout the day on Sunday putting out large brush fires in fields belonging to communities in southern Israel, after they had been hit by flaming-kites launched from the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. Hundreds of acres of land was burnt near the communities of Nir Am, Or Haner and Be’eri after one such kite triggered a fire in the Sha’ar Hanegev Regional Council’s Simhoni Forest. The fire caused the southbound lane of Route 34 to be closed to traffic, and Israel Railways shut down the Ashkelon-Netivot route, stopping trains coming from the north at Ashkelon railway station and trains coming from the south at the Netivot station. The fires came a day after some 500 to 750 acres of a nature reserve next to Kibbutz Carmiya were destroyed by kites. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he instructed National Security Adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat to push forward a process that will subtract the amount of money the government must pay to Gaza-area communities for the damages caused by the fires, from the Palestinian tax money Israel transfers each month to the Palestinian Authority. According to Hebrew media, Israel Nature and Parks estimates that at least one-third of the reserve was destroyed on Saturday, despite four air tankers and 12 firefighting teams working to put out the flames. Gazans have been protesting along the border since March 30 as part of the Great March of Return, with demonstrators throwing stones and Molotov cocktails towards troops and launching incendiary kites and balloons towards Israeli territory. Late Saturday night, the Israel Air Force attacked 15 Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip following mortar fire against southern Israeli communities on Saturday evening. The military said the strikes were a response to the earlier rocket fire as well as “terror incidents led and made possible by the Hamas terror organization over the course of the weekend,” which included the throwing of grenades, improvised explosive devices, attempts to infiltrate into Israel by damaging the security fence and the burning of Israeli fields by incendiary kites. The mortar fire was the first violation of a fragile cease-fire and two days of relative quiet in southern Israel after the most significant escalation between the IDF and the terrorist groups in the coastal enclave in four years. The first round of sirens was activated Saturday in several nearby communities in the Eshkol Regional Council at around 8 p.m., with one mortar falling in open territory and the other intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system. Additional sirens sounded several times in the same communities, as well as in communities within the Sha’ar Hanegev and Hof Asheklon regions and in the city of Sderot, following additional rocket fire from the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. According to the military, the IAF bombed targets across the entire Gaza Strip in three Hamas compounds, including two weapon-production and storage sites, as well as targets belonging to Hamas’s naval force. If Hamas “chooses to follow a path of terrorism and not solve the difficulties of the people of Gaza, it will continue to pay a heavy price that will only become steeper as much as needed,” read the statement released by the IDF. The Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that residential homes were damaged when Israeli jets targeted one site in the al-Waha area northwest of Gaza City with three missiles. The Hamas-affiliated Shehab news agency reported that Israeli jets struck targets in Gaza City’s Shejaia neighborhood as well as in the Nuseirat refugee camp near Deir al-Bireh. Another target was struck outside the southern Gazan city of Rafah. Earlier in the evening, Israeli jets bombed locations in the al-Zaytoun neighborhood of Gaza City as well as targets in Khan Yunis and Rafah. Meanwhile, the IDF announced Sunday morning that a large scale exercise across the southern part of the country would begin despite the heightened tensions in the area. Residents of southern Israel should expect to see an increased presence of troops as well as military equipment and aircraft in the skies over southern Israel. The drill, which will last throughout Wednesday, was planned in advance “to preserve the fitness and preparedness of the troops,” the military said. The Israel Air Force will also be holding a separate drill throughout the country that is set to last until Thursday.

Firefighters were dispatched Tuesday morning to the Gaza border area after flaming kites were sent soaring over the border, causing at least three fires in Israeli territory, ahead of expected violent demonstrations along the Strip’s security fence. Two large fires broke out near Kibbutz Nir Am, northeast of the Gaza Strip, while the third was reported in the area of Moshav Netiv Ha’asara, to the north. Since the “March of Return” protests began along the Gaza border at the end of March, hundreds of kites and helium balloons have been flown into Israel outfitted with Molotov cocktails and containers of burning fuel, setting fire to large swaths of land. A large blaze was reported south of Nir Am, across the street from the nearby town of Sderot’s Sapir College. Footage from the scene, filmed by a student, showed the fire spreading rapidly as firetrucks were heard rushing to the scene. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The fire forced authorities to temporarily close down the Route 232 highway in southern Israel until the flames could be brought under control, according to a spokesperson for the local Sha’ar Hanegev regional council. The road later reopened. The second fire outside Nir Am broke out in nearby grazing lands, according to the Sha’ar Hanegev spokesperson. The military anticipated that large protests would take place on Tuesday along the security fence to commemorate what Palestinians refer to as the Naksa, or setback, of Israel’s victory in the 1967 Six Day War, which brought East Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights under Israeli control. Advertisement Firefighters, soldiers and local residents have worked on an almost daily basis to try to contain fires in Israeli fields ignited by the burning kites. On Sunday, the heads of the local governments in the Gaza periphery sent a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and Interior Minister Arye Deri calling for increased investment in the area in light of the precarious security situation. “In the past week, including last night, almost 200 mortar shells and Qassam rockets have landed in Gaza periphery communities, serving as a painful reminder that the Gaza periphery must manage a fragile and complicated way of life, under constant threat to its residents,” the local mayors wrote. Israeli officials have said that since the start of the protests at the Gaza border, there have been more than 200 fires in the Gaza periphery, destroying some 17,500 dunams (4,300 acres) of land, the majority of it in nature reserves and parks. According to the Nature and Parks Authority, approximately 10,000 dunams in parks and reserves in southern Israel were burned, though a spokesperson for the authority said investigations were still underway to determine exactly how much of that was caused by incendiary kites and balloons, and how much was from other sources. On Saturday, a blaze devastated the Carmia nature reserve in southern Israel Israel, in what officials said was the worst day of fires since the demonstrators adopted the fire kite tactics a few months ago. Advertisement Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan said Tuesday that Israel should initiate a program of targeted assassinations against those who fly burning kites from Gaza to Israel, as well as Hamas commanders. “The fact that Hamas is the one enabling the shooting and the sending of the kites means we must return to targeted assassinations, and the kite-launchers and Hamas commanders should be targeted for killing,” said Erdan during a visit to the southern Israeli town of Sderot. On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered that funds be withheld from the Palestinian Authority to compensate Israeli farmers living on the Gaza border who had their agricultural lands destroyed. Israel’s Tax Authority said the agricultural damage alone stood at NIS 5 million ($1.4 million) and that damage caused to nature reserves and other land could drive up the figure. President Reuven Rivlin called PA President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday and asked him to condemn the airborne arson attacks on the Gaza border and attempts to cross into Israel. “The terror coming from Gaza is a problem for both sides and we should hear your voice on this matter,” Rivlin said, according to Hebrew media reports. “We have to see how to stop the arson and infiltration of the border fence.”

"The IDF views the use of explosive balloons and incendiary kites gravely and will act to prevent use of them," the army said.

The residents, in conjunction with the Keren Kayemet LeYisrael (KKL), planted dozens of trees in the kibbutz. (Photo: Avi Rokach) "The kites phenomenon completely destroyed a lot of forests and groves in our area, and we decided, as a community activity, to give back to nature what has been taken from it," said Ofir Libenstein, a member of Kibbutz Kfar Aza who is leading the initiative. (Photo: Avi Rokach) "Beyond the financial damage, there's also damage to the Gaza border residents' morale, and we have decided to come together as a community and change this reality. The residents are coming together—families and children—to plant the trees," he continued. "This is the first of the activities, and in the coming days we will continue planting trees. We're motivated by the slogan: 'They're burning, and we're planting.'" (Photo: Avi Rokach) The residents were also joined by soldiers from the Gaza Division's Northern Brigade, led by their commander, Col. Avi Rosenfeld. "We need to provide a response, and we will provide a response. We will continue defending the Gaza border communities. We won't grow tire and won't lose sight of our values," Col. Rosenfeld vowed.

The residents are coming together—families and children—to plant the trees," he continued. "This is the first of the activities, and in the coming days we will continue planting trees. We're motivated by the slogan: 'They're burning, and we're planting.'" (Photo: Avi Rokach) The residents were also joined by soldiers from the Gaza Division's Northern Brigade, led by their commander, Col. Avi Rosenfeld. "We need to provide a response, and we will provide a response. We will continue defending the Gaza border communities. We won't grow tire and won't lose sight of our values," Col. Rosenfeld vowed.

Ten different fires broke out on Saturday in Israeli communities on the Gaza border—mostly in the Be'eri and Kissufim area—as a result of incendiary kites flown from the Gaza Strip. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Two of the fires broke out in the Kibbutz Nir Am area. As a result of these blazes, police briefly closed route 34 between Sderot and the Yad Mordechai Junction.

However, damage was caused to crops and wooded areas. Fire near Nir Am (Photo: Israel Police) Friday saw a new record with 45 fires breaking out out across the border area. Some 60 firefighters and 20 fire trucks worked to put out the flames.

There were no reports of casualties. The IDF said its aircraft fired warning shots at a group working on preparing explosive balloons. "The IDF views the use of explosive balloons and incendiary kites gravely and will act to prevent use of them," the army said. On Saturday evening, an IDF force arrested a Palestinian suspect who was trying to cross the border fence in northern Gaza. He was caught with a slingshot in his possession.

News article:
Kibbutz Nir Am – After years of rocket attacks and militant infiltrations from Gaza, residents of southern Israel are now coping with a new kind of threat: incendiary kites and balloons that have damaged farmlands and nature reserves. The crude devices launched by Palestinians inside the blockaded territory have not been lethal. But they have sparked fires that have damaged agriculture, killed wildlife and whipped up considerable indignation. “It’s caused significant economic damage but more than that it is emotional,” said Itzik Ebbo, 78, a member of Kibbutz Nir Am, a collective farming community. “These are crops we poured our hearts into. These are fields we hiked with our children and grandchildren.” Sullen locals have become a fixture on Israeli TV, guiding reporters around smoldering fields and lamenting the loss of life among snakes, turtles and the like. The phenomenon is the latest twist in nearly three months of intermittent Palestinian border protests. To many Israelis the “kite terrorism” is yet more evidence of implacable — and creative — Palestinian hostility. But viewed another way it is a desperate ploy on behalf of the 2 million Palestinians largely penned into the impoverished seaside strip. A decade-old blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt to weaken Gaza’s ruling Hamas militant group has ravaged the local economy and caused widespread despair. Israeli forces have killed more than 120 Palestinians and wounded over 3,800 since the protests began on March 30. Israel says it’s the only way to prevent mass breaches of the border that would include militants. But the vast majority of the Palestinian casualties have been unarmed, drawing heavy international criticism of Israel’s open-fire orders. Israel blames Gaza’s militant Hamas rulers for the bloodshed. Drifting aimlessly over the border, the kites have caused more than 450 fires over the past month, torching some 7,000 acres (2,800 hectares) of land and causing some $2 million in damages. Israel says it plans to deduct from tax funds it collects for the Palestinians to compensate farmers, and the military has been stepping up its measures in recent days by firing warning shots at launchers. Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman vowed Monday that “kite terrorism cannot continue.” But Israel’s decision-makers must also consider the risk of sparking all-out war, as happened four years ago. Israel accuses Hamas, a militant group that seeks its destruction, of using the protesters as cover in an effort to engineer violent infiltrations. The current round of violence has yet to claim any serious Israeli casualties. Israel’s Iron Dome defense system has neutralized much of the rocket fire. A nearly-completed underground barrier and new technological means have thwarted or destroyed much of the Hamas tunnel network. But Israel has struggled with the low-tech kites and balloons drifting over the border. Gazans began flying kites with burning rags or cotton-stuffed cans attached to them several weeks ago and have since added helium-filled balloons with incendiary material attached. Aided by the hot and windy conditions, the devices have dropped in dry brush, destroying wheat and sunflower fields and sending animals scurrying away. Palestinian activists argue such economic damage is not unlike that caused to them by the blockade. The launchers seem to take pride in their project. One of the leaders, an 18-year-old who asked to withhold his name for fear of Israel targeting him, said it started with bored teens flying Palestinian flags. “We wanted to provoke the Israelis more, so we attached a burning rag to the kite. Thanks to God’s will, the thread was cut and the kite fell on the other side and started a fire. This is how we got the idea,” he said, adding that a kite only cost $1 to make and a balloon just 50 cents. “Unless there are 15 to 20 fires, we don’t consider this a good day,” he added. The military says drones intercept some 90 percent of the devices and it has also fired shots near kite launchers, targeting what it says are vehicles and Hamas posts used to launch the kites. “These are not toys. These are dangerous weapons that are used in order to terrorize Israeli civilians,” said Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman. Conricus would not comment on calls by hard-line government ministers to kill kite launchers on the spot, as Israel does to those firing rockets. Meanwhile the fires rage daily. Terrain along the border is pockmarked with black spots of scorched hillsides and charred palm trees. In Nir Am, which abuts Gaza’s northeast border, the fires have inched dangerously close to adjacent train tracks and a gas station. Residents and visiting firefighting crews are on standby to deploy at a moment’s notice. “Balloons and kites should be something fun, not something to avoid,” said Betty Gavri, 77. In an effort to shift the narrative, kibbutz residents and their children recently floated colorful balloons and kites toward Gaza in what they said was a message of peace. They’ve also begun a replanting drive to replace the damaged fields. But Gavri is skeptical much will improve until larger changes in the region take place and the lives of Palestinians in Gaza improve as well. “I’m convinced that until they have something to lose there won’t be a big change on our doorstep,” she said. Kobi Sofer, a ranger for Israel’s Nature and Parks Authority, said vegetation could rebound relatively quickly but it will likely take many years, if at all, for the entire ecosystem of plants, predators and prey to recover. Sofer says he has seen scorched porcupines, snakes, turtles, lizards and other rodents and insects, not to mention their feeding grounds. Touring the area, the only animals in sight were birds pecking at charred carcasses. “All the years of rocket fire and military maneuvering never left anything like this,” said Sofer, a 17-year veteran ranger, as he gestured toward a scorched hilltop overlooking Gaza. “It’s a helpless feeling.”
