News article:
Iran’s top negotiator in Vienna said Wednesday that world powers are “closer than ever” to reaching an agreement to revive a multilateral nuclear accord, as the US said it was in the “very final stages” of indirect talks with the Islamic Republic. “After weeks of intensive talks, we are closer than ever to an agreement,” Iranian diplomat Ali Bagheri Kani wrote on Twitter before clarifying that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, though.” Kani urged negotiating partners to “be realistic,” adding that it was time for “serious decisions.” Asked about the status of talks in Vienna aimed at a joint US-Iran return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, State Department spokesman Ned Price said the parties were “in the midst of the very final stages” of talks and that the US would have a better assessment of Iran’s seriousness “in the coming days.” Indirect talks in Vienna between Iran and the United States on reviving the tattered agreement resumed last week after a 10-day hiatus.

News article:
Topic: Iran Nuclear Region: ViennaUnited StatesIran Blog Brand: The Buzz Tags: Nuclear Security Talks In Vienna, high-level diplomatic talks are meant to address Iran's ability to produce a nuclear weapon. But will they work? On Thursday, U.S. officials claimed they had made “substantial progress” toward reaching an agreement with Iran over the future of the country’s nuclear program after a months-long diplomatic standoff between Washington and Tehran. Despite this progress, however, ongoing issues between the two remain, putting the outcome of the final negotiating session in question. The Vienna negotiations have continued since late 2021 and are currently in their ninth round. The discussions are being held between Iran, Germany, and permanent members of the UN Security Council. Thus far, the Iranian delegation has refused to engage directly with the United States, blaming Washington for the country’s economic misfortunes following President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the original deal, the “Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action” (JCPOA), and his subsequent reimposition of sanctions in 2018. A State Department spokesperson claimed that, “if Iran shows seriousness, we can and should reach an understanding on mutual return to full implementation of the JCPOA within days,” according to Agence France-Presse. The spokesperson added, however, that “anything much beyond that”—e.g., an agreement attempting to resolve other issues in the U.S.-Iran relationship, such as Iran’s ballistic missile program or its support for Tehran-aligned private militias in neighboring countries—“would put the possibility of return to the deal at grave risk.” While Trump’s “maximum pressure” sanctions caused severe damage to the Iranian economy and led to an increase in tensions in the Persian Gulf region, it also allowed Iran to return to its enrichment of uranium—a process the country had largely abandoned following the JCPOA’s implementation in 2015. By now, Iran is estimated to have nearly enough highly-enriched uranium to create a nuclear weapon. Western diplomats have urged the creation of a settlement before the threshold is crossed; French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described the timeframe as “a matter of days.” Further, Iran has never acknowledged that it intends to construct a nuclear weapon, although blueprints for nuclear devices and nuclear-capable missiles have been found and stolen from Iranian government computers. Iranian authorities have requested a guarantee from the administration of President Joe Biden that the United States would remain within the deal for the foreseeable future to avoid a repeat of Trump’s 2018 JCPOA withdrawal. However, nearly two hundred members of the House of Representatives, all Republicans, published a letter earlier in the week explicitly announcing that “they would work to obstruct a renewed deal if certain controversial measures were not included.” This effectively indicates that a potential agreement is vulnerable to cancellation if the GOP reclaims the White House.

News article:
By Hassan Shokouhi nasab The eighth round of the talks in Vienna aimed at removing sanctions on Iran can be considered the longest, the most complex and, at the same time, the most sensitive political negotiations. In the meantime, positive signals have been transmitted from the Austrian capital, showing steps forward, which may be slow, but advancing contrary to those in recent years. One of these signals is the recent US move to restore sanctions waivers on some of Iran's civilian nuclear activities. On January 21, the US State Department informed Congress that it had suspended some sanctions against Iran's civilian nuclear activities in order to allow the two sides to return to their commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Although some described the US measure as a mere show in line with the interests of the sanctioning country rather than those of Iran, it is only part of the jigsaw puzzle in the provisions over which there is already an agreement as reported by the media. Observers believe the United States is pursuing both overt and covert objectives from this issue, ranging from reassuring its regional allies about the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear activities after an agreement and easing worries about Iran's nuclear breakout time to addressing domestic rifts in Congress as well as tensions between the White House and the Republicans. Behind-the-scenes goals of the dual use of "nuclear breakout" and "time constraints" The issue of "nuclear breakout,” i.e. the time needed for enrichment to produce an atomic bomb, has always been raised by the West and its Hebrew-Arab allies. The anti-Iranian axis uses the issue as a leverage to put pressure on Tehran and build a consensus against the Islamic Republic. They are pursuing their "Iranophobia" project by showing that Iran’s nuclear breakout time is near; This is while the country is not seeking to develop and use atomic bombs based on a fatwa (religious decree) by Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei. Mohammad Eslami, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), has also said that the country does not go beyond 60% uranium enrichment. Moreover, from the observers' point of view, the benefits that Iran derives from "reaching the threshold" far outweigh those of its "nuclearization." Regardless of Iran's official position, however, the Western media, from The Wall Street Journal to Axios, are trying to portray Iran’s nuclear breakout time as very near. The Wall Street Journal claims that this time is now less than a year and possibly reduced to six months, and Axios alleges that the time required for Tehran to produce an atomic bomb is a maximum of four to six months. Since the start of the eighth round of the Vienna talks until today, the element of "time" has been used as a tool to exert pressure on Iran and reduce Tehran's maximum demands. A look at the repeated positions of White House press secretary Jen Psaki and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and the unanimity of diplomats from the European trio regarding insufficient time reveal the portrayal of a state of emergency; A situation in which Iran is far from rational and deliberate decisions and trapped in excitement. However, as the eighth round of the Vienna talks lengthens, it can be understood that the Iranian team has prioritized achieving the desired result over reaching a swift unfavorable agreement. Congress’s help to White House in "potentially" final round of Vienna talks Now, at the last minute of the Vienna talks, when some news indicates the drafting of an agreement, US senators, disguised as opponents, came to the help of the White House in order to lower Tehran's expectations. The summoning of US Special Envoy for Iran Rober Malley to a secret meeting with members of Congress, as well as the letter of 33 Republican Senators addressed to President Joe Biden, can be assessed to that aim. Even if we assume that the dispute between Congress and the White House is not fabricated, the outcome of the tension is a temporary agreement; The deal, which Iran has opposed so far, but according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, there is still a long way to go before the 2015 Iran nuclear deal can be revived. It should be noted that in the JCPOA and subsequent UN Security Council Resolution 2231, temporary restrictions were considered for Tehran. In addition to the 15-year limit on Iran’s nuclear activities, the resolution included a five- and eight-year ban on Iran's arms and missile activities, which are called "sunset clauses." The arms embargo expired last year, and we will see the lifting of the restrictions on Iran’s missile program in the near future. This is one of the concerns of the West and its regional allies. So far, they have made endeavors to make the embargoes permanent, but they not gone nowhere. The empty place of the Parliament (Majlis), which previously helped reduce the West’s acts of sabotage by approving the plan of "proportionate, reciprocal action of the Iranian government in the implementation of the JCPOA" is felt, but Tehran has used other means of leverage at the current critical time. The firm positions of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, as well as the increasing defense-military capability, such as the unveiling of the strategic missile dubbed Khaybar Shekan, can be analyzed in this regard. Therefore, it is expected, by looking through realistic lenses and understanding the current situation, the West will stop making fictitious deadlines and playing the "nuclear breakout" and other worn-out fruitless games. It is also expected that Iran, as an influential player in the region and beyond, will agree to a win-win deal with reciprocal and balanced obligations and rights.

News article:
Dubai: Talks in Vienna on reviving the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers have made “significant progress”, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said on Monday. Separately, Iran’s top security official Ali Shamkhani said talks with European negotiators were ongoing and would continue while negotiations with the United States were not on the agenda because they would not be the source of “any breakthroughs”. Indirect talks between Tehran and Washington have been held in Vienna since April amid fears about Tehrans nuclear advances, seen by Western powers as irreversible unless agreement is struck soon. While Khatibzadeh said significant progress was made, he also noted that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed” in the Vienna talks. “The remaining issues are the hardest,” he told a weekly press briefing. Khatibzadeh said that Irans top security body, the Supreme National Security Council, handles the Vienna talks. It reports directly to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s top authority. Reuters reported last week that a US-Iranian deal is taking shape in Vienna after months of indirect talks to revive the nuclear pact, which Washington abandoned in 2018 under then-president Donald Trump. The draft text of the agreement also alluded to other issues, including unfreezing billions of dollars in Iranian funds in South Korean banks, and the release of Western prisoners held in Iran. Iran is ready to swap prisoners with the United States, Iran’s foreign minister said on Saturday, adding that talks to revive the nuclear deal could succeed “at the earliest possible time” if the United States made the necessary political decisions. The 2015 deal between Iran and major powers limited Iran’s enrichment of uranium to make it harder for Tehran to develop material for nuclear weapons, in return for a lifting of international sanctions against Tehran. Speaking from Doha on the sidelines of a gas conference, Iranian oil minister Javad Owji called the sanctions a violation of international law and a threat to global energy security, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. Iran has violated some of the deal’s nuclear limits since the United States withdrew from it and reimposed sanctions under Trump. Israel, Iran’s arch-foe, has been closely watching the Vienna talks. It is pressing Washington about the terms of an emerging Iranian nuclear deal, Israeli officials said on Monday, raising the prospect of a bilateral day-after agreement with Washington to address their worries.

Dubai: Talks in Vienna on reviving the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers have made “significant progress”, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said on Monday. Separately, Iran’s top security official Ali Shamkhani said talks with European negotiators were ongoing and would continue while negotiations with the United States were not on the agenda because they would not be the source of “any breakthroughs”. Indirect talks between Tehran and Washington have been held in Vienna since April amid fears about Tehrans nuclear advances, seen by Western powers as irreversible unless agreement is struck soon. While Khatibzadeh said significant progress was made, he also noted that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed” in the Vienna talks. “The remaining issues are the hardest,” he told a weekly press briefing. Khatibzadeh said that Irans top security body, the Supreme National Security Council, handles the Vienna talks. It reports directly to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s top authority. Reuters reported last week that a US-Iranian deal is taking shape in Vienna after months of indirect talks to revive the nuclear pact, which Washington abandoned in 2018 under then-president Donald Trump. The draft text of the agreement also alluded to other issues, including unfreezing billions of dollars in Iranian funds in South Korean banks, and the release of Western prisoners held in Iran.

Iran, on Monday, cited "significant progress" in talks with world powers in Vienna on reviving the 2015 nuclear deal, Anadolu News Agency reports. Foreign Ministry spokesman, Saeed Khatibzadeh, said Tehran insists on lifting all sanctions that contradict the nuclear deal. The spokesman, however, did not provide any details about the nature of the progress in the talks. Negotiations are under way in Vienna between delegations from Russia, China, Germany, France, the UK and Iran. Washington is indirectly involved in the talks. Iran nuclear deal draft puts prisoners, enrichment, cash first; oil comes later – diplomats The nuclear deal was signed between Iran and world powers in 2015, under which Iran was required to limit its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. However, in May 2018, former US President, Donald Trump, announced withdrawal from the landmark deal, followed by sanctions. In recent years, Iran has ramped up its nuclear activities as a counter-measure, stirring up tensions with the West. Meanwhile, Khatibzadeh said Iran is ready to hold talks with neighbouring countries, in a reference to Saudi statements about preparations to hold a fifth round of talks with Tehran. He said the success of the talks with Saudi Arabia depends on a real willingness from Riyadh to do so. On Saturday, Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud, said his country plans to hold a fifth round of direct talks with Tehran. "We are looking to schedule a fifth round of direct talks with Iran,, despite a lack of substantive progress so far," bin Farhan said in a speech at the Munich Security Conference. Tehran and Riyadh severed diplomatic relations in January 2016 following an attack on the Saudi Embassy in Tehran, after Shia cleric Nimr Al-Nimr was executed by Saudi authorities. 2015 nuclear deal has become an 'empty shell', Iran's top security official says The relationship between the two rivals deteriorated further after Iran, in September 2016, accused Riyadh of deliberately causing the deaths of around 400 Iranian pilgrims in a 2015 stampede in the Muslim holy city of Mecca. The two sides have since been engaged in a strong regional rivalry, often accusing each other of waging a proxy war for regional influence. The two regional rivals held four rounds of talks, hosted by Iraq, in an effort to normalise their relations and ease tensions between the two neighbours.

News article:
After almost a year of negotiations, talks in Vienna to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran are entering the 11th hour with signs on either side that talks are reaching what the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz described as “the moment of truth.” On Saturday French President Emmanuel Macron spoke for one and half hours with his Iranian counterpart, Ebrahim Raisi, to convince him to embrace a deal and hinted that talks had come to a solution respectful of all parties’ interests. While the Americans say the deal is a few weeks away, the French talk about days. Attending the Munich Security Conference on Sunday, Iran’s Foreign Minister Amir Abdollahian also reiterated that Tehran wants the US to show “tangible steps of goodwill,” in a possible reference to freeing Iran’s blocked funds abroad. The talks include a phased out revival where Iran would get back to 5 per cent uranium enrichment, unfreezing of Iranian assets abroad and the release of prisoners indicating reciprocal steps that aim at building confidence. US sanctions directly linked to Iran’s nuclear activities, slammed by the Donald Trump administration, would also be lifted. Aside from a few details — and incentives — the deal seems on the anvil. Not limited to its nuclear activities Even the Israelis who are against the revival of the deal appear to see it coming through. On Sunday Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said that Iran may “shortly” agree to a new nuclear deal with major powers but warned it will be weaker than the original 2015 agreement. And his Defence Minister Benny Gantz warned in Munich that Iran’s threat is not limited to its nuclear activities but extends to its drone system and its regional proxies. Talks on reviving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) have been held in Vienna since mid last year and they involve Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia directly and the United States indirectly. The revival of the agreement has been a divisive issue in US presidential elections in 2020 and continues to be in US Congress. Ironically, it is also a polarising issue for Iranian hardliners who called on the Raisi government to make sure that future US administrations cannot walk away from the agreement or impose the so-called “snapback mechanism”. If the deal is revived, even for a short time — since the US midterm elections are a few months away and a Republican victory would bode ill for the future of the agreement in the 2024 presidential elections — it could mean a major shift in current regional politics. Despite hard-line opposition, the deal would be a major relief for a suffocating Iranian economy where domestic discontent is on the rise. How the Iranian leadership will deal with sudden financial relief remains to be seen. Those opposed to any deal in the region will have to recalibrate their policies taking into consideration a number of factors including the fact that the US is slowly leaving the region, the aftermath of the current Russia-Ukraine standoff. A starting point On Saturday Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud, speaking at the Munich Security Conference, said the Kingdom was looking to schedule a fifth round of direct talks with Iran despite a “lack of substantive progress” in previous rounds. He added that if the 2015 nuclear pact was revived that should be “a starting point, not an end point” in order to address regional concerns, and that Riyadh remained interested in talks with Iran. While the revival of the nuclear deal with Iran may not cover critical issues like its regional agenda and its long-range missile and drone programmes, the onus will be on Tehran to change its behaviour and maintain good ties with its neighbours. That would be a major geopolitical shift that could lead to a more secure and stable Middle East. Failing to adhere to a new good neighbourly policy would be amiss and a major miscalculation by Tehran. Iran needs friends in the region and not enemies and it cannot do that by supporting non-state actors and other proxies. It is already a key regional player but it needs to understand that a new Middle East is emerging and that it has to behave as a normal state.

News article:
Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has told the European Union’s foreign policy chief that the Islamic Republic seeks a good agreement through the ongoing talks in the Austrian capital on the revival of the 2015 deal, but is determined not to cross its red lines. Amir-Abdollahian’s remarks came in a phone call with Josep Borrell on Saturday evening, during which the two sides discussed the latest situation of the talks that are aimed at reviving the landmark deal, which is officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The United States left the deal unilaterally in 2018 and returned the sanctions that had been lifted under the accord. Washington’s allies in the deal—France, Germany, and the United Kingdom—have been toeing the sanctions line closely by ending their trade activities with Iran. Since last year, Vienna has been hosting eight rounds of talks aimed at exploring the potential of the deal’s revival and fresh removal of the inhumane and illegal sanctions. During his Saturday conversation with Borrell, Iran's foreign minister expressed gratitude for the efforts made by the EU's foreign policy chief and his deputy, Enrique Mora, who is also the coordinator of the JCPOA revival talks. "It is the Islamic Republic's final decision not to cross its red lines" during the Vienna talks, Iran's foreign minister emphasized. On Sunday, an overwhelming majority of Iranian legislators issued a statement, calling on the administration of President Ebrahim Raeisi to adhere to Iran’s red lines as the talks inched forward in Vienna. They said the US government and its European allies had shown that they were not bound by any agreement over the past few years, so Iran was obliged to learn from the experience and set clear red lines. The red lines, according to the lawmakers, include guarantees by the United States and the three European signatories of the JCPOA that they would not abandon a potential agreement again and seek recourse to “the snapback mechanism,” which would reinstate the UN Security Council’s sanctions against Iran. They also asserted that all sanctions imposed under “false excuses” had to be removed. Elsewhere in his remarks, Amir-Abdollahian called it necessary for the opposite side in the Vienna talks to take the required “political decision” that could pave the way for the achievement of an agreement. “Iran is after a good agreement, but [one that would be] within the framework of [the country’s] national interests and does not violate its red lines,” the top diplomat said. Amir-Abdollahian and Borrell stressed that the talks have reached a sensitive and important juncture, adding that all the negotiating parties have gone the major part of the distance that they should cover. “Some important issues remain that could be resolved if the Western side adopted a realistic approach that would lead to realization of a final agreement,” the Iranian foreign minister noted. Borrell: Vienna talks at crucial juncture For his part, the EU's foreign policy chief affirmed that the Vienna talks have reached a decisive point at which all the concerned parties are needed to take serious decisions. Following the phone call, Iran's top diplomat took to Twitter, saying that he had discussed the draft of a possible agreement in Vienna with the EU's foreign policy chief in a serious manner. He added that all participating parties in the Vienna talks are trying to reach a good deal, adding, however, that "Our red lines are made clear to western parties."

News article:
Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani will return to the Austrian capital of Vienna to continue the eighth round of talks with senior representatives of the five remaining parties to the 2015 Iran deal on resolving the remaining issues pertaining to the agreement's revival. Bagheri Kani, who flew to Tehran last week for a short stay within the framework of ordinary travels to the capital, will return to Vienna Sunday night to pursue the negotiations "on the basis of a clear agenda with the purpose of settling problems in the way of achieving an agreement," IRNA reported. During its last session, Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) discussed the outcomes of the latest round of the Vienna talks, stressing the importance of ensuring the Islamic Republic's legal and rational demands based on the country's redlines, Nournews, a website close to the council reported on Sunday. It added that the council has also stressed "the need to quickly resolve the remaining issues that put the negotiations on the border between agreement and dead end," while emphasizing that the acceptance of any agreement depends on settlement of the outstanding issues. The United States unilaterally left the historic deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in 2018 and returned the sanctions that had been lifted under the accord. Washington’s European allies in the deal—France, Germany, and the United Kingdom—have been toeing the sanctions line closely by ending their trade activities with Iran. The Vienna talks began last April between Iran and the five remaining parties to the JCPOA — Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China — on the assumption that the US, under the Joe Biden administration, is willing to repeal the so-called maximum pressure policy pursued by former president, Donald Trump. Tehran says it won’t settle for anything less than the removal of all US sanctions in a verifiable manner. It also wants guarantees that Washington would not abandon the agreement again. In a Saturday phone call, Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told the European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell that the Islamic Republic seeks a good agreement through the ongoing talks in the Austrian capital, but is determined not to cross its redlines. "It is the Islamic Republic's final decision not to cross its redlines" during the Vienna talks, Iran's foreign minister emphasized. Amir-Abdollahian's remarks came few days after Iran’s lead negotiator said in a tweet that the Vienna talks are near conclusion, cautioning that there is no guarantee negotiators will be able to cross the “finish line” without “certain decisions” by the West. “Being near the finish line is no guarantee for crossing that. It requires extra caution, much perseverance, additional creativity and a balanced approach to take the last step,” he said, adding, “To finish the job, there are certain decisions that our Western interlocutors need to take.” ‘Iran accepts no deadlines for agreement from any country’ Also on Sunday, the spokesman for Iran’s Foreign Ministry said the Islamic Republic accepts no deadlines for the revival of the JCPOA during the ongoing talks in Vienna. Saeed Khatibzadeh, who was speaking to the IRIB news agency, was reacting to claims by certain Western media outlets that Washington has set a deadline for the achievement of an agreement in the Vienna talks. “So far, the Islamic Republic of Iran has accepted no deadlines from any country,” Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Asked about how optimistic he is about Iran clinching an agreement with the opposite side, Khatibzadeh said, “More than talking about optimism or pessimism in our negotiations, we must be realist.” “At the present time, we are at a point where the Vienna talks need a new political decision by the United States and other Western parties,” he added. "If the opposite sides respect reasonable and legitimate redlines of the Islamic Republic of Iran and take political decisions, they can be sure that finalizing an agreement will be possible in the shortest possible time." Khatibzadeh also stressed that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should end its "politically-motivated" claims on the issue of the so-called possible military dimensions (PMD) to Iran's peaceful nuclear program. "We have answered the agency's (IAEA) questions or even politically-motivated claims that we think were baseless about our certain measures taken by our country. This dossier should be closed," he said. Khatibzadeh added that the so-called PMD should not be used by the IAEA as a political pressure tool against Iran while others should not commit this mistake to use it in order to put the Islamic Republic under pressure.

Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani will return to the Austrian capital of Vienna to continue the eighth round of talks with senior representatives of the five remaining parties to the 2015 Iran deal on resolving the remaining issues pertaining to the agreement's revival. Bagheri Kani, who flew to Tehran last week for a short stay within the framework of ordinary travels to the capital, will return to Vienna Sunday night to pursue the negotiations "on the basis of a clear agenda with the purpose of settling problems in the way of achieving an agreement," IRNA reported. During its last session, Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) discussed the outcomes of the latest round of the Vienna talks, stressing the importance of ensuring the Islamic Republic's legal and rational demands based on the country's redlines, Nournews, a website close to the council reported on Sunday. It added that the council has also stressed "the need to quickly resolve the remaining issues that put the negotiations on the border between agreement and dead end," while emphasizing that the acceptance of any agreement depends on settlement of the outstanding issues. The United States unilaterally left the historic deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in 2018 and returned the sanctions that had been lifted under the accord.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian says the Vienna talks on the removal of anti-Iran sanctions and revival of the 2015 landmark deal have not reached a conclusion yet and it is time for the United States to make its difficult decision. Amir-Abdollahian made the remarks in a Monday hearing before the Iranian Parliament’s Committee on National Security and Foreign Policy. During the hearing, the Iranian foreign minister first explained about the efforts made by the incumbent Iranian administration and the negotiating team to clinch a deal through the ongoing talks in the Austrian capital. “The negotiations are not over yet and it is time for the United States to make difficult political decisions, but it has not made such decisions yet,” Iran’s top diplomat said. The US unilaterally left the 2015 agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in 2018 and re-stored the sanctions that had been lifted under the accord.

In a Saturday phone call, the Iranian foreign minister told European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell that the Islamic Republic seeks a good agreement through the ongoing talks in the Austrian capital, but is determined not to cross its red lines. During the Monday meeting, the Iranian lawmakers also stressed the importance of preserving the Islamic Republic's red lines on national interests in the course of the negotiations, including removing sanctions, and obtaining the necessary guarantees and the required opportunity for accurate verification. They emphasized that the Islamic Republic does not accept any deadline in securing its national interests and said, "The real deadline for the Iranian nation is the interests of the Iranian nation and the removal of obstacles in the way of Iran's foreign trade." The Iranian legislators added that they are concerned about safeguarding the country's nuclear capabilities, securing complete removal of sanctions and improving people's livelihood, saying they have prioritized economic benefit of the Iranian nation from the JCPOA through the removal of sanctions. More than 200 Iranian lawmakers issued a joint statement earlier this month, calling on the incumbent administration not to back down from its red lines and national interests in the course of the Vienna negotiations. “We must learn from the past and set the Iranian nation’s interest as a red line, and do not commit ourselves to any agreement unless necessary guarantees have been received,” the statement read.

Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh has warned the US administration against “bluffs and blusters” in the Vienna talks on the revival of the 2015 Iran deal, stressing that Tehran is willing to reach an agreement through negotiations but will not wait forever. Khatibzadeh made the comment in a post on his Twitter account early on Tuesday after US State Department’s spokesman Ned Price said Washington was prepared to walk away from the talks in the Austrian capital if Iran displayed “an intransigence to making progress.” The US is not a party to the Vienna talks because it is no longer a member of the nuclear deal, but it has sent a delegation to the Austrian capital to keep abreast of the negotiations. Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed that since the US was the party to have withdrawn from the landmark deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Tehran had to make sure it would not happen again. “US has already "walked away" from JCPOA. We must make sure it won't happen again. Everyone has its own plan B, though US' has proven hollow. Blusters & bluffs have/will not work. Decisions do,” Khatibzadeh tweeted. “A deal is at hand, if WH makes its mind. Iran is willing, but will not wait forever.” US has already "walked away" from JCPOA.

News article:
Iran’s foreign minister has underlined the significance of the remaining issues at the Vienna talks, saying the Western parties need to get realistic and make political decisions to reach an agreement on reviving the 2015 Iran deal. “Tehran has unveiled many initiatives to resolve the issue so far, and now reaching an agreement requires a political decision and a realistic attitude from the West,” Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said during a phone conversation with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on Wednesday. He stressed the need for the outcome of the Vienna process to safeguard Iran’s national interests, including in the economic sphere. In recent days, diplomats participating in the eighth round of negotiations in the Austrian capital have said that “a deal is within reach” provided that the remaining, narrowed-down issues are resolved. The Vienna talks began last April between Iran and the other parties to the Iran deal on the assumption that the US, under the Joe Biden administration, is willing to repeal the so-called maximum pressure policy against Tehran. Former US president Donald Trump instigated the maximum pressure campaign after he pulled the US out of the Iran deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in 2018 and unleashed what he called the “toughest ever” sanctions against the Islamic Republic. One key issue on which Iran and the US are now in agreement is that the maximum pressure campaign of sanctions has failed. At the talks, Tehran maintains that it won’t settle for anything less than the removal of all of those sanctions. It also seeks the formation of a verification regime on the removal of the sanctions, as well as guarantees that Washington would not abandon the agreement again. During his phone conversation, Amir-Abdollahian also expressed satisfaction with the close cooperation between Iran and China in Vienna and said it is vital that the two countries continue such a trend. For his part, the Chinese foreign minister also noted the close contacts between Tehran and Beijing in the Vienna talks, saying many achievements have been secured through coordination and joint efforts. Wang said the remaining issues in Vienna are important. China understands and supports the rational demands of the Iranian side, he said. He also expressed hope that the talks continue to make progress and ultimately lead to an agreement. In recent months, the United States and its three major European allies have repeatedly warned that there are “only a few weeks left” to strike a deal that would salvage the original JCPOA, warning to walk away from the talks. US State Department spokesman Ned Price reiterated on Monday that “we are prepared to walk away if Iran displays an intransigence to making progress.” A senior State Department official also said the signatories of the JCPOA only have a “handful of weeks left” to work out a deal, while claiming that Washington was not imposing an “artificial deadline” or “an ultimatum.” On the other side, Iran has remained calm and voiced readiness to ink a “good agreement” immediately, but at the same time, it has asserted that it would not agree to a flawed deal. The Islamic Republic has made clear that it wants “an airtight deal” bereft of any loopholes that the Americans and the Europeans could exploit again.

News article:
The United States is “getting closer” to reaching a new nuclear deal with Iran, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. Speaking to reporters during a daily press briefing, Psaki noted that there are “important components” that both sides have yet to agree on. She dismissed questions regarding the possibility of US sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine hindering talks in Vienna, saying both Moscow and Washington share a common goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Her comments came several hours after a meeting in the Latvian capital of Riga between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid. During the meeting, which also focused on the situation in Ukraine, Lapid noted Israel’s concerns about the nuclear negotiations potentially at the point of a breakthrough, saying Israel has well-known differences with the US on a deal, even if they share the end goal of preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “It’s no secret we have our differences on this, but it’s a conversation between allies that have a common goal, which is preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear threshold country, and to stop Iran’s ability to spread terror and instability all around the world,” Lapid said. Blinken responded that both Israel and the United States are “united and committed to the proposition that Iran must never obtain a nuclear weapon.” The foreign minister said the latest events in Ukraine are a reminder that Israel cannot rely on others to defend itself. Advertisement Noting that Israel reserves the right to act militarily against Iran’s nuclear program, Lapid said, “This war is a reminder to Israel. We have friends, we have allies, but our security must always be in our hands only.” The so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, signed in 2015, secured sanctions relief for Iran in return for strict curbs on its nuclear program. The agreement was between Iran on one side and Germany, China, the United States, France, Britain, and Russia on the other. The agreement unraveled when former US president Donald Trump withdrew from it, with Israeli encouragement, in 2018. Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium has now reached more than 15 times the limit set out in the 2015 accord, the UN’s IAEA nuclear watchdog said last week. The coming days are seen as critical by the West, which believes that the agreement could soon be irrelevant at the rate Iran is making nuclear advances. Advertisement Several observers believe that the West could leave the negotiating table and chalk the deal up to a failure if a compromise is not reached by this weekend. Among the problem points, Tehran is calling for the closure of the IAEA’s investigation into the presence of nuclear material at undeclared sites. IAEA Director General Rafael Gross, who has said the agency would “never abandon” its attempts to get Iran to clarify the previous presence of nuclear material at the sites, will travel to Iran on Saturday to meet with officials from the country.

News article:
Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian says achievement of a “good and strong” agreement is still possible through the ongoing talks in the Austrian capital, dismissing the “excessive demands” raised by the United States in the course of the negotiations. Iran’s top diplomat made the remarks in a Thursday phone call with the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, during which the two sides discussed the latest situation of the Vienna talks as well as some other international issues of mutual interest. Lauding the efforts made by Borrell’s deputy, Enrique Mora, in the Vienna talks and the progress made in the negotiations, Amir-Abdollahian said, “If realism governs all sides’ behaviors, it is still very possible to achieve a good and strong agreement.” “Raising certain new demands by the United States has no logical justification and is also at odds with this country’s positions on rapid achievement of an agreement,” Iran’s foreign minister said. “The axial issues [in the Vienna talks], and the effective removal of sanctions [imposed on Iran] must not be affected by the United States’ excessive demands,” Amir-Abdollahian emphasized. He said the US is not authorized to use public opinion pressure in the country as a pretext and convey a "new and different" message to Iran everyday via the EU coordinator in the Vienna talks. "If the American side has a problem with [convincing its] public opinion, I must say that we also have the public opinion problem in Iran. They [Iranian people] monitor developments [surrounding the Vienna talks] with high sensitivity and precision, and expect accountability and effective removal of sanctions as well as maintenance of a powerful peaceful nuclear capability from the government," the top Iranian diplomat pointed out. The United States left the 2015 Iran deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in 2018 and began to implement what it called the “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions against the Islamic Republic, depriving the country of the economic benefits of the agreement, including the removal of sanctions, for which Iran had agreed to put certain caps on its nuclear activities. In the meantime, the other parties to the deal, in particular France, Britain and Germany, only paid lip service to safeguarding Iran’s economic dividends as promised under the JCPOA, prompting Iran – after an entire year of “strategic patience” – to reduce its nuclear obligations in a legal move under the deal. The Vienna talks began last April between Iran and the remaining parties to the JCPOA- Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China- on the assumption that the US, under the Biden administration, is willing to repeal the so-called maximum pressure policy pursued by former president, Donald Trump, against Tehran. Iranian President Ebrahim Raeisi said on Tuesday that Tehran has not backed down on any of its red lines in the ongoing negotiations in Vienna on a possible revival of the JCPOA and it will never do so in the future. “In the first step, the administration has seriously pursued neutralizing the sanctions and, in the second step, it seeks the removal of the sanctions during the negotiations in full dignity,” he added. Vienna talks at sensitive phase; US, Iran must show flexibility: Borrell The EU foreign policy chief, for his part, said the Vienna talks between Iran and the P4+1 group of countries have reached a sensitive point, urging both Tehran and Washington to show more flexibility in messages they exchange and to make efforts to heed time limits. Borrell added that the EU supports the issue of economic guarantees, which is important to and has been requested by Iran. Iran and the EU would continue efforts aimed at helping Tehran and the five remaining parties to the JCPOA reach an agreement in Vienna, he said, adding that Iranians have proven themselves to be tough and highly capable negotiators. Iran top negotiator, EU coordinator meet in Vienna Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani and Enrique Mora, the European Union's coordinator for the talks, held a bilateral meeting in the Austrian capital on Thursday.

News article:
Threatening Chinese Firms The standoff between the US and Russia over Ukraine, now expanding into China. Washington warns Chinese firms over evading export controls and sanctions the US says will impose on Russia if it invades Ukraine. Washington says it has an array of tools it can deploy, if foreign firms, including those in China, get around U-S sanctions. It says Russia won’t be able to make up for the consequences, even if it gets closer to China. The reaction came after China said Beijing and Moscow had coordinated their position on Ukraine during a meeting between their foreign ministers. Russian president Vladimir Putin has also met his Chinese counterpart XI Jinping in Beijing. Moscow denies US allegations that Russia prepares to invade Ukraine. Moscow says Washington wants to drag it into war. Bahrain-Israel Ties Bahrain’s main opposition group, al-Wefaq, says any security or military agreement between the kingdom and Israel is unlawful and has no legitimacy. Al-Wefaq says the Bahraini regime is in crisis and has no authority to take such actions on behalf of its people. The group also slammed the Thursday visit by the Israeli minister of military affairs to Bahrain, saying it crossed red lines. During the visit, Benny Gantz signed a security agreement, the first between the regime and a Persian Gulf Arab state. Bahrain and several other Arab states established diplomatic relations with Israel two years ago under US-brokered deals. Palestinians see normalization with Israel as a stab in their back and a betrayal of their cause. Racial Tensions In US Activists in the US city of Chicago call for justice, after a white former police officer convicted of murdering a black teenager in 2014 was released early from prison. Justice is on trial now. That’s what Chicago’s Catholic Priest Father said at a rally against the early release of ex-cop, Jason Van Dyke. He was freed after 39 months in prison instead of serving an 81-month sentence. Chicago authorities say the ex-cop showed good behavior while in detention. Van Dyke murdered Laquan McDonald, 17 years old, in October 2014. But, he was charged more than a year later, following public pressure. That happened after released dash cam video showed Van Dyke shooting McDonald 16 times within seconds, as the teenager was walking away. African Americans have long been subjected to brutality by white police officers, with the majority of cases going unpunished.

News article:
Iran leader warning Leader of Iran's Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei says the United States is taking a blow from where it least expected. Ayatollah Khamenei noted that the previous and current US presidents have joined hands to further disgrace Washington.

Taiwan, however, has welcomed the US move, saying the deal will take effect in March. Washington has increased its military support to Taipei over the past years, amid rising tensions with Beijing. China considers Taiwan as an inseparable part of its territory, and has warned Washington that it could trigger war by further pushing the island territory to seek independence.

News article:
'West must remove Iran sanctions' The Iranian foreign minister has called on the West to adopt a realistic stance in the JCPOA revival talks and make a serious and effective decision with regards to the removal of sanctions. In a phone call with his Chinese counterpart, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said the West must demonstrate its meaningful departure from the failed policies of the former US administration. He said this is possible through the removal of all sanctions inconsistent with the 2015 deal and the adoption of serious measures to provide guarantees that the US will not abandon the deal again. For his part, the Chinese foreign minister said the US’s unilateral withdrawal from the deal in 2018 has inflicted damage on Iran and violated its legitimate rights. Wang Yi said Beijing supports Tehran’s reasonable demands and proposals in the talks in Vienna. Russia-West tensions The Russian president says his country’s military buildup is conducted on its own soil, dismissing as baseless allegations that Russia is posing a threat to Ukraine. Vladimir Putin made the remarks at a joint press conference with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron in Moscow. Putin warned that European countries will be drawn into a military conflict with Russia in case NATO admits Ukraine as a member. He expressed hope that the standoff over Ukraine will be settled through dialogue, referring to concerns that Moscow expects the West to respond to. During the conference, Macron talked about the security guarantees he has proposed to Putin. UK's economic woes The United Kingdom is facing a rise in inflation at rates not seen in the past three decades. A major retail company is now warning that the worst is yet to come. Britain’s biggest retailer, Tesco, says the prices of its products can go up as much as five percent in the months to come. The company blames the matter on the rise in energy bills. That’s partly due to the cold winter, lower gas deliveries from Russia, and tensions in East Europe. Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates for the second time in three months after forecasting that the peak inflation will reach record 7-percent in April.

News article:
'US political divisions' Secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, says political divisions within the US ruling establishment prevent Washington from making political decisions needed to advance the JCPOA revival talks in Vienna. In a Twitter post, Shamkhani said the US government cannot make up for its domestic crises by violating the rights of the Iranian people. A few days ago, the US granted a series of sanctions waivers to Iran. But now, some Republican lawmakers are expressing outrage at Washington over that decision. In a classified testimony before Congress, the US special envoy for Iran, Robert Malley, Republican lawmakers have called for a public hearing. They said the Biden administration has not been transparent about the process of its conduct regarding the JCPOA. The US unilaterally withdrew from the accord in 2018, and now Tehran is calling for guarantees against any violations in the future. 'Israel normalization doomed to fail' The secretary-general of Lebanon’s Hezbollah Resistance Movement says Iran’s foes cannot easily attack the country. In an interview with Iran’s Al-Alam TV, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said it is not in the US interest to attack Iran, as it cannot stop Tehran’s peaceful nuclear activities. Nasrallah said he believes Israel’s repeated threats in recent months to attack Iran’s nuclear sites are all empty words and the regime will not make the mistake of launching a war on Iran. Nasrallah said Tel Aviv knows if it strikes Iran, the response will be harsh, decisive and precise. He said some Arab states that normalized ties with Israel cannot help the regime militarily. Nasrallah also touched on recent diplomatic contacts between Israel and some Arab states. He said Israel’s plan to normalize ties with the Arab world is doomed to failure since people in the region oppose it. Hajib ban protests Schools in a southern Indian state will remain closed for three days, because of the controversy and the protests that a ban on wearing hijab has sparked there. The demonstrations in Karnataka state erupted after schools ordered Muslim students not to wear their Islamic headscarves and prohibited them from entering classrooms. The order has spread to other educational institutions. The state’ top court has begun hearing a petition that challenges the legality of the ban. The situation has gravely concerned Muslim minorities. They are expressing a growing fear of increasing persecution at the hands of the nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

JCPOA revival talks Iran’s president has taken a jab at the administration of US President Joe Biden for sticking to the failed policies of its predecessor against the Islamic Republic. Ebrahim Raeisi noted that this approach is the main obstacle to achieving acceptable progress toward reviving the 2015 deal known as the JCPOA. Raeisi made the comments in a phone call with the Japanese prime minister. Fumio Kishida, for his part, expressed his country’s support for restoring the accord. Iran and the remaining signatories to the JCPOA resumed talks in the Austrian capital on Tuesday. Iran wants the removal of sanctions that the US imposed following its unilateral withdrawal from the deal in 2018. Tehran also seeks guarantees that Washington won’t leave the deal again. Iran-Malaysia relations Iran and Malaysia can strengthen economic ties despite US sanctions. That’s according to Malaysia’s Plantation Industries and Commodities minister Zuraida Kamaruddin. In an exclusive interview with Press TV, Kamaruddin says the two countries can use barter for their trade transactions as a way to get around the US sanctions. She says Tehran and Kuala Lumpur are discussing the possibility of using local currencies, which could greatly boost the volume of bilateral trade. The Malaysian minister believes Iran has the potential to become a hub for the export of Malaysian commodities, particularly palm oil to Central Asia. Canada trucker protests Protests in the Canadian capital Ottawa against Covid-19 restrictions drag for almost two weeks as authorities warn of economic damage to the country. The protesters, opposing a vaccine or quarantine mandate for cross-border truckers, have also blocked two main crossings to the United States. A key link used to move goods between the two neighbors known as the Ambassador Bridge, has been shut since Monday night. Another border crossing in Alberta has also been closed since Tuesday night. Police have threatened to arrest protesters blocking Ottawa streets. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called the blockades unacceptable and a threat to the economy. The White House has also warned that the protest action risks hurting the auto industry.

News article:
Iran president speech Iran’s President Ebrahim Raeisi met with dozens of foreign ambassadors in Tehran on the occasion of the 43rd anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. During his speech at the event, the president drew an analogy between the current and the former US administrations. He said the Biden administration is no different from its predecessor in its policies and actions. The president also talked about Iran's 2015 deal, saying the status quo is the result of Washington’s withdrawal and the inaction of other signatories. President Raeisi said diplomacy only works when all sides abide by their commitments. And pointing out to the ongoing Vienna talks, he said any negotiations should guarantee Iran’s national interests. Yemen downs aircraft The Yemeni army says it has shot down another intruding Saudi spy drone. The spokesman for the Yemeni Armed Forces says air defenses downed the CH-4 spy aircraft while carrying out hostile acts over Hajjah province. Yahya Saree adds that the surface-to-air missile targeting the plane has not yet been unveiled. Yemen has brought down tens of drones in the course of Saudi Arabia’s seven-year aggression on the country. The war has left hundreds of thousands of Yemenis dead, and displaced millions more. It has also destroyed Yemen’s infrastructure and spread infectious diseases. Syria condemning Israeli strikes Syria has strongly condemned Israel’s latest missile strike on its territory. The Foreign Ministry says the aggression is a violation of international law, UN principles and its resolutions. It says the attacks come amid an international silence and under the protection of the US that encourages Tel Aviv to repeat its aggression on Syria. It says Damascus has the right to use all legitimate means to respond. Israel unleashed a missile strike on Qudsayya City near the capital Damascus early Wednesday. A soldier was killed and five others were wounded. It also caused damage to residential buildings.

News article:
Iran president speech Iran’s President Ebrahim Raeisi met with dozens of foreign ambassadors in Tehran on the occasion of the 43rd anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. During his speech at the event, the president drew an analogy between the current and the former US administrations. He said the Biden administration is no different from its predecessor in its policies and actions. The president also talked about Iran's 2015 deal, saying the status quo is the result of Washington’s withdrawal and the inaction of other signatories. President Raeisi said diplomacy only works when all sides abide by their commitments. And pointing out to the ongoing Vienna talks, he said any negotiations should guarantee Iran’s national interests. Yemen downs aircraft The Yemeni army says it has shot down another intruding Saudi spy drone. The spokesman for the Yemeni Armed Forces says air defenses downed the CH-4 spy aircraft while carrying out hostile acts over Hajjah province. Yahya Saree adds that the surface-to-air missile targeting the plane has not yet been unveiled. Yemen has brought down tens of drones in the course of Saudi Arabia’s seven-year aggression on the country. The war has left hundreds of thousands of Yemenis dead, and displaced millions more. It has also destroyed Yemen’s infrastructure and spread infectious diseases. Syria condemning Israeli strikes Syria has strongly condemned Israel’s latest missile strike on its territory. The Foreign Ministry says the aggression is a violation of international law, UN principles and its resolutions. It says the attacks come amid an international silence and under the protection of the US that encourages Tel Aviv to repeat its aggression on Syria. It says Damascus has the right to use all legitimate means to respond. Israel unleashed a missile strike on Qudsayya City near the capital Damascus early Wednesday. A soldier was killed and five others were wounded. It also caused damage to residential buildings.

News article:
Iran political independence Iranians have taken to the streets all across the country to mark the 43rd anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution. But the coronavirus pandemic has given a different look to this national celebration. US stealing Afghan money The Taliban have slammed as theft, an executive order by the US president that allows Washington to seize half of the Afghan funds frozen in New York’s Federal Reserve. A Taliban spokesman says the move represents the lowest level of the human and moral decay of a country. Under the order, half of the 7 billion dollars of Afghan assets held in the US could be used to compensate families of 9/11 victims. The other half can be released for humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. The move on the funds is pending a judicial decision. A senior US administration official says it will take months to unfreeze funds for aid to Afghanistan. This comes as rights groups and the United Nations have warned of a deteriorating humanitarian crisis in the country. “West’s disinformation on Ukraine” Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu says Moscow’s ties with London have hit the rock bottom as their tensions soar over Ukraine. Shoigu also called for steps to reduce existing tensions. He slammed the West for what he called goring Ukraine with weapons. Shoigu stressed that Moscow does not plan to invade the country. He made the comments during a meeting with his British counterpart Ben Wallace in Moscow. Wallace said British troops are in Ukraine for training purposes. He claimed that the weapons Britain supplied to Ukraine also don’t pose a threat to Russia. He warned Moscow of tragic consequences in case of an invasion. The British defense secretary however expressed hope for de-escalation with Russia.

News article:
Sanctions crime against humanity Iran’s deputy ambassador to the United Nations says unilateral sanctions against her country amount to crimes against humanity. Zahra Ershadi denounced the sanctions on medication and humanitarian goods. She said a lot of Iranian children have lost their lives due to drug shortages caused by such inhuman bans. The Iranian envoy stressed that countries which impose sanctions on other nations should not go unpunished. Ershadi emphasized that her country demands an immediate halt to all coercive measures, including imposing sanctions. She said a removal of sanctions on Iran can provide the country with guarantees for achieving economic and social development. The United States has imposed illegal sanctions against Iran with the aim of crippling its economy. It further stepped up the bans after unilaterally withdrawing from the 2015 deal. ‘Iran not to compromise on redlines’ Iran tells the EU foreign policy chief that it will not back down from its redlines in the Vienna negotiations, blaming the West’s lack of serious will for prolongation of the talks. Israeli PM in Bahrain Palestinian resistance movements condemn the Israeli prime minister’s visit to Bahrain. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said such visits can never legitimize the regime’s occupation of Palestinian lands. Barhoum held Bennett responsible for the atrocities Israeli forces commit against Palestinian people. Also the Islamic Jihad movement strongly condemned Bahrain for hosting the Israeli prime minister, saying such trips bring nothing but threat and danger to Arab states. Bennett arrived in Manama on Monday and will meet Bahrain's Crown Prince and Prime Minister during his two-day stay in the country. Meanwhile, hundreds of people rallied in Manama to voice solidarity with Palestinians and denounce Bennett’s visit, which coincides with the anniversary of their 2011 uprising against the Al Khalifa regime.

News article:
Russia troops withdrawal Baseless hysteria: that’s how Moscow describes as the West’s allegation regarding an imminent Russian attack on neighboring Ukraine. Repeated accusations of a possible Russian attack on Ukraine by the US and its Western allies have heightened tensions in Eastern Europe for weeks now. On Tuesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz held talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Moscow yet another attempt by a European leader to ease the ongoing tensions. During a joint presser following the meeting Scholz said all Europeans are aware that sustainable security on the continent can only be achieved together with Russia. Putin, for his part, stressed that his country is not after a war in Europe. US “non- compliance” Tehran calls on the western parties to the 2015 deal to take a realistic approach toward the Vienna talks. The Iranian foreign minister says in that case, a good deal will be within reach. Hossein Amir-Abdollahian made the remarks in a tweet following a phone call with his British counterpart, Elizabeth Truss. This as Iran and the remaining signatories to the JCPOA are engaged in intensive negotiations in Vienna to restore the agreement, left in limbo following the US withdrawal in 2018. Iran’s top security official has however, warned that the proven US non-compliance is the most significant threat to any agreement. Ali Shamkhani says the verifiable removal of sanctions and guarantees, the two main demands set out by Iran, are the integral part of a good agreement. Iran has also repeatedly dismissed any outside interference in the Vienna talks between the JCPOA signatories. US seizure of Afghan money Protesters also demanded Washington compensate tens of thousands of Afghans killed during the US-led war on the country over the past two decades. Washington’s decision to seize Afghan funds comes as the country’s economy is on the brink of collapse. Afghanistan relied heavily on international aid but that too stopped once the Taliban rose to power in August, last year.

News article:
JCPOA revival talks The Iranian president says any Vienna deal must entail the removal of anti-Iran sanctions and the provision of credible guarantees. Ebrahim Raeisi made the remark in a phone call with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron. He said Iran continues the negotiations with seriousness and has offered constructive proposals. The president noted that Tehran has assessed the proposals put forward by the other sides based on their conformity with the interests of the Iranian nation. Raeisi also warned against any anti-Iran political pressures, saying such measures could weaken the prospects of reaching an agreement. Meanwhile, Iran's foreign minister, who is attending the Munich Security Conference, says the revival of the 2015 deal hinges on the political decisions made by the other sides. Canada anti-vaccine protest Canadian police have clashed with protesters in the capital Ottawa, using pepper spray and stun grenades to disperse the weeks-long demonstrations against covid restrictions. The clashes come as security forces move closer to the hub of the anti-mandate protest that has gripped the city for three weeks. So far, more than 140 people have been arrested and dozens of vehicles seized over the past two days. Organizers of the so-called Freedom Convoy said they have asked trucks to withdraw because of heavy-handed police tactics. The massive crackdown comes after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked emergency powers to stop the protests. The demonstrations were started by Canadian truckers opposing an order demanding unvaccinated cross-border drivers to quarantine. The protests have turned into a rallying point for people opposing various policies of Trudeau’s government. Storm Eunice aftermath A fierce Atlantic storm has wreaked havoc across northwestern Europe killing at least 14 people and causing massive power outages. Storm Eunice pummeled Britain with record breaking winds ripping off rooftops and knocking nearly one million homes off the power grid. British energy Networks Association says over 155,000 households still remain without power. Meteorologists say the record gusts of wind reached nearly 200 kilometres per hour in some places in Britain. Authorities there issued a red weather alert that means Eunice could cause damage to life. Deaths from the storm were reported in Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland, which were caused by flying debris and falling trees. The storm has also hit other areas of Europe including Germany and Denmark under new names.

News article:
Ukraine crisis Russia recognizes the independence of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, accusing the West-backed government in Kiev of committing genocide there. In his speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that Kiev immediately end military operations or face responsibility for possible bloodshed. The announcement brought people to the streets in the breakaway regions for celebrations. In a decree issued shortly after the announcement, Putin told the country’s defense ministry to deploy troops to the two regions under a peacekeeping mission. Moscow is yet to provide details or date for any deployment. Russia has already denied any plans to attack Ukraine or annex Donetsk and Luhansk. Meanwhile, Putin has accused the West of cheating Moscow and dishonoring its promise of stopping NATO’s eastward expansion. Call for cooperation The sixth summit of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum is underway in the Qatari capital, Doha. In an address to the session on Tuesday, Iran’s President Ebrahim Raeisi slammed US sanctions on the oil and gas industry of some member states. Raeisi called for boosting cooperation among the member states to circumvent those measures. He said collaboration among the member states can bring about better economic conditions for all GECF members. The Iranian president noted that the Islamic Republic has a collective strategy for good cooperation. He said Tehran seeks to increase its export power. Raeisi described natural gas as a clean source of energy, saying utilizing such energy can bring about major advantages. China warns US China issues a warning to the United States over its plan to include Taiwan in its Indo-Pacific strategy. China's foreign minister says Washington’s move is sending all the wrong signals. Wang Yi has told his American counterpart that Beijing is still willing to manage its differences with Washington and stabilize bilateral ties. Earlier this month, the US said it would work with allies in the region to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. China strongly opposes Washington's increased military and political support for Taiwan, as it considers the self-ruled island an inseparable part of its territory. On Monday, Beijing imposed sanctions on two American firms over a pending 100-million dollar arms sale to Taiwan.

News article:
Grossi in Tehran Head of the international Atomic energy agency Rafael Grossi says safeguards issues with Iran should be resolved in order for the 2015 deal to be revived. Grossi was speaking at a press conference with the head of Iran’s atomic energy organization in Tehran. The IAEA chief said his talks with Mohammad Eslami were fruitful and intense. Grossi said there’s an understanding that the two sides should work together so that all issues are clarified. Grossi is due to meet with Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir-abdollahian later on Saturday. His Tehran visit comes as Iran and the remaining parties to the 2015 deal continue talks in Vienna to revive the accord. Those talks have now entered their final stage. 'Israel common enemy of Muslims' Secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani calls Israel the biggest enemy of the Muslim world. Shamkhani made the comment in a tweet after the Saudi crown prince talked about the kingdom’s relationship with the Israeli regime. Mohammad bin Salman said Riyadh is looking for ways to coexist with Iran but doesn’t look at Israel as an enemy. He also said, Tel Aviv will probably be an ally of Riyadh in the future. The top Iranian security official also referred to bilateral talks between Tehran and Riyadh. He said the talks, hosted by Iraq, stem from Iran’s principled strategy of cooperating with its neighbors based on bilateral and regional interests. Those talks are aimed at defusing tensions over a host of issues including the Yemen war. Russia partial ceasefire The Russian defense ministry announces a ceasefire to allow residents of two Ukrainian cities to evacuate. According to a ministry statement, the ceasefire has taken effect on 7 GMT Saturday in Mariupol and Volnovakha. The ministry has not said how long the truce will remain in effect in the two Ukrainian cities now surrounded by Russian forces. Russian media say the defense ministry has determined humanitarian corridors and exit points in an agreement with the Ukrainian authorities. The truce announcement came after Mariupol's mayor asked for humanitarian corridors, saying his city was under blockade. Mariupol has about half a million population and is a strategic port city.

News article:
Grossi in Tehran Head of the international Atomic energy agency Rafael Grossi says safeguards issues with Iran should be resolved in order for the 2015 deal to be revived. Grossi was speaking at a press conference with the head of Iran’s atomic energy organization in Tehran. The IAEA chief said his talks with Mohammad Eslami were fruitful and intense. Grossi said there’s an understanding that the two sides should work together so that all issues are clarified. Grossi is due to meet with Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir-abdollahian later on Saturday. His Tehran visit comes as Iran and the remaining parties to the 2015 deal continue talks in Vienna to revive the accord. Those talks have now entered their final stage. 'Israel common enemy of Muslims' Secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani calls Israel the biggest enemy of the Muslim world. Shamkhani made the comment in a tweet after the Saudi crown prince talked about the kingdom’s relationship with the Israeli regime. Mohammad bin Salman said Riyadh is looking for ways to coexist with Iran but doesn’t look at Israel as an enemy. He also said, Tel Aviv will probably be an ally of Riyadh in the future. The top Iranian security official also referred to bilateral talks between Tehran and Riyadh. He said the talks, hosted by Iraq, stem from Iran’s principled strategy of cooperating with its neighbors based on bilateral and regional interests. Those talks are aimed at defusing tensions over a host of issues including the Yemen war. Russia partial ceasefire The Russian defense ministry announces a ceasefire to allow residents of two Ukrainian cities to evacuate. According to a ministry statement, the ceasefire has taken effect on 7 GMT Saturday in Mariupol and Volnovakha. The ministry has not said how long the truce will remain in effect in the two Ukrainian cities now surrounded by Russian forces. Russian media say the defense ministry has determined humanitarian corridors and exit points in an agreement with the Ukrainian authorities. The truce announcement came after Mariupol's mayor asked for humanitarian corridors, saying his city was under blockade. Mariupol has about half a million population and is a strategic port city.

News article:
Russia case against Facebook Instagram The online video sharing platform YouTube says it is blocking access, globally to media funded by the Russian government. The American platform says the decision is in line with its policy of barring content that denies, minimizes or trivializes violent events. Earlier this month, YouTube also blocked leading Russian channels RT and Sputnik, across Europe amid Russia’s military operation on Ukraine. Meanwhile the American company Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, says it is allowing posts that call for violence against Russian forces. In response Moscow says it is restricting access to Instagram and has launched criminal proceedings against its parent company. The United Nations has also warned that the anti-Moscow move could spark hate speech against Russians. “War no solution to Ukraine crisis” Iran’s foreign minister reiterates the Islamic Republic’s stance regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict. And that is ending the conflict through a political resolution. Hossein Amir Abdollahian says war is not a solution in Ukraine, just as in Yemen, Afghanistan or anywhere else. He made the remarks in a phone conversation with his Polish counterpart Zbigniev Rao. The Iranian top diplomat also thanked the Polish government for its assistance to refugees of the Ukrainian conflict, especially the Iranian citizens. Amir Abdollahian said Iran is prepared to send humanitarian aid to refugees in Poland. The polish diplomat welcomed the offer. He called on the international community to send more humanitarian aid to Ukraine and its neighboring countries. Israel terror attack in Syria Iran says it reserves the right to respond to the Israeli terrorist attack that killed two military advisors in Syria. The Iranian mission to the United Nations says the attack was highly provocative, and aimed at increasing tensions. In a letter to the Security Council, the mission seriously warned Israel against taking further adventurist and malevolent measures. The mission also described the attack as a criminal act that violates international law and the United Nations Charter. It called on the international community to firmly condemn such actions and hold Israel accountable. On March 7, the regime launched airstrikes at a site near the Syrian capital Damascus. They killed two members of Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps who were in Syria on an advisory role.

Israel center in Erbil hit Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps says it has conducted missile strikes on a strategic Israeli center in the capital of Iraq’s Kurdistan region. The IRGC says its precision-strike missiles hit the center in response to the crimes of the Zionists. The IRGC has warned Israel of a strong and destructive response if it repeats its acts of aggression. Footage emerged on Sunday of explosions in the Iraqi city of Erbil. Media reports suggested the target had been secret centers operated by the Israeli spy agency Mossad. It was also reported that the strike had destroyed a building and killed several Mossad officers. Earlier this week, two Iranian military advisors were killed in Israeli airstrikes near the Syrian capital Damascus. Following that attack, the IRGC said Israel would definitely pay the price for its criminal act. Russia-Ukraine conflict: Day 18 Day 18 of the Russian offensive in Ukraine. Several major cities are witnessing heavy fighting. Russian forces have advanced closer to Kiev from several directions. In the nearby town of Irpin, a US journalist was killed and another wounded. To the west, a Russian missile attack hit a large military facility near the border with Poland, killing 35 people. Another nine people lost their lives in airstrikes on the southern city of Mykolayiv. Eastward in Mariupol, officials say nearly 2,200 residents have been killed since the start of the conflict. They also say the port city, under Russian siege, is running out of food and water. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says Russia is blocking a humanitarian convoy heading to Mariupol. China COVID lockdown Millions of people across China are facing lockdowns amid a surge in coronavirus infections. The sharp rise in cases has prompted authorities to close schools in Shanghai and put all 17 million residents in the southeastern city of Shenzhen under a citywide lockdown. Almost 18 provinces are battling clusters of the Omicron and Delta variants. The latest flare-up has been driven by the highly transmissible Omicron strain and a spike in asymptomatic cases. China, where the virus was first detected in late 2019, has maintained a strict zero-Covid policy enforced by swift lockdowns, travel restrictions and mass testing, when clusters have emerged.

News article:
Russia- Ukraine talks Russian and Ukrainian officials have given their most upbeat assessments yet of progress in their negotiations on the ongoing Russian offensive in Ukraine. The two sides also suggested there could be positive results within days. Kiev said it was willing to negotiate, but not to surrender or accept any ultimatums. Ukraine also made it clear that it wanted an end to the war and the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from its soil. It noted that the two countries could achieve some results in a matter of days. Meanwhile, Russia said the talks had made substantial progress, and will continue on Monday. Separately, the US said Russia was showing signs of willingness to engage in substantive negotiations on ending the Ukraine conflict. “Field, diplomacy serve Iran’s interests” Iran's top security official highlights the balance between field and diplomacy in his country’s policy, alluding to them as two components of the Islamic republic’s power. In a tweet, Ali Shamkhani said Iran uses both field and diplomacy proportionally and wisely to safeguard its security and national interests. He said, over forty years of experience has taught Iranians that relying on Western or Eastern powers would not guarantee their rights and securities. Shamkhani’s remark came hours after Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps carried out a strike on a strategic Israeli center in the Iraqi city of Erbil.

News article:
Israel rejected Friday evening the new peace initiative by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius. A senior Israeli official said that Fabius' threat to recognize a Palestinian state should the talks reach a dead end effectively incentivizes the Palestinians to try to see the talks end in deadlock. "The foreign minister of France says up front that if his initiative reaches a dead end, France will recognize a Palestinian state. This statement is an incentive for the Palestinians to bring about a dead end. Negotiations cannot be held nor peace achieved in this manner." Fabius announced Friday that France will try to convene an international peace summit in the next few weeks to renew diplomatic efforts between Israeli and the Palestinians. Fabius threatened that should the diplomatic offensive fail, France will formally recognize a Palestinian state. The Palestinians welcome the French call "for serious international involvement towards ending the Israeli occupation that began in 1967," the PLO's negotiations affairs department, led by chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, said in a statement. Open gallery view French Foreign Affairs minister Laurent Fabius waves as he arrives before a meeting with the Iranian president at the Elysee Palace in Paris on January 28, 2016. Credit: AFP "We will be contacting France, as well as other international partners, to advance in that direction (of an international conference). We have been calling upon the international community to have an international conference for Palestine based on international law and UN resolutions," Erekat said. Speaking in Paris at a conference of French diplomats, Fabius said "unfortunately, [Israeli] settlement construction continues. We must not let the two-state solution unravel. It is our responsibility as a permanent member of the UN Security Council." In December 2014, France tried to push for a UN Security Council resolution to lay down a framework for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However, these efforts failed due to opposition from Israel and the U.S. on one hand, and an unwillingness of the Palestinians on the other to compromise on the exact wording of the decision in order to win final approval from the Obama administration. In the summer of 2015, France raised the possibility of creating an international support group for peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. This group met on the sidelines of the UN last September. The meeting was attended by the foreign ministers of Quartet-member nations (U.S., Russia, the EU and the UN) together with another 30 Western and Arab countries - but without Israel or the Palestinians Since that meeting, Fabius tried to push for a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, but this effort also failed to gain traction. In the last few weeks, Fabius and other French officials held talks with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas and other PA officials. The Palestinians expressed support for the creation of an international peace committee to be based on the Arab peace initiative. Fabius' comments on Friday were, in effect, the response to this Palestinian proposal.

News article:
France is looking to quickly revive plans for an international conference to "bring about the two-state solution" to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Friday. "In the coming weeks, France will take... steps in order to organize an international conference gathering each of the parties' principle partners -- principally Americans, Europeans and Arabs -- in order to preserve and to bring about the two-state solution," he said in remarks to diplomats. France has in recent years raised the idea of hosting an international conference to revive peace efforts which would bring in all the key players in a show of support for a final settlement of the decades-long conflict. But the idea has never taken concrete shape. "We must not allow the two-state solution to fall apart," he said, noting that there had been no halt to Israel's settlement activity on land the Palestinians want for a future state. Peace talks collapsed in April 2014 and since then, the situation has deteriorated, with the prospects of fresh dialogue appearing more remote than ever. A wave of Palestinian knife, gun and car-ramming attacks which began on October 1 has killed 25 Israelis, while over the same period, 159 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, most while carrying out attacks although others died in clashes and demonstrations. - Recognizing Palestine? - Should efforts to breathe life into the moribund peace process fail, France would move to unilaterally recognize Palestine as a state, Fabius said. "And what will happen if this last-ditch attempt at reaching a negotiated solution hits a stumbling block?" he said. "In that case, we will have to live up to our responsibilities and recognize a Palestinian state." In November 2014, the French parliament backed a motion urging the government to recognize Palestine as a state as a way of achieving a "definitive resolution of the conflict" in a move which Paris has said could happen if the peace process remained in the doldrums. France has also pushed for a U.N. resolution that would guide negotiations leading to an independent Palestinian state and which could include a timeframe for talks. Until now, France's diplomatic efforts have been largely rebuffed by Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisting that peace would only come through direct negotiations between the parties and not through U.N. resolutions "imposed from the outside." Earlier on Friday, the Palestinians began waging a new campaign at the United Nations to revive peace prospects, with envoy Riyad Mansour highlighting the need for a "collective approach" to solve the conflict and saying a resolution condemning Israel's settlement expansion could be a first step.

News article:
PARIS: France will recognize a Palestinian state if its efforts to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks at an international conference fail, Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Friday. He told French diplomats that the conference will aim to bring together the two parties and their American, European and Arab partners in order “to make happen a two-state solution.” If this attempt faces a deadlock, Fabuis said, France will have to recognize a Palestinian state. France’s Socialist government supports the idea of two states, but had previously argued that it was too early for outright recognition of a Palestinian state. Fabius’ announcement comes as the Palestinians, buoyed by the successful Iran nuclear talks and the start of UN-mediated talks on Syria, have been exploring steps that could lead to a two-state solution including an international conference and a Security Council resolution that would demand an end to illegal Israeli settlement building. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian UN ambassador, told AP: “The Palestinian leadership do welcome the announcement of foreign minister Fabius today in Paris in connection with the convening of an international conference in the next few weeks, and if things fail the recognition of the state of Palestine by France.” “I think the objective of this conference ... has to be to open the process that would lead to the end of the occupation and the preservation of the two-state solution,” he said. As for recognition, Mansour said, “France promised us some time ago that if there is no opening for a meaningful political process — a collective process that would lead to the end of occupation and independence of the state of Palestine and therefore saving the two-state solution soon — then they will recognize the state of Palestine.” He said the Palestinians wanted recognition from France “some time ago,” noting that the French parliament has unanimously recommended recognizing the state of Palestine. “And we hope that they do that,” Mansour said. “If they are tying it to the political process, that is their thinking. But eventually if you believe in a two-state solution, then recognizing the state of Palestine is an investment.” Israel’s UN Mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier on Friday, at UN headquarters in New York, Mansour said the nuclear talks on Iran and talks on Syria, Yemen and Libya have spurred the Palestinians to seek a broader international framework to try to settle the decades-old conflict with Israel. “This is a new culture — and why shouldn’t that spread to the Palestinian issue?,” he asked. Mansour said the Palestinians don’t accept that in 2016 “the door is closed” and nothing can be done to make progress toward a two-state solution because of the US presidential election in November. He said that’s why he has been engaging all 15 members of the Security Council, including Israel’s close ally the US, as well as the UN Secretariat and other “friends,” on their readiness to take steps, especially since virtually all members at the last Mideast meeting spoke out against Israeli settlement building. Mansour commended Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon “for characterizing correctly the settlements as illegal, illegitimate and a major obstacle to peace.” Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Ban’s remarks justify terrorism. Besides a new resolution on settlements and an international conference, Mansour said he has raised the French idea of “a support group” of other countries to promote progress toward peace, an expansion of the Quartet of Mideast mediators — the US, UN, European Union and Russia. He said adoption of a Security Council resolution would be “a signal” that the council and key world powers want to end the conflict and see an independent Palestinian state.

News article:
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday welcomed a French plan to recognize the state of Palestine should a fresh push for peace talks fail, and warned that his people would no longer accept Israel’s occupation or settlements. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius announced Friday that Paris would shortly try to convene an international conference, with the hope of enabling new Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, but that if this effort reached a dead end, Paris would recognize a Palestinian state. Israel immediately rejected the proposal. Speaking at a summit of African nations in Addis Ababa, Abbas blasted the occupation, settlements, and what he said was Israel’s seizure of Palestinian natural resources. He also accused the Israeli government of stalling peace efforts by the international community. “We cannot accept the current situation, including the occupation and settlements,” he said, the Maariv website reported. “We have to establish a sovereign state with East Jerusalem as its capital,” he said, according to the official Palestinian news agency, Wafa. “We won’t accept interim or temporary solutions.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “We won’t return to negotiations just for the sake of negotiating and won’t continue to unilaterally implement previous agreements,” Abbas told the summit. Nor will the Palestinians “accept the theft of our natural resources, and the non-utilization of our lands or investment in them,” he said. “The region will not enjoy security and stability unless the Israeli occupation and settlement activities end,” Abbas continued. “We will stay here on our land and in our homeland, where we have developed our historical and cultural identity and made humanitarian contributions for thousands of years.” Advertisement The Hamas terror group, which rules the Gaza Strip and is a bitter rival of Abbas’ Fatah movement, rejected the French plan as untenable, Ynet said. Senior Hamas official Ismail Radwan said that the calls from the international community to renew peace talks were futile and unacceptable. The world was trying to implement solutions that had previously failed, he said. Meanwhile, leading figures in Israel’s opposition earlier Saturday called the French ultimatum a direct result of the current government’s failed diplomatic policies. “Only an Israeli diplomatic initiative will enable Israel to retain control of its future, and relieve us of the tightening international pressure around our necks,” Zionist Union MK Tzipi Livni said. “As long as there is no initiative on our part, the Palestinians will continue to make gains in the world.” The head of the left-wing Meretz party, Zehava Galon, accused Netanyahu of giving the French “the middle finger” by outright rejecting Fabius’s offer. The government’s rejection of the French ultimatum did receive support, however, from Yesh Atid party leader Yair Lapid, though he blamed Israel’s leadership for having eroded the country’s standing in Europe. Advertisement “Israel will not be coerced into negotiations. We won’t be dragged with threats to the negotiating table,” Lapid said during a cultural event in central Israel on Saturday. “No sovereign nation would accept that.” An unnamed American official also cautiously rejected the French proposal, according to Reuters. “The US position on this issue has been clear. We continue to believe that the preferred path to resolve this conflict is for the parties to reach an agreement on final status issues directly,” the official said. AFP contributed to this report.

News article:
France says it will recognize a Palestinian state if efforts to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict come to nothing. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told a Friday gathering of foreign diplomats that Paris has a responsibility as a permanent member of the UN Security Council to keep up efforts to find a solution between Israel and Palestine. "We cannot let the two-state solution disintegrate. It is our responsibility as a UN Security Council member and a power seeking peace," Fabius said. He noted that France is planning to hold an international conference in the "coming weeks" to bring together the Israeli and Palestinian sides as well as the US and some European and Arab states. If this last attempt at finding a solution ends in a deadlock, "we need to face our responsibilities by recognizing the Palestinian state," Fabius said. Meanwhile, a senior US official said President Barack Obama's administration is aware of the French stance, adding that Washington will not speculate about the proposed conference. "The US position on this issue has been clear. We continue to believe that the preferred path to resolve this conflict is for the parties to reach an agreement on final … issues directly," the official said. People take part in a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris, calling for the recognition of the state of Palestine and a boycott of Israel, October 10, 2015. (AFP) Reacting to the French minister’s remarks, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, welcomed the move. "There is no doubt that a French recognition of the Palestinian state will contribute to building peace and stability in the region," he said. In December 2014, both the French Assembly and Senate adopted resolutions urging Paris to recognize Palestine’s statehood. The Palestinians are seeking to create an independent state on the territories of the West Bank, East al-Quds (Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip, with East al-Quds as the capital. They are also demanding that Israel withdraw from the Palestinian lands occupied in a 1967 war. The Tel Aviv regime, however, has refused to return to the 1967 borders and is unwilling to discuss the issue of al-Quds. In 2012, the United Nations General Assembly voted to upgrade Palestine’s status at the UN from “non-member observer entity” to “non-member observer state” despite strong opposition from the Israeli regime and the US. Palestine's flag was hoisted for the first time at the United Nations headquarters in New York in September last year.

News article:
Some readers of the Israeli press might not be aware, but there are truly two sides to every story or at least two ways of looking at it. Thus one newspaper’s threat is another paper’s peace proposal. One paper’s minor tragedy is another’s story of bravery. Take the French idea (is that term neutral enough?) for a peace summit, with Paris saying it will recognize the State of Palestine should talks fail, which is regarded as an “initiative” in broadsheet Haaretz, but called a “threat” in Yedioth Ahronoth, and a lot worse in Israel Hayom. Haaretz reports that Israel was quick to reject the proposal, but just as quick to backpedal from its blanket rejection. “’This is not how to deal with negotiations and not how you bring about peace,’ said a senior official, yet in the same breath Jerusalem clarified that if and when Israel gets an official invitation from France to take part in the international peace conference, it will study it and make a decision,” the paper writes. Not that an unnamed Israeli official is really needed to telegraph unhappiness in Jerusalem. Yedioth quotes politicians from Likud to Zionist Union raking the dumbkopf idea over the coals. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “They won’t drag us with threats to the negotiating table. Reasonable countries won’t accept this,” Yesh Atid head Yair Lapid is quoted saying, one example of many rejecting the threatposal. With Israeli officials doing all the heavy lifting, one might think Israel Hayom would call it a day and sip a mojito while watching the fireworks. But columnists Dan Margalit and Boaz Bismuth do no such thing, giving Paris a whuppin’ the likes of which it hasn’t seen since the US Congress changed the name of French fries to freedom fries. “[French Foreign Minister Laurent] Fabius can save his confab ideas, invitations to attendees and planning for the festival, though it’s always fun to visit the Eiffel,” Bismuth writes, trying a little reverse psychology on for size. “It would better for the foreign minister to recognize the Palestinian state today and save us all the pro forma song and frustrating dance. The Swedes already did it in 2014, like 70 percent of UN countries. It’s unfortunate, Monsieur Fabius, but even a dramatic step like this is not original.” Advertisement Haaretz’s Barak Ravid takes a less snide shot at Fabius, whom he remarks is neither stupid nor naïve. “The feeling is that the foreign minister brought up the initiative just so it will fail and open the door for him to try different avenues,” he writes, noting that it will likely result in French recognition of Palestine. “If that happens, the final accord of Fabius’s term will turn into his ticket into the annals of French diplomatic history.” With the French apparently off making pastries and unintelligible films instead of pursuing diplomacy until now, peace has in fact remained elusive, as evidenced by yet another stabbing attack on Saturday, this time of a recent American immigrant to Israel. Haaretz makes no mention of the teen’s recent arrival to the country, while Yedioth plays up the sad story of the stabbing as a unique way of welcoming him to the country, after a month and a half here. “I’m never afraid and God willing I want to join up the the IDF’s [elite] Sayeret Matkal [unit],” he’s quoted saying. That quote turns him into the hero of the year in Israel Hayom, where his bandaged back is splayed across the front page, as if none of us was trying to enjoy our Fruity Pebbles here. “They stabbed me – and now I will join up and give everything to the IDF” screams the front page headline in the tabloid, a quote from the unnamed dreamboat. Advertisement “The youth, an ardent Zionist and highly motivated, who a month ago finished immigrating to Israel from New York to join the IDF draft, was stabbed in the attack after finishing prayers at the Western Wall with his brother and friends,” the paper gushes in a two-page spread. Subterranean blues The tabloid and others give a preview on what types of battles the whippersnapper will face once he dons an IDF uniform, where Hamas’s tunnel-digging shovels may replace knives as his adversary. “For hours, I hear nonstop noise. I look around and don’t see anyone building or tearing down a house, and it’s at night, and it makes no sense that while it’s dark out someone should be jackhammering,” one resident living near the Gaza border tells Israel Hayom, which reports that the Defense Ministry says it is doing much to thwart the underground tunneling. In Haaretz, Amos Harel writes that a deadly tunnel collapse in Gaza last week shows that the terror group may be trying to speed up its subterranean work. “The large number of accidents and problems Hamas has run into underground could show that someone in Hamas is in a rush to prepare their offensive tools ahead of a possible decision on an attack. On the Israeli side, last week we saw pictures of intensive efforts to locate such tunnels east of the border with Gaza,” he writes. “It would appear the two sides are in a race against time: Hamas is in a hurry to finish its preparations, while Israel wants to locate the attack tunnels that Hamas may use in the not-so-distant future.” Yedioth is more concerned about what’s happening high in the sky than underground, following up its reporting on a spy scandal showing the US and UK hacked into Israeli drone feeds with a new report claiming that the allies grabbed data from Black Sparrow missiles, which are used as ballistic rocket stand-ins during missile tests. Commentating on the whole affair he is reporting on, Ronen Bergman notes that a reckoning is in place, but the IDF’s excuse that there is no stopping the intelligence gathering of the US and UK, which can grab what they want, is not the way to go about it. “Firstly, Israel has an interest in keeping even nations close to it from knowing about certain operations,” he writes. “But secondly, one cannot discount the ability of certain actors like Hezbollah, or even Iran and Russia.”

News article:
Israel – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on Sunday for a more “sober” approach toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in dismissing a French peace initiative as only encouraging Palestinians to shun compromise. The proposal on Friday by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius for an international peace conference was the latest sign of Western frustration over the absence of movement toward a two-state solution since the collapse of U.S.-brokered negotiations in 2014. Fabius said that if the French plan did not break the deadlock, Paris would recognize a Palestinian state. Such a step would raise concern in Israel that other European countries, also long opposed to its settlement-building in occupied territory, would follow suit. In public remarks to his cabinet, Netanyahu did not explicitly reject the notion of an international conference – an aide said Israel would examine such a request once it was received – but he made clear that reported details of the plan made it a non-starter. Netanyahu said a “threat” to recognize a Palestinian state if France’s peace efforts did not succeed constituted “an incentive to the Palestinians to come along and not compromise”. “I assess that there will be a sobering up regarding this matter,” Netanyahu added. “In any event, we will make effort so that there is a sobering up here, and our position is very clear: We are prepared to enter direct negotiation without preconditions and without dictated terms.” On Saturday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the French proposal, telling an African summit in Ethiopia that “the status quo cannot continue”. But Washington responded with caution to the French move, saying it continued to prefer that Israel and the Palestinians reach an agreement on final-status issues through direct talks. While aware the initiative may struggle to get off the ground, French officials said Paris had a responsibility to act now in the face of ongoing Israeli settlement activity and the prospect of continued diplomatic inaction as the United States focuses on a presidential election in November. And, the officials said, Netanyahu had gone a step too far in accusing U.N. Secretary of State Ban Ki-moon of giving a “tailwind to terrorism” by laying some of the blame for four months of stabbings and car rammings by Palestinians at Israel’s door. Ban angered Israel by saying last week that it is “human nature to react to occupation”. The United States, European Union – Israel’s closest allies – have also issued unusually stern criticism of Israel in recent weeks, reflecting their own frustration with the policies of Netanyahu’s right-wing government. The criticism, particularly about the settlements, where some 550,000 Jews live in around 250 communities scattered across the West Bank and East Jerusalem, has raised Palestinian hopes that world powers might finally be minded to support a U.N. resolution condemning Israel’s policy outright. WEST BANK ATTACK Since October, Palestinian attacks, partly fueled by tensions over the freeze in peace talks, have killed 26 Israelis and a U.S. citizen. In the latest incident, on Sunday, a Palestinian gunman wounded three Israelis near the West Bank settlement of Beit El and was then shot dead by soldiers, the Israeli army said. Palestinian officials said he worked as a bodyguard for a Palestinian prosecutor in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Over the past four months, Israeli forces have killed at least 152 Palestinians, 98 of them assailants according to authorities. Most the others have died in violent protests. “I don’t see anything that warrants living as long as the occupation smothers us and kills our brothers and sisters … You were first and I am following you,” the Beit El assailant, Amjad Abu Omar, wrote on Facebook. Palestinians seek a state in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, parts of which have been occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war. Palestine has non-member observer status at the United Nations and its flag flies with those of member states at UN headquarters in New York. Sweden became the first EU member nation to recognize the Palestinian state in 2014. A total of 136 U.N.-member countries, mostly in Africa, Latin America and Asia, now do so.

News article:
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday welcomed a French initiative aimed at resuming peace talks between Palestinians and Israel. “We welcome the new initiative announced by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius to hold an international conference to resume the peace process and resolve the Palestinian issue based on a two-state solution,” Abbas said at the 26th session of the Assembly of the African Union in Addis Ababa. Abbas stressed the need to hold an international conference devoted to the issue and activate the UN Security Council’s role vis-a-vis the Palestinian national cause. He also urged the international community to end the Israeli occupation through an abiding Security Council resolution and to provide international protection for the Palestinian people. “Peace negotiations must have a time limit and guarantee the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital,” he said. On Friday, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius announced France’s support for an international conference aimed at resuming stalled peace talks. Fabius said that, if the conference ended in failure, France would unilaterally recognize the state of Palestine. (MEMO)

News article:
The same week pitiful images emerged of French President Hollande greeting the fiendish “President” Hassan Rouhani of Iran, France announced it would formally recognize a state of Palestine, should brokered negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians break down. Israel wasted no time issuing a statement about that. “The foreign minister’s statement offers incentive to the Palestinians to reach a deadlock,” an Israeli official said. “It is not possible to conduct negotiations or to achieve peace in such a manner.” This comes a few days after China’s president said essentially the same thing, and some European countries are condemning Israel’s methods in the West Bank, while the EU supports boycotts against Israeli goods. According to the Jerusalem Post, France’s foreign minister outlines the latest colossal blunder regarding diplomacy: “France will engage in the coming weeks in the preparation of an international conference bringing together the parties and their main partners, American, European, Arab, notably to preserve and make happen the two-state solution.” This international conference will commence in the summer. France left no doubt as to its intentions: “If this last attempt at finding a solution hits a wall, ‘well…in this case, we need to face our responsibilities by recognizing the Palestinian state,’ [Foreign Minister Laurent] Fabius said.” Fabius used disturbing language that he is unaware contributes to a climate of anti-Semitism not seen in 70 years: “We see that unfortunately colonization continues and that recently, the Israeli prime minister went so far as to reproach the UN secretary-general for encouraging terrorism on the basis that he had reminded of colonization’s illegality and asked that it cease.” Colonization. That means they believe Israel has stolen Palestinian land. Further, the UN’s Ban Ki-moon is immoral, in his view that the “occupation” gives the Palestinians the right to commit acts of terror. This is a repulsive and grotesque worldview, and one that will eventually condemn the international community. We who study Bible prophecy and who love Israel must never take our eyes off the focus: God’s unfolding plan is rapidly unfolding, and with an international conference about to convene, to condemn Israel and seek to force a Palestinian state, the endgame approaches. Ki-Moon has called Israel’s “settlements” as “provocative acts.” Can you imagine?! These aren’t stupid people, or people ignorant of history. They know Israel has displayed remarkable restraint, and they know Israel has given back 90 percent of the territory taken in the Six-Day War! Which proves they are driven by Jew-hatred. Let’s call it what it is. Now, tragically for those of us who grew up in a great nation, the United States political establishment/regime is also a foe of the Jewish state. Further from the Jerusalem Post: “The United States, European Union and the United Nations have issued unusually stern criticism of Israel, provoking a sharp response from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and raising Palestinians’ hopes of steps against their neighbor.” In part, the international community seeks to throw Israel to the wolves, in hopes the wolves will not come for them. This is also historical folly; all barbarians eventually eat the dupes. History will shame the international community for its role in abandoning Israel. And the God of history will have His reckoning. Reprinted with author’s permission from Rapture Ready

News article:
By Stephen M. Flatow/JNS.org France’s announcement that it will try to convene an international conference to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been strongly criticized by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But before anyone concludes that only “right-wingers” oppose such a conference, it’s worth recalling that one of the most outspoken critics of the conference idea was prominent peace process player Yitzhak Rabin. The year was 1985, and Rabin—later the co-signer of the Oslo Accords with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat—was Israel’s defense minister. Arab leaders had been pushing for the convening of an international peace conference. Rabin and other Israeli leaders were insisting on direct Arab-Israeli negotiations. In the United States, the Ronald Reagan administration had always supported Israel’s position. But in the spring of 1985, reports being appeared in the press suggesting that Secretary of State George Shultz was starting to warm up to the idea of an international conference. A worried Rabin flew to the U.S. for top-level discussions. Upon his arrival in the U.S., Rabin “made it clear he was concerned about Washington’s apparent weakening on the question of an international conference on the Middle East,” according to Near East Report, the weekly newsletter of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories “If they are ready to make peace, let’s negotiate [directly],” Rabin was quoted as saying. “If someone wants to undermine any hope of peace, an international conference and bringing in the Soviets is the best way.” Rabin said that in his meetings with U.S. officials, “I heard about the ‘international umbrella.’” This was a phrase that some administration officials had begun using to try to sugarcoat the bitter pill. “Whenever anyone mention umbrella, it reminds me of Chamberlain and Munich,” Rabin declared. Rabin’s statements were pretty remarkable, when you think about it. He had formerly served as Israel’s ambassador in Washington, so he was keenly sensitive to the need not to anger U.S. officials. Yet he publicly leaked the fact that they were using that deceptive “international umbrella” term. Not only did he leak it, but he openly criticized it, right there in Washington. And not only did he criticize it—but he used the analogy of Chamberlain selling out to Hitler at Munich. For Rabin, of all people, to stand there in Washington and blast the U.S. administration and even invoke a Nazi analogy, was nothing less than astonishing. It really showed what a terrible threat an international conference (or “umbrella”) poses to Israel. Such a conference, if held today, would consist of a dozen or more Arab and European countries ganging up on Israel and demanding that the Israelis make unilateral concessions to the Palestinians. And given the Obama administration’s pro-Palestinian slant, one must assume that the U.S. would side with the Arabs and Europeans. The purpose of the conference would not be to achieve a genuine peace. How do we know? Because the sponsor, France, has already declared that if the conference fails to produce a Palestinian state, then the French will unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state. That’s the goal—not peace, but a Palestinian state, as quickly as possible, no matter the risks to Israel. Which is why the Palestinian Authority’s Inciter in Chief, Mahmoud Abbas, is energetically supporting the conference idea. During the past year, France has suffered the worst terrorist attacks in the world since 9/11. One would think that the French would understand the folly of appeasing Islamic terrorists and why oppose creating what would be an overwhelmingly-Muslim Palestinian terrorist state. Yet just the opposite has happened. Why? Because the French are afraid. They are afraid of angering the Muslim world, afraid of more Muslim terrorism. The French believe that since they are defending themselves against Islamic State—which includes French planes bombing Muslim terrorists in Syria and the French police shutting down pro-terror mosques—they need to prove that they support Muslim causes. Supporting Palestinian statehood is France’s way of trying to appease the Muslim world. The international conference proposal is just another way of throwing Israel under the bus. No wonder the Israelis—Likud or Labor, Netanyahu or Rabin, right or left—aren’t too excited about that prospect. Stephen M. Flatow, an attorney in New Jersey, is the father of Alisa Flatow, who was murdered in an Iranian-sponsored Palestinian terrorist attack in 1995.

News article:
The French proposal for a Palestinian-Israeli conflict resolution is the country's first since the 1967 Six-Day War, when France severed relations with Israel after then-leader Ben Gurion invaded Egypt. According to the French government, the initiative would serve to end the "American monopoly" on hosting the peace process in the region. But, says Talhami, France is now considered to be simply another Western power, along with the US, attempting to announce a major peace initiative to end the longstanding hatred between many Israelis and Palestinians. "Everybody knows that the US is really withdrawing from the Middle Eastern arena. I think we have seen it in Syria where the initiative has been seized by Russia. We have seen that the US worked through surrogates, particularly Turkey," Talhami said. The professor asserts that the Middle East is a region that the US would like to extricate itself from, following the country's many failures, both military and diplomatic. Europeans, facing an enormous immigration from Syria, are concerned that an escalation in the endemic Israel-Palestine violence will result in increased numbers of refugees seeking asylum in Europe, an era-defining event that is "baffling and upsetting for many Europeans." "I don't think for one moment that Europeans will ever act on their own, particularly on the Arab-Israeli arena. I think they probably have been consulted [by the US] and they probably were given some ideas," Talhami suggested. In December 2014 the French parliament took a non-binding vote, recognizing Palestine as an independent sovereign entity, and this contributed to the recent French peace initiative, according to the American professor.

News article:
France’s announcement that it will try to convene an international conference to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been strongly criticized by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But before anyone concludes that only “right-wingers” oppose such a conference, it’s worth recalling that one of the most outspoken critics of the conference idea was prominent peace process player Yitzhak Rabin. The year was 1985, and Rabin—later the co-signer of the Oslo Accords with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat—was Israel’s defense minister. Arab leaders had been pushing for the convening of an international peace conference. Rabin and other Israeli leaders were insisting on direct Arab-Israeli negotiations. In the United States, the Ronald Reagan administration had always supported Israel’s position. But in the spring of 1985, reports appeared in the press suggesting that Secretary of State George Shultz was starting to warm up to the idea of an international conference. A worried Rabin flew to the U.S. for top-level discussions. Upon his arrival in the U.S., Rabin “made it clear he was concerned about Washington’s apparent weakening on the question of an international conference on the Middle East,” according to Near East Report, the weekly newsletter of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). “If they are ready to make peace, let’s negotiate [directly],” Rabin was quoted as saying. “If someone wants to undermine any hope of peace, an international conference and bringing in the Soviets is the best way.” Rabin said that in his meetings with U.S. officials, “I heard about the ‘international umbrella.’” This was a phrase that some administration officials had begun using to try to sugarcoat the bitter pill. “Whenever anyone mentions umbrella, it reminds me of Chamberlain and Munich,” Rabin declared. Rabin’s statements were pretty remarkable, when you think about it. He had formerly served as Israel’s ambassador in Washington, so he was keenly sensitive to the need not to anger U.S. officials. Yet he publicly leaked the fact that they were using that deceptive “international umbrella” term. Not only did he leak it, but he openly criticized it, right there in Washington. And not only did he criticize it—but he used the analogy of Chamberlain selling out to Hitler at Munich. For Rabin, of all people, to stand there in Washington and blast the U.S. administration and even invoke a Nazi analogy, was nothing less than astonishing. It really showed what a terrible threat an international conference (or “umbrella”) poses to Israel. Such a conference, if held today, would consist of a dozen or more Arab and European countries ganging up on Israel and demanding that the Israelis make unilateral concessions to the Palestinians. And given the Obama administration’s pro-Palestinian slant, one must assume that the U.S. would side with the Arabs and Europeans. The purpose of the conference would not be to achieve a genuine peace. How do we know? Because the sponsor, France, has already declared that if the conference fails to produce a Palestinian state, then the French will unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state. That’s the goal—not peace, but a Palestinian state, as quickly as possible, no matter the risks to Israel. Which is why the Palestinian Authority’s Inciter in Chief, Mahmoud Abbas, is energetically supporting the conference idea. During the past year, France has suffered the worst terrorist attacks in the world since 9/11. One would think that the French would understand the folly of appeasing Islamic terrorists and why oppose creating what would be an overwhelmingly Muslim Palestinian terrorist state. Yet just the opposite has happened. Why? Because the French are afraid. They are afraid of angering the Muslim world, afraid of more Muslim terrorism. The French believe that since they are defending themselves against Islamic State—which includes French planes bombing Muslim terrorists in Syria and the French police shutting down pro-terror mosques—they need to prove that they support Muslim causes. Supporting Palestinian statehood is France’s way of trying to appease the Muslim world. The international conference proposal is just another way of throwing Israel under the bus. No wonder the Israelis—Likud or Labor, Netanyahu or Rabin, right or left—aren’t too excited about that prospect. Stephen M. Flatow, an attorney in New Jersey, is the father of Alisa Flatow, who was murdered in an Iranian-sponsored Palestinian terrorist attack in 1995.

News article:
US Secretary of State John Kerry said efforts to revive the stalled Israeli Palestinian peace process need to take a “slightly different” course than they have in the past, but stopped short Wednesday of endorsing a French proposal for a regional peace conference. Kerry also said he saw the justification behind the multilateral confab, backing comments reportedly made by an Israeli general weeks ago that rampant violence over the past month would only get worse without a diplomatic effort on the horizon. Paris’s proposal — to convene two regional peace conferences aimed at advancing the implementation of the two-state solution, and unilateral recognition of Palestinian statehood should the effort fail — is “a reflection of the frustration the international community feels” about the turmoil in the region, the US top diplomat told a hearing on foreign policy at the US House of Representatives. “That why we remain committed to Israel, to Israel’s stability, committed also, however, to move the process forward and bring the parties to the table.” But Kerry said the US was still not ready to support the plan, which Israel opposes, saying Washington was “evaluating it.” “We don’t have all the details,” Kerry said about the French plan. “We’re trying to get some details of what exactly is it trying to achieve and how and what are the rules of the road would be.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Kerry asserted at the hearing that the US government opposed any unilateral steps toward Palestinian statehood. “But what’s happening now is that there’s a multilateral movement that is growing that is concerned about any number of things,” he said. Also in the hearing, Kerry quoted Israel media reports about statements made by IDF military intelligence chief Herzl Halevi, who told a Knesset committee that lack of progress with the Palestinians could lead to more violence. Advertisement “So my hope is everybody will take note of that, not as a threat but as a sense of reality about the downward spiral that comes if there isn’t an active process that is genuine, and I think that requires a slightly different formula than has existed previously,” Halevi said. Twenty-nine Israelis and three foreign nationals have been killed in a wave of Palestinian terrorism and violence since October, during which nearly 170 Palestinians have also been killed, some two-thirds of them while attacking Israelis, and the rest during clashes with troops, according to the Israeli army. Meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah at the same time as Kerry spoke, US President Barack Obama said they discussed ways to reduce the violence via a diplomatic solution. “We continue to agree that it’s important for us to provide both sides a sense of possibility and hope, and not simply despair,” Obama said. Last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the French proposal during a press conference in Berlin. “The French initiative, as it has been published, is questionable,” Netanyahu said in response to a question by The Times of Israel. “There is one way to advance peace – direct negotiations without preconditions between the sides. This is the true way and I think that anyone who tries to deviate from it will not advance successful negotiations.” Advertisement Speaking on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Kerry called on both sides to take measures to signal “readiness and willingness to reduce the violence.” Netanyahu, he said, is currently preparing “some major initiatives with respect to economics” and “security relations” in the West Bank. Kerry, who met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Sunday in Amman, said he has asked him to combat anti-Israel incitement. “We are working very directly with him with respect to any aspects of incitement. I called him on occasion him to encourage him to condemn acts of violence. He has on occasion, but not with consistency, regrettably.” But Kerry also said Israel was at least partially responsible for the moribund peace efforts. “I don’t think the situation is helped by additional settlement construction and building,” he said. “I think that we know we need to see measures taken on both sides to indicate a readiness and willingness to try to proceed forward and reduce the violence.” Joshua Davidovich and AP contributed to this report

News article:
France’s special envoy for its initiative to renew Israeli-Palestinian peace talks will visit Israel next week in an effort to advance plans for a regional peace conference this summer, the French Embassy in Israel announced Thursday. Pierre Vimont, the French Foreign Ministry envoy “for the preparation of the international conference to renew the Middle East peace process,” will arrive in Israel on Sunday for two days of meetings with officials in Ramallah and Tel Aviv. The international summit is scheduled to take place in June or July, over Israeli complaints that peace negotiations should take the form of direct talks. On Wednesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said France will not “automatically” recognize a Palestinian state if the conference does not go ahead, walking back pledges to do so by his predecessor Laurent Fabius, “There is never anything automatic. France will present its initiative to its partners. It will be the first step, there is no prerequisite,” Ayrault said when asked at a press conference in Cairo about Fabius’s remarks. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Ayrault was visiting Egypt to discuss the viability of the French initiative. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had rejected Fabius’s ultimatum as counterproductive, arguing that the confab was doomed to fail since the Palestinians were being told they would gain recognition if no results were achieved. Still, Jerusalem has said it would study the framework for the conference when official invitations are sent out and would carefully weigh its response. Vimont, the French special envoy, this week attended the 5th Extraordinary Islamic Summit on Palestine and Al-Quds (Jerusalem) in the Indonesian capital Jakarta. Advertisement The summit, entitled “Uniting for a Just and Lasting Solution,” was also attended by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. During his Israel trip, Vimont will reportedly will also meet with Arab and international officials to discuss the framework for a meeting that will take place in April to set the agenda for the conference. The April meeting is for an international support group composed of world powers US, Russia, China, France and the UK, as well as the “Arab quartet,” Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Jordan and Egypt. Additionally, Brazil, Japan, Germany, South Africa and India will attend. Neither Israeli or Palestinian officials will attend the meeting in April. Dov Lieber contributed to this report.

Russiaâs Uralvagonzavod company is ready to organize in Iran licensed production of the T-90S gun launcher-armed tanks if restrictions on military-technical cooperation with that country are lifted, the corporationâs deputy director general Alexey Zharich said on Wednesday. Russiaâs main battle gun launcher-armed tank T-90S is equipped with an automated fire control system. It is a light tank (46.5 tons) with a low profile, which increases its survivability. "Cooperation with Iran was suspended in accordance with the presidential decree "On measures to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1020 of June 9, 2010". But if restrictions on military-technical cooperation with Iran are lifted, the corporation together with Rosoboronexport (arms exporting company) is ready to continue cooperation, in particular, on the licensed production of the T-90S tanks, modernization of the T-72S tanks and their production capacities," Zharich said. On Tuesday, Commander of the Iranian Ground Forces Ahmad Reza Pourdastan said the country preferred not to purchase Russiaâs T-90 tanks, but to establish their production in the country.

Iran, Russia Likely to Sign Su-30 Warplane Deal Next Week: Source Posted on by sukhoi-30mki TEHRAN (Tasnim) â Iranâs Defense Minister Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan will probably sign a contract in his forthcoming trip to Moscow on Tehranâs purchase of Russian-made Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets, a Russian source announced Thursday. Sputnik quoted a source in Iranâs Defense Ministry as saying on Thursday that General Dehqan will go to Moscow on February 16 to discuss Russiaâs delivery of S-300 air defense missile system to Iran as well as purchase of Su-30 Flanker multirole jet fighters. âMinister Dehqan is taking a number of the Defense Ministryâs representatives to the Russian capital to meet with their Russian colleagues and other highly-ranked officials,â the source said. During the upcoming meeting, the minister plans to discuss Iranâs need for the Su-30 and sign a contract on its delivery, the report added. âThe last stages will be discussed of delivering Iran the S-300 complex, the first part of which should arrive before the end of next month, and the second by the end of June. Minister Dehqan will also discuss the delivery of Su-30 airplanes because the Defense Ministry believes the Iranian Air Force needs this type of plane. Weâve moved far in these discussions of purchases and I think that during the upcoming visit a contract will be signed,â the source told Sputnik. Iran and Russia in recent years have boosted their cooperation in various defense fields including the supply of military equipment. In the most recent case, Russia started delivering the S-300 missile defense system to Iran in late 2015. Back in October last year, General Dehqan highlighted the significance of defense collaborations between Tehran and Moscow, especially under the current circumstances in the region. âThe current situation necessitates that Iran and Russia, through the political wills of the two countriesâ leaders, develop their cooperation in political, economic, and defense fields,â General Dehqan said at the time.

Moscow to deliver S-300 missile system to Iran in 'nearest time' Iran Press TV Mon Feb 15, 2016 10:44AM Russia will deliver the S-300 surface-to-air missile defense systems to Iran in "the nearest time" as part of a long-running contract between Tehran and Moscow, the country's Foreign Ministry says. "Deliveries will be made soon," Zamir Kabulov of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Asia department told RIA Novosti news agency on Monday. Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan, who arrived in Moscow on Monday, had said on February 10 that Tehran will take delivery of the first batch of the S-300 missile defense systems in the first quarter of 2016, adding that the Islamic Republic will receive the second batch by the first half of 2017. Kabulov also said the Islamic Republic has also shown interest in buying the more advanced S-400 missile systems, but no talks have been held on the matter. "There are no talks being held on the S-400. The Iranians have noted that they would principally be happy [to receive them], but there haven't been any negotiations," he said. Dehqan's trip to Moscow comes at the official invitation of his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu. The officials are scheduled to discuss the latest mutual, regional and international developments, as well as enhanced defense, military and technical cooperation between Tehran and Moscow. Russia committed to delivering the systems to Iran under a USD-800-million deal in 2007. Moscow, however, refused to deliver the systems to Tehran in 2010 under the pretext that the agreement was covered by the fourth round of the United Nations Security Council sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program. The sanctions barred hi-tech weapons sales to Tehran. Following Moscow's refusal to deliver the systems, Iran filed a complaint against the relevant Russian arms firm with the International Court of Arbitration in Geneva. Tehran also developed its domestically-built Bavar-373 air defense system, which was successfully test-fired in August 2014. In April last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin lifted a previous ban on the delivery of S-300 to Iran. In November 2015, Russia signed a new contract to supply Iran with the systems by the end of that year for the first time since the 2010 freeze on supplies under the UN Security Council resolutions. The development came after Iran and the P5+1 states – Russia, China, France, Britain, the US and Germany – reached a landmark agreement, dubbed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), on Tehran's nuclear program in July last year. Under the JCPOA, limits are put on Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for, among other things, the removal of all nuclear-related economic and financial bans against the Islamic Republic.

News article:
In the prospect of intensifying military cooperation between Russia and Iran, Hossein Dehghan, Iranian Minister of Defense arrived to Moscow and instigated deliberations with his peer Sergey Shoygu. Dehghan is also expected to later meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. Moreover, the agreement on Russia delivering the S-300 (missile system) to Iran is in accord on execution, after the deal being previously put to rest, an approximate 10 years, due to the economic and military sanctions that were imposed on Iran. Dehghan visiting Russia aims to acquire artillery bulk worth a near 8 billion dollars in planes and military equipment. He will also be conferring several regional and international suits, like the Syrian crisis and the relationship with Gulf countries especially Saudi Arabia, Military-Technical Cooperation (MTC) sources reported. Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, published that Tehran has provided Moscow a list on arms and equipment the Iranian army hopes on picking up. The list is the same one discussed with the Russian Ministry of Defense, the government, and kremlin. Iran also seems to want to get its hands on the advanced anti-aircraft weapon system S-400, the latest upgrade by the Almaz Central Design Bureau. It is the same missile system Russia has dispatched near Turkish borders north of Syrian Lattakia port city, after the downing of the Russian Sukhoi Su-24 fighter-jet near borders on Nov. 24. Iranian administration potentially looks forward to signing a deal on Sukhoi Su-30 advanced fighter-jets made by Sukhoi Aviation Corporation, or the regulation of a local production of fighter-jets in Iran under Russian licensing, Interfax reported. Sources stated that Russian-Iranian consultations also involve the possibility of importing K-300P Bastion-P Russian mobile coastal defense missile system equipped with Yakhont SS-N-26 anti-ship cruise missile. Iran, moreover, is looking into the chances of bringing in Yak-130 subsonic two-seat advanced jet trainer/light attack aircraft, Mil Mi-8 and Mi-17 helicopters, Russian made frigates, diesel-electric attack submarine, and many other war artillery. Observers in Moscow criticized Tehran’s requisition for being high on expenses and faced with several obstacles. One of the reasons that could stand in the way of Russia realizing each item on that list or some of them is because of the unavailability Iranian liquid assets that are sufficient to finance the deal through a Moscow-provided loan, which in the meantime makes it seem a far-reach possibility. One other reason would be the grave crises Russia now bares due to the sanctions imposed on it since the rupture of the Ukrainian crisis in 2014. Furthermore, the U.N. Security Council has yet not lifted sanctions on sending weapons and military equipment to Iran, which they have stated to remain imposed and according to resolution until year-2020. Moscow already made official statements broadcasted by RIA Novosti, Russia’s international news agency, on Russian interest in settling disputes between Saudi Arabia and Iran, especially in a time when the hitch on oil prices must be solved in a conjoined manner. Zamir Kabulov, Putin’s special envoy for Afghanistan, said that Tehran’s response to the Russian proposal on mediating between Iran and Saudi Arabia was positive. The proposal holds, and Iranian reaction is positive, Kabulov confirmed. Saudi Arabia has yet not responded to the proposition because of compiled tension and discontent present between the two countries’ relationship, according to Kabulov. RIA Novosti pointed out that Russian diplomat Kabulov did not confirm questions on the possibility of the Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei visiting Russia. Controversially he revealed that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov might be paying Iran a visit this year, however, the date of the visit is not set. Despite that Iranian Deputy FM Ibrahim Rahim Bour had before said that Lavrov is expected to visit Iran in the first half of 2016.

News article:
Moscow will deliver the first S-300 air defense system to Iran on Thursday, Iran's General Staff told Russia’s Sputnik news agency. "Tomorrow, Russia will make the first S-300 delivery to Iran," Deputy Chief of Staff Mostafa Izadi said. Earlier, a source told Sputnik that Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan, who arrived in Moscow on February 15, would participate in the delivery ceremony. This month, Hossein Dehghan announced Tehran would get Russian air defense systems by the end of the year, which in Iran ends on March 20, 2016. The initial S-300 deal between Moscow and Tehran was signed in 2007, and envisaged the delivery of five S-300 squadrons, worth over $800 million. In 2010, the contract was put on hold by then-President Dmitry Medvedev due to the UN imposing sanctions on Iran. Tehran hit back, lodging a $4-billion lawsuit at an international court in Geneva against Russia’s Rosoboronexport arms export agency. In April 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin repealed the S-300 delivery ban. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov explained that Moscow’s voluntary embargo on S-300 deliveries was no longer necessary due to the progress in talks on Iran’s nuclear program. In October, Iran’s Defense Ministry confirmed Moscow’s readiness to deliver the S-300 system under an agreement signed between the two countries. Iran has bought Russia’s most well-known air defense systems, its latest S-300PMU-2 Favorite, TASS reported earlier this month during the 2015 Dubai Airshow. Sanctions against Tehran were officially lifted on January 16, after the UN nuclear watchdog confirmed, following a thorough investigation, that Iran had fulfilled all measures required under its deal with six world powers, designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. S-300 systems have been deployed in a number of countries, including Algeria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Cyprus, Kazakhstan and Vietnam. Russia last supplied S-300 systems abroad in 2010, when 15 squadrons were delivered to China. Production of S-300 systems was then suspended as Almaz-Antey, the main producer of Russian air defenses, launched production of the next generation S-400 systems.

Russia has authorized the delivery of S-300 anti-aircraft batteries to Iran, despite the strong opposition of Western powers. Some Russian sources said the system could be delivered as early as Thursday, although the accuracy of the reports was unclear. On November 23, Moscow lifted a ban on the sale and delivery of technological materiel tied to the nuclear industry after a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iran’s leader Hassan Rouhani.

The Thai military wants to purchase more Russian Mil Mi-17V5 transport helicopters in addition to the six aircraft the country has already acquired, according to a source in the Russian defense industry quoted by Sputnik. The aircraft (NATO code name “Hip”) is manufactured by Russian helicopters’ subsidiary in Kazan and is the latest version of the Mi-17 line of helicopters. Last September the company said it was trying to gain market share in the Asia-Pacific region by boosting after-sales and support services with local partners. Russian Helicopters has increased regional sales and industrial collaboration with partners in India, China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Bangladesh. Over 900 civil and military aircraft produced in Russia are operating in the Asia-Pacific region, according to the company’s deputy general director Alexander Shcherbinin. “This is the reliable operational base for developing regional support centers,” he told RIA Novosti. The contract for the first batch of Thai Mi-17s was agreed in September 2015. The Russian trade minister said the country was prepared to barter over $160 million worth of arms in exchange for 80,000 tons of Thai rubber. This was the first time the Thai military chose a Russian aircraft over those produced in the United States.

"Tomorrow, Russia will make the first S-300 delivery to Iran," Deputy Chief of Staff Mostafa Izadi said Earlier, a source told Sputnik that Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan, who arrived in Moscow on February 15, would participate in the delivery ceremony.This month, Hossein Dehghan announced Tehran would get Russian air defense systems by the end of the year, which in Iran ends on March 20, 2016.The initial S-300 deal between Moscow and Tehran was signed in 2007, and envisaged the delivery of five S-300 squadrons, worth over $800 million. In 2010, the contract was put on hold by then-President Dmitry Medvedev due to the UN imposing sanctions on Iran. Tehran hit back, lodging a $4-billion lawsuit at an international court in Geneva against Russia's Rosoboronexport arms export agency.Iran has bought Russia's most well-known air defense systems, its latest S-300PMU-2 Favorite, TASS reported earlier this month during the 2015 Dubai Airshow.Sanctions against Tehran were officially lifted on January 16, after the UN nuclear watchdog confirmed, following a thorough investigation, that Iran had fulfilled all measures required under its deal with six world powers, designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.S-300 systems have been deployed in a number of countries, including Algeria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Cyprus, Kazakhstan and Vietnam. Russia last supplied S-300 systems abroad in 2010, when 15 squadrons were delivered to China. Production of S-300 systems was then suspended as Almaz-Antey, the main producer of Russian air defenses, launched production of the next generation S-400 systems.Earlier this week, Russia's Kommersant daily reported , citing unnamed sources, that Iran is also interested in buying Sukhoi Su-30SM fighters, the Mil Mi-8 and the Mil Mi-17 helicopters from Russia, along with other weapons.This month an adviser to Iran's supreme leader said Tehran plans to buy more Russian-made military hardware. "Iran is willing to buy additional amounts [of weapons] from Russia, and the Russian government also wants to positively respond to such requests," Ali Akbar Velayati, adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said during his four-day visit to Moscow in February, according to RIA Novosti.

Iran, Russia Negotiating 'Next Generation' S-300 Missile Systems' Supplies Sputnik News 21:27 22.02.2016 Iran is discussing with Russia military supplies, including S-300 'new generation' missile systems, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Ansari-Jaberi said. Earlier, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu paid an official visit to Tehran to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and the Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehghani. Representatives of both countries discussed, among others, the sale of S-300 missile systems, Iranian news agency IRNA reported. 'Iran is negotiating with Russia its military needs, including new generation S-300 missile systems,' Ansari-Jaberi commented on the visit of the Russian side, cited by IRNA. In 2007, Russia and Iran signed a contract for the supply of S-300 missile systems at a total cost of about $900 million. In 2010, in the context of UN Security Council resolution on the limitation of arms supplies to Iran amid its nuclear activities, Russia imposed an embargo on weapons sales to the country. However, in April 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree that provides for lifting the ban on the supply of these complexes to Iran amid the progress reached during negotiations on the Iranian nuclear program. It was announced in summer 2015 that Moscow and Tehran are preparing a contract for the supply of S-300 missile systems. At the same time, the S-300 system was said to have undergone changes that have improved its tactical and technical characteristics. The contract entered into force in November 2015.

News article:
Tehran, Iran, March 8 By Mehdi Sepahvand - Trend: An Iranian military official has said that there is no obstacle to hinder the delivery of Russia's S-300 defense missile system to the country. "The clear news about the case is that Iran and Russia have reached the agreements needed to do the job and as we speak there is no problem for conveying the S-300 missiles," Masoud Jazayeri, second-in-command of Iran's General Staff of Armed Forces said. "I think the job will be done in the near future," he noted, Tasnim news agency reported March 8. Some Israeli news outlets last week said Russia had been discouraged from delivering the missiles to Iran. After Israel gave Russian President Vladimir Putin intelligence proving that weapons Russia sold to Iran were ending up in the hands of Lebanon's Hezbollah, Putin froze the transfer of S-300 surface-to-air missile systems to Tehran, Breaking Israel News quoted Kuwaiti newspaper Al Jarida as reporting March 5. Jazayeri further explained that Iran and Russia's general agreements regarding the missiles are now to be transformed into minor, executive agreements in order to become practical. The $800-million contract to deliver S-300 to Iran was cancelled in 2010 by then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, falling in line with the UN sanctions imposed on Iran due to its disputed nuclear program. In turn, Tehran filed a currently pending $4 billion lawsuit against Russia in Geneva's arbitration court. However, Russia President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to lift the ban over delivering the long-overdue missile system to Iran in April 2015.

News article:
Nearly two months after finding the body of Italian researcher Giulio Regeni dumped on a desert road, bearing signs of torture, and amid international pressure to find the murderers, Egyptian authorities claimed Thursday to have uncovered, and killed, Regeni’s killers. The Ministry of Interior announced Thursday night that it found belongings of the Cambridge University PhD student in an apartment in Qalyubia, near the capital. “A red handbag was found, including a brown wallet, the passport of Regeni , his Cambridge University ID card, and a visa card,” an official ministry statement said. The ministry also said that the bag included other things such as another wallet, a sum of $563, three sunglasses and a female wrist watch. “Brownish stuff was also found, looking like hashish – a form of cannabis drug,” the statement added. Earlier on Thursday afternoon, a statement released by the ministry said that security forces “succeeded in targeting” a criminal gang near New Cairo area; which specialised in “impersonating policemen” for purposes of kidnapping and robbing foreigners living in Egypt. In fact, the ministry said it killed all fiour members of the gang, whom had engaged in a gunfire exchange with the police during their arrest. Local media reports – including state media – then quoted ‘anonymous’ security sources claiming the gang could potentially be linked to the murder of Regeni. Then, they reported that the prosecution general authorities denied such ties, until the ministry’s latest revelation late Thursday night. In a detailed statement published by the ministry on its official Facebook page, it identified the killed suspects. The first was Tarek Abdel Fattah, 52 years old, along with his 26-year-old son Saad Abdel Fattah. The two others were Mostafa Bakr, 60, and Salah Ali, 40. The ministry claimed the suspects were registered as highly dangerous criminal and wanted in different cases. The police said the men were driving a minibus as they neared a security checkpoint, opening fire on security forces. “A fifth body, unidentified, was found in the minibus,” the ministry stated, in addition to an automatic rifle, a gun and an electric shock, and forged police cards carrying the badge of the Interior Ministry. After that, the police reportedly raided the apartment of the first suspect’s sister, where they also found his wife. The ministry said the sister confessed to her brother’s crimes, and after searching the apartment, they found the belongings of Regeni, and others, which she also admitted were stolen by her brother. According to them, the gang was responsible for the robbery of more than $20,000 from nine Egyptians and foreign citizens, including an Italian citizen named David K. and a Portuguese citizen named Carlos M. Police said they also found “brownish stuff looking like drugs” in handbag. At the end of the statement, the ministry thanked the Italian investigative delegation working on Regeni’s case in Egypt for “its efforts and cooperation.” Regeni, 28, was found dead in a ditch along the Cairo-Alexandria Desert Road on 3 February, nine days after his disappearance, amid allegations of possible security involvement due to his research related to Egypt’s labour and connections to workers’ unions and members of the Egyptian opposition. In an interview with Italian daily La Repubblica in mid-March, President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi addressed the family of the Italian PhD candidate “as a father before a president” who will “spare no effort” to find the perpetrators. Italy widely denounced the killing of Regeni, demanding prompt and transparent investigations and the perpetuators to be held accountable. A delegation had arrived to Cairo to follow on the case closely, but their work seemed to have been limited to being informed of the latest updates by Egyptian counterparts. The ministry’s findings have raised sarcasm among social media users who were suspicious of the ministry’s claims. Journalist Mohamed El-Garhy raised a few questions concerning the ministry’s statement, in which he wondered why the ‘wanted criminals’ have not been caught earlier, and how they ‘were freely wandering around with a dead body inside their car.’ Furthermore, the police said the crimes the gang – including the nine robberies – were registered at the police stations of Nasr City and New Cairo, “which are far from Dokki district, where Regeni was believed to have been last before his disappearance,” El-Garhy commented. There have been no official comment from Italy so far, but the international community, especially the EU Parliament, said it was closely watching Egypt’s work on the case. By Amira El-Fekki

Italy rejects Egypt's claim to have found student's killers By Steve Scherer and Isla Binnie ROME, March 25 (Reuters) - Italy rejected on Friday Egypt's claim that it had identified the killers of an Italian graduate student whose tortured body was recovered last month, and Rome vowed to press on with its own murder investigation. The broken body of Giulio Regeni, 28, was found on the outskirts of Cairo. Human rights groups have said the signs of torture indicated the 28-year-old had been killed by Egyptian security forces, an allegation Cairo has vigorously denied. Regeni had written articles critical of the Egyptian government. On Thursday Egyptian authorities said a criminal gang that had been killed in a shootout had had Regeni's bag and passport in its possession - a statement that failed to convince Rome investigators, Italian politicians and also Regeni's family. "We are wounded and embittered by the latest attempt by Egyptian authorities to throw off track (the investigation) into the barbaric killing of our son, Giulio," the newspaper La Reppublica quoted the parents as saying in a statement. Rome's chief prosecutor, Giuseppe Pignatone, said the investigation into Regeni's murder would continue. The evidence so far shared with a team of Italian investigators in Cairo "is not adequate in clarifying the death of Giulio Regeni and in identifying those responsible for the homicide", he said in a statement. Pignatone called on Egyptian investigators to provide the seven-member Italian team sent to Cairo almost two months ago with all the evidence they have requested. "Italy insists: we want the truth," Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said in a tweet. The case has caused friction between Egypt and Italy, though it looks unlikely to drive a permanent wedge between them because of the two countries' economic ties and Egypt's strategic role in the Middle East. "I don't believe at all the 'truth' coming from the Egyptian authorities about Regeni's death," Giacomo Stucchi, president of Italy's parliamentary secret service committee, said in a tweet.

News article:
Egypt's Interior Ministry said Thursday it has killed members of a gang suspected of being linked to the killing of an Italian student whose torture and death sparked an international outcry over possible involvement of Egyptian police in his brutal killing. In a statement, the ministry said the gang members are specialized in abducting foreigners while posing as policemen, and found the personal belongings of the 28-year-old Giulio Regeni. In an exchange of gunfire, the four men were killed inside their vehicle in an eastern Cairo suburb, the ministry statement said. It added that the group is suspected of orchestrating the kidnapping of foreigners and robbery. A body was found inside the group's vehicle next to weapons and forged police identification cards. Ahmed Nagy, a state prosecutor investigating the Regeni case, told The Associated Press he has no information on the gang. He stressed, "there are no suspects," in the case. Last week, Egypt's Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi promised that investigators would work "night and day" to locate and prosecute those responsible for Regeni's killing. Regeni went missing on Jan. 25, the fifth anniversary of Egypt's 2011 uprising, when police were deployed across Cairo in a broad security sweep to prevent any demonstrations. In the statement, the ministry said that police raided one of the men's houses and found the personal belongings of Regeni, including his red handbag bearing the picture of the Italian flag, his passport and other identification cards, including one belonging to Cambridge University, in addition to his cellphones. The ministry posted pictures of Regeni's credit card, passport, and other IDs. It added that the Egyptian authorities have notified their Italian counterparts and expressed their appreciation for the Italians' cooperation. Italian officials have repeatedly complained about a lack of transparency from Cairo amid media speculation that Regeni might have been a victim of the widespread torture and secret detentions by police that have been denounced by rights groups. Regeni had been in Egypt since September conducting research on workers and labor rights a sensitive topic, since disgruntled workers were among the forces in the 2011 anti-Mubarak uprising and authorities still worry about worker discontent. Regeni was last seen on Jan. 25 heading from his apartment to meet a friend in downtown Cairo. He was on his way to the subway, which was packed with security personnel scanning bags and checking commuters' IDs.In the days following his disappearance, friends and colleagues launched a search, circulating Regeni's picture widely on social media. His body was found nine days later in an empty lot along a highway in the 6th of October suburb on Cairo's western outskirts. Nagi said earlier that Regeni's body carried marks of torture. "All of his body, including his face" had bruises, cuts from stabbings and burns from cigarettes, Nagi said, adding Regeni appeared to have suffered a "slow death." News of the slaying and evidence of torture spurred diplomatic tensions. An Italian government delegation cut short a visit to Cairo and Italy summoned the Egyptian ambassador in Rome, calling for a full investigation with participation by Italian experts. Egyptian media accused "evil hands" of orchestrating Regeni's killing to damage Egyptian-Italian relations. The term is usually used to refer to those who have been targeted by a ferocious crackdown since the 2013 military ouster of country's first democratically elected President Mohammed Morsi. The Italian media pointed fingers at the Egyptian security forces. A business daily, Il Sole 24 Ore, said "the strong suspicion" was that Regeni was "killed by Egypt ... by the system, by the security apparatus." Egyptian officials deny any police involvement. For years, rights groups have accused Egyptian police of regularly torturing detainees. Over the past year, they have also accused them of using "forced disappearances" detaining suspected activists in secret without reporting their arrest. shortlink copied KEYWORDS world

News article:
Cairo: An Egyptian delegation is to travel to Italy to present the results of Egypt’s investigation into the torture and death of an Italian researcher in Cairo, the state prosecutor general said on Tuesday. The visit comes amid mounting pressure on Egypt to reveal the circumstances that led to the brutal death of Guilio Regeni, a 28-year-old researcher abducted on a Cairo street on January 25, the day Egyptians marked the fifth anniversary of the uprising that ousted autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Regeni’s brutally tortured body was found nine days later by the side of a road in a Cairo suburb. Prosecutor-General Nabeel Sadek said the Egyptian delegation, which will leave for Italy on Wednesday, will be led by his assistant, Judge Mustafa Sulaiman. Italian news agency ANSA reported on Monday that the delegation will also include another prosecutor and three security officers. Weeks after Regeni’s body was found, authorities linked the killing to a criminal gang, saying they found the Italian student’s personal belongings in a suspect’s home after a shootout that killed all the gang’s members. Regeni’s parents said the Egyptian explanation of their son’s death rang hollow and have pressed the Italian government to step up pressure on Cairo by declaring Egypt to be an “unsafe” country for Italian tourists. Meanwhile, Italian prosecutors are waiting for Egyptian investigators to hand over data from Regeni’s cellphone and video from surveillance cameras from the subway station area where he was last seen. An Egyptian security official said there was a conflict between the security and judicial agencies on who is to lead the team to Italy and what to present to the Italians. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to discuss the case, said that the prosecutors were concerned security agencies attempted to “keep information” and not present it to the Italian side. Security expert Khalid Okasha said on Tuesday that if Egypt brings no news to the Italians, relations between the two countries will enter “a dark tunnel”.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to discuss the case, said that the prosecutors were concerned security agencies attempted to “keep information” and not present it to the Italian side. Security expert Khalid Okasha said on Tuesday that if Egypt brings no news to the Italians, relations between the two countries will enter “a dark tunnel”.

News article:
Italy warns Egypt it expects truth about death of student ROME (AP) — Italy warned Tuesday that it is prepared to take "immediate and proportional measures" against Egypt if it fails to come clean with all it knows about the torture and death of an Italian graduate student in Cairo. Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni told the Senate that meetings this week in Rome between Italian and Egyptian prosecutors could be "decisive" to filling in gaps in the investigation of the death of Giulio Regeni. The 28-year-old researcher was abducted on a Cairo street Jan. 25, when police were out in force as Egyptians marked the fifth anniversary of the uprising that ousted autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Speculation mounted that Egypt's security forces were involved after Regeni's brutally tortured body was found nine days later. FILE -- In this Tuesday, March 29, 2016 file photo, Paola, the mother of Giulio Regeni, center, flanked by lawyer Alessandra Ballerini, left, and by senator Luigi Manconi attend a press conference at the Italian Senate, in Rome. The editor of Egypt's top state newspaper called on Egyptian authorities Sunday, April 3, 2016, to seriously deal with the case of an Italian student tortured and killed in Cairo, saying officials who didn't realize the gravity of the case are risking Egyptian-Italian relations. Italian Premier Matteo Renzi has insisted Italy will settle for nothing less than the truth. (AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia, File) Gentiloni repeated Italian criticism that Egyptian authorities hadn't provided full information to date, saying Italian prosecutors in particular wanted missing documentation concerning Regeni's cellphone use and closed-circuit video footage of the Cairo area from where he was believed snatched. "If there isn't a change, the government is ready to react by adopting immediate and proportional measures," Gentiloni warned. He didn't specify possible measures, but Regeni's parents have urged Italy to declare Egypt an "unsafe" country for Italian tourists. In Cairo, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid said Gentiloni's comments "complicate matters further," given that they were made one day before the Egyptian team of prosecutors and police arrives in Italy to share the results of the Egyptian investigation with Rome investigators. Also in Cairo on Tuesday, President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said his country deeply regretted Regini's death and intended to "transparently" continue its "full cooperation" with Italy to resolve the case and bring the culprits to justice. El-Sissi and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi have forged close ties since the Egyptian leader came to office in June 2014. Italy is Egypt's biggest EU trading partner and the two countries have been coordinating policies on Libya, Egypt's neighbor and Italy's former colony where the extremist Islamic State group has a local affiliate. "Close Italian-Egyptian relations, which stretch across history, are able to wisely deal with and get through such isolated incidents without creating negative consequences ...," presidential spokesman Alaa Youssef quoted el-Sissi as telling a visiting delegation from NATO's parliamentary assembly. An Egyptian security official said there was a conflict between the security and judicial agencies on who would lead the team and what to present to the Italians. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case, told The Associated Press that prosecutors were concerned that the security agencies had attempted to "keep information" and not present it to the Italian side. Weeks after Regeni's body was found, Egyptian authorities linked the killing to a criminal gang, saying they found the Italian student's personal belongings in a suspect's home after a shootout that killed all the gang's members. But Italian media immediately dismissed the claim and even Egypt's top state newspaper criticized the "naive stories" being offered about the death and urged Egyptian authorities to deal seriously with the case. ___ AP reporters Hamza Hendawi, Maggie Michael and Sam Magdy contributed from Cairo. ___ This story has been corrected to show el-Sissi said "wisely," not "widely" in quote about relations between Italy and Egypt.

News article:
Egypt handed Italian authorities on Thursday a 2,000-page report with testimonies from 200 people regarding the probe over the torture and death in Egypt of Italian PhD student Giulio Regeni, official Italian news agency ANSA reported. Regeni, who was in Cairo conducting research on independent trade unions, went missing on 25 January. His body was found bearing signs of torture on a roadside on the outskirts of Cairo on 3 February. The report presented to Italy includes "evidentiary material" that Italian authorities had requested several weeks ago, including video footage, phone records and medical reports. It is not yet clear whether Italian authorities will find the documents presented by Egypt to be satisfactory, as Italian investigators had previously said that they find “inconsistencies” in Egypt’s account of Regeni’s death. These doubts were expressed by Italian officials after the Egyptian interior ministry said that Regeni’s belongings, including his passport, were found in possession of an alleged gang of kidnappers whom the ministry says was targeting foreigners for robbery. The four alleged gang members were killed in a shootout with police before the documents were found in a Cairo apartment used by the gang, according to the ministry. ANSA reported that Italian investigators may request information on whether or not Regeni was under surveillance prior to his abduction, especially during his meetings with independent unions. The Egyptian and Italian officials are expected to discuss Regeni's case for two days starting Thursday. The meetings are being held at a police academy in Rome and attended by Italian top prosecutor Giuseppe Pignatone and three other Italian officials. The Egyptian delegation is made up of five officials – two judges and three police officers – headed by Mustafa Soliman, the assistant to the Egyptian prosecutor-general. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
It is as if Giulio Regeni was crucified for us all, but instead of taking away our sins, he exposed the sins of Egypt's and the world's ruling elites. We may be unsure whether it is Egyptian security personnel who tortured and murdered him. We might never know, ever - simply because corrupt elites do not allow for transparency and the availability of information. But we do know he went missing on the fifth anniversary of the January 25 Uprising when Egyptian security apparatuses were on top alert, guarding the streets against any possible attempt at a commemoration of the 2011 Revolution in the public sphere. Regeni disappeared from the street on a day Cairo was littered with security personnel. Be the details surrounding Regeni's death as they may, he is still our messiah with his murder getting the world talking about so many other violations that we are sure happened at the hands of Egyptian security personnel: The 533 enforced disappearance cases that occurred in Egypt in the past eight months and the 396 cases that are still unaccounted for, according to Italy's Corriere Della Serra newspaper. The extrajudicial killings, including the killing of the five men whom the interior ministry scapegoated under the pretext that they were gangsters who allegedly killed Regeni. The extended pre-trial detention. The torture of detainees and suspects. The hundreds who got killed for a protest camp to be dispersed, and the 37 who were tear-gassed to death inside a small police truck on one of Cairo's hot summer days. Advertisement Regeni got the world asking with us questions that they had deliberately or obliviously ignored before his death: What happened to the Italian student who went missing in Cairo after heading for the metro station? How about the Egyptian video editor who went to buy food and never returned (Mostafa Massouny is his name and it has been eight months)? Where is the engineering student who was taken from outside his college and never showed up again? Where are the others? And why has Italy, Egypt's significant trading partner and good friend, never threatened to take "immediate" measures against the Egyptian government for their sake? He exposed the hypocrisy of Western politicians who remained silent about cases of torture and enforced disappearance for more than two years; then they spoke out only when an Italian led a similar fate. What is the value of the trade and investment deals that Italy and other Western countries have stuck with Egypt? More valuable than the lives, safety and freedoms of innocents? More questions that Regeni forced us to ask. Regeni revived solidarity among people who reject injustice and oppression. We learnt in the early months of 2011 that the secret to ordinary people's triumph over tyrants is the moment they realize that they are united for one cause - then they become no longer ordinary. Advertisement And here we are reckoning that Regeni's enforced disappearance, torture and murder constitute "non è caso isolato" (no isolated case), as Regeni's mother Paola Regeni said in a press conference in late March. Her son has become an icon just like Khaled Said, who was 28 like Regeni and who was tortured to death at the hands of Egyptian policemen in 2010. A Facebook page set up in his memory called for the January protests of 2011, united Egyptians, and sparked a revolution. Paola has become "a mother of a martyr" like Khaled Said's mother and like many mothers of "martyrs" whom we honor - because her son was "killed like an Egyptian." While an Egyptian official delegation is now in Rome to present Cairo's findings regarding Regeni's case, many Egyptians are in a state of confusion and uncertainty. Naturally, the Egyptian interior ministry has, for long, had little or no credibility, since even before Khaled Said's case. But at the same time, many of the Egyptians who do not believe the Egyptian interior ministry's narrative do not see the Italian official position as particularly credible either. Rome showed pragmatic support for the Egyptian government in the past few years, a support that continued unabated notwithstanding the Egyptian authorities' violations against dissident voices. Even after Regeni's murder, the Italian government started off with a weak reaction to the Italian student's disappearance and the Egyptian police's failure to unravel it; then their stance intensified later, prompting many to conclude that the Italian government started to give more attention to its citizen's murder only when pressure on it mounted at home. This called into question the genuineness of the Italian government's appreciation of Regeni's life and of human rights general. Advertisement

News article:
Egypt says it hadn't been notified officially about the recall Italy recalled its ambassador to Egypt for consultations on Friday after two days of meetings between Italian and Egyptian investigators over the murder of an Italian PhD student whose body was found in Cairo in February. Egyptian foreign ministry's spokesman, Ahmed Abu Zeid, said the ministry hadn't been notified officially about the recall, and did not know the reasons for the decision, "particularly as no statement has been issued yet regarding the results of the meeting between the Egyptian and Italian investigation teams looking into the case of the murder of Italian student Giulio Regeni." An Egyptian delegation headed to Rome on Wednesday to submit a 2000-page report to chief prosecutor Giuseppe Pignatone on Cairo's investigation into the killing of Regeni. Abu Zeid added the ministry is awaiting the return of the Egyptian team to Cairo to hear their evaluation about the results of the meetings, and what the Italian side would announce on the aftermath of the meetings being conducted in Rome for the last couple of days. Following the recalling of ambassador Maurizio Massari, the Italian foreign ministry said the decision was made to allow for "an urgent evaluation" of what steps to take to "ascertain the truth about the barbaric murder of Giulio Regeni", according to a statement. "Italy will stop only when it has the truth," Italian Prime Minister Renzi said on Facebook after the ambassador was recalled. The 28-year-old Regeni vanished from the streets of Cairo on 25 January. His body was discovered in a ditch on the outskirts of the Cairo nine days later, showing signs of extensive torture. Given the sensitive topic of Regeni's research – independent trade unions – his disappearance was quickly considered by some to be an instance of abduction by government agents, who human rights advocates blame for other cases of forced disappearance. However, the interior ministry strongly denied any link with Regeni's death. Last month Egyptian police said they had found the Italian's passport and other belongings in the possession of one of the families of a member of an alleged gang of kidnappers who robbed foreigners. Police killed all four members of the alleged gang in a shoot out in late March. Many Italian officials have publicly expressed scepticism towards the transparency of Cairo's investigation.

News article:
Cairo: Tensions between Italy and Egypt over the torture and death of an Italian graduate student in Cairo this year touched a new high on Friday, when Italy announced that it was withdrawing its ambassador to Egypt for urgent consultations to protest what it called a lack of cooperation in the joint investigation between the two nations. Italy’s foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni, announced the move at the end of two days of talks in Rome between Egyptian and Italian investigators over the death of Giulio Regeni, 28, whose brutalised body was discovered beside a highway on the edge of Cairo on Febrary 3. In particular, Italian officials wanted cellphone data and surveillance footage that could help determine the precise circumstances of Regeni’s disappearance on January 25. But that assistance did not materialise in recent days, Italian officials said. In a statement, Gentiloni said he was recalling Ambassador Maurizio Massari for an “urgent evaluation” of efforts to resolve what he termed a “barbaric murder”. The gesture falls short of a full withdrawal of the ambassador and will not entail closing Italy’s embassy in Cairo. In Cairo, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ahmad Abu Zaid, said the government had not been formally informed of the Italian decision and would await the return of the Egyptian investigators from Rome before taking further steps. Regeni’s killing has dominated the media in Italy for weeks, and public anger there has been driven by accounts of the injuries he suffered before his death. His body was found with cigarette burns, broken bones and signs that he had been beaten on the feet. Sharp questions arose over Egyptian attempts to link Regeni’s death to five men who the police said were members of a criminal gang that had been kidnapping foreigners. The men were shot dead at a police checkpoint on March 24. An emotional media appearance last month by Paola Regeni, the student’s mother, increased pressure on the Italian government to take a tough stance. She threatened to publish a photograph of her son’s battered body unless the Egyptian investigation made substantial progress. Italy wants other European countries to pressure Egypt on the Regeni investigation. But a united European front on the case may be complicated by competing economic and strategic interests. The president of France, Francois Hollande, is scheduled to arrive in Cairo on April 18 for a four-day visit during which the two countries are expected to sign a $1.1 billion (Dh4.04 billion) weapons deal.

News article:
Two Egyptian experts say that Italy may bring the high-profile case of an Italian doctoral student who was found murdered in Cairo before the European Parliament with a view to having sanctions imposed on Egypt. Egyptian legal researcher Ahmed Mefreh said the Giulio Regeni murder case could lead to Egyptian individuals suspected of involvement being summoned by Interpol and official complaints against the Egyptian regime being submitted to international bodies. According to the Italian embassy in Cairo, Regeni, 28, came to Cairo last September to work on his doctoral thesis on the Egyptian economy. He disappeared on Jan. 25 in Cairo’s Dokki district before his body was found -- bearing signs of torture -- several days later. Speaking to Anadolu Agency, Mefreh said Italy’s recent decision to recall its ambassador in Cairo was proof that negotiations with Egypt -- which took place on Thursday and Friday -- had failed. "Italian investigation authorities have two options. The first is to continue investigations and submit the information they have to the Italian judiciary," Mefreh said. The second option, according to Mefreh, would be "to halt the investigation until new information emerges". In the latter case, he said, Italian investigators would provide all information currently at their disposal -- both what they have learned through the media and what has been found by Italian investigators who visited Egypt -- to the Italian judiciary. "This would give the Italian authorities the right to widen the circle of suspicion to include more suspects, with the possibility of eventually proving them guilty," said Mefreh. "In this case, the Italian judiciary could file a request to have these suspects detained." If the Egyptian government failed to surrender the accused individuals to the Italian authorities, Mefreh added, the latter could bring the case before the European Union and Interpol. - 'Lockerbie scenario' Said Sadek, a political sociology professor at the American University in Cairo, told Anadolu Agency that Egypt could -- in the event that it failed to surrender the suspects -- end up with a "Lockerbie scenario". The Lockerbie case involved a U.S. passenger plane that went down over the Scottish village of Lockerbie in 1988. Three years later, an arrest order was issued in the U.S. and Britain for two Libyans suspected of bombing the plane. Libya, however, refused the request and launched its own investigation, detaining the two suspects and asking both countries to provide what evidence it had against them. The case ultimately ended up with sanctions being imposed on Libya. "Italy’s decision to recall its ambassador in Cairo is a diplomatic escalation intended to express displeasure about the lack of progress in the Egyptian investigation and appease Italian public opinion -- and also to put pressure on Egypt," Sadek said. "It could eventually lead to diplomatic relations being cut." A second scenario is that the case may be raised at the European Parliament, after which foreign ministers from EU member states could impose sanctions on Egypt. On March 9, the European Parliament issued an urgent statement in which it advised member states to cut aid to Egypt due to perceived Egyptian stonewalling in the Regeni case. - Envoy recalled On Saturday, Italy officially notified Egypt that it had recalled its ambassador for "consultations", an Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman said. According to a statement issued by the Italian Foreign Ministry, Ambassador Maurizio Massari was summoned to Rome to discuss the Regeni case.

Italy’s official ANSA news agency reported that Italian officials had found information provided by the Egyptian authorities to be "insufficient" and that the Italian side had left the meeting dissatisfied. Regeni vanished on Jan. 25 -- the fifth anniversary of a popular uprising that forced autocratic President Hosni Mubarak to step down after 30 years in power. At the time of Regeni’s disappearance, Egypt's sprawling security apparatus had been on high alert to prevent the eruption of any demonstrations marking the anniversary. On Feb. 3, the student’s dead body -- bearing signs of extreme abuse and torture -- was found in a ditch on Cairo’s outskirts. While the Egyptian authorities deny any involvement, informed observers say the signs of torture on the young man’s body were similar to those associated with Egyptian police torture.

News article:
Two Egyptian experts say that Italy may bring the high-profile case of an Italian doctoral student who was found murdered in Cairo before the European Parliament with a view to having sanctions imposed on Egypt. Egyptian legal researcher Ahmed Mefreh said the Giulio Regeni murder case could lead to Egyptian individuals suspected of involvement being summoned by Interpol and official complaints against the Egyptian regime being submitted to international bodies. According to the Italian embassy in Cairo, Regeni, 28, came to Cairo last September to work on his doctoral thesis on the Egyptian economy. He disappeared on Jan. 25 in Cairo’s Dokki district before his body was found -- bearing signs of torture -- several days later. Speaking to Anadolu Agency, Mefreh said Italy’s recent decision to recall its ambassador in Cairo was proof that negotiations with Egypt -- which took place on Thursday and Friday -- had failed. "Italian investigation authorities have two options. The first is to continue investigations and submit the information they have to the Italian judiciary," Mefreh said. The second option, according to Mefreh, would be "to halt the investigation until new information emerges". In the latter case, he said, Italian investigators would provide all information currently at their disposal -- both what they have learned through the media and what has been found by Italian investigators who visited Egypt -- to the Italian judiciary. "This would give the Italian authorities the right to widen the circle of suspicion to include more suspects, with the possibility of eventually proving them guilty," said Mefreh. "In this case, the Italian judiciary could file a request to have these suspects detained." If the Egyptian government failed to surrender the accused individuals to the Italian authorities, Mefreh added, the latter could bring the case before the European Union and Interpol. - 'Lockerbie scenario' Said Sadek, a political sociology professor at the American University in Cairo, told Anadolu Agency that Egypt could -- in the event that it failed to surrender the suspects -- end up with a "Lockerbie scenario". The Lockerbie case involved a U.S. passenger plane that went down over the Scottish village of Lockerbie in 1988. Three years later, an arrest order was issued in the U.S. and Britain for two Libyans suspected of bombing the plane. Libya, however, refused the request and launched its own investigation, detaining the two suspects and asking both countries to provide what evidence it had against them. The case ultimately ended up with sanctions being imposed on Libya. "Italy’s decision to recall its ambassador in Cairo is a diplomatic escalation intended to express displeasure about the lack of progress in the Egyptian investigation and appease Italian public opinion -- and also to put pressure on Egypt," Sadek said. "It could eventually lead to diplomatic relations being cut." A second scenario is that the case may be raised at the European Parliament, after which foreign ministers from EU member states could impose sanctions on Egypt. On March 9, the European Parliament issued an urgent statement in which it advised member states to cut aid to Egypt due to perceived Egyptian stonewalling in the Regeni case. - Envoy recalled On Saturday, Italy officially notified Egypt that it had recalled its ambassador for "consultations", an Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman said. According to a statement issued by the Italian Foreign Ministry, Ambassador Maurizio Massari was summoned to Rome to discuss the Regeni case. The decision was taken after Egyptian and Italian prosecutors had discussed the matter in Rome, the statement added, going on to call for "an urgent evaluation" in order to "find the truth about the barbaric Regeni murder." Italy’s official ANSA news agency reported that Italian officials had found information provided by the Egyptian authorities to be "insufficient" and that the Italian side had left the meeting dissatisfied. Regeni vanished on Jan. 25 -- the fifth anniversary of a popular uprising that forced autocratic President Hosni Mubarak to step down after 30 years in power.

The UK Foreign Office on Monday called for a "full and transparent" investigation into the murder of Italian student Guilio Regeni in Egypt. Regeni, whose body was found in a ditch on the outskirts of Cairo in February, was a PhD student at Cambridge University in the UK. "The British minister for the Middle East and North Africa, Tobias Ellwood, as well as British officials in London and Cairo, has stressed to the Egyptian authorities the need for a full and transparent investigation, in full cooperation with the Italian authorities," a spokesperson for the British embassy in Cairo told Ahram Online. A parliamentary petition calling on the British government to ensure a “credible” investigation into the killing this week reached 10,000 signatures. At 100,000 signatures, the petition will be considered for debate in Parliament. "As an Italian national, it’s right that the Italian authorities are taking the lead in Giulio Regeni’s case. The UK government is in close contact with the Italian government in Rome, Cairo, and London, and stands ready to support their efforts in any way we can," the spokesperson added. The 28-year-old vanished from the streets of Cairo on 25 January, the fifth anniversary of the 2011 revolution. His body, discovered nine days later, showed signs of extensive torture. On Friday, Italy recalled its ambassador to Egypt for consultations after two days of meetings between Italian and Egyptian investigators, saying Egypt had failed to provide requested evidence. Egyptian investigators said that the Italians had demanded call logs of thousands of phone numbers in the area where Regeni lived and where his body was found. The “illegal and unconstitutional" requests were denied, they said. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry has affirmed that Regeni's case is not closed, stressing that cooperation is still ongoing between Egypt and Italy even though Egypt refused the Italian demand.

News article:
(MENAFN- The Journal Of Turkish Weekly) Israel hailed the sincere and very helpful cooperation it has received from Turkish officials in the immediate aftermath of deadly Istanbul attack in which its three citizens have been killed and envisaged this good as a way to help talks for the normalization of relations strained after the Mavi Marmara crisis of 2010. Dore Gold general-director of the Israeli Foreign Ministry has arrived in Istanbul during the late afternoon and was scheduled to meet with Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Feridun Sinirliolu and Istanbul Governor Vasip ahin. “The cooperation we have received from the Turkish officials was very sincere and very helpful” an Israeli diplomatic source toldHürriyet Daily Newson March 20. “It was more than 100 percent” added the source. Three Israeli citizens identified as 60-year-old Simha Simon Demri 40 year-old Yonathan Suher and 70-year-old Avaham Godman along with an Iranian a 31-year-old Ali Rza Khalman were killed in a suicide bomb attack on March 19 in Istanbul’s busy stiklal Street. Turkish police said identified the perpetrator as Mehmet 24-year-old Öztürk who had links with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The Israeli diplomat’s meeting with the Istanbul governor overwhelmingly focused on the details of the attack. Gold’s meeting with Sinirliolu has particular significance as the two diplomats have long been crafting a deal that would reconcile bilateral relations between the two countries. They negotiated an agreement in two meetings last year in Rome and in Geneva that would let the Israeli state pay compensation to the families of the Mavi Marmara victims and to allow unrestricted Turkish humanitarian access to Gaza. Gold and Sinirliolu negotiated these issues for a first time at a meeting in Turkey and diplomatic sources said the aforementioned negotiations would be on the two men’s agenda. “What we saw from the Turkish officials was the good will [in the aftermath of attack]. It was very clear. We can use this for widening the volume of our relations” the diplomatic source said. Not only the level of cooperation but the way Turkey expressed its sorrow over the killing of Israeli citizens have also been appreciated by Israeli officials. Prime MinisterAhmet Davutoluhas sent a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressing his condolences to the people ofIsraelon behalf of the Turkish people.

Gold stated that bilateral relations are taking a step forward, as Israel and Turkey find themselves on the same side in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism. He expressed his hope that with good will and understanding, the two sides can reach an agreement, citing similar statements from Turkish officials as a positive indication of success.

It seems that he sought to harm a large crowd of people. Security officials believe that if he wanted to harm Israelis in particular, he would have entered the restaurant where they were dining earlier and blown himself up inside it. Turkey informed Israel of progress in investigating the attack and also gave Israel information about the terrorist, who is known as an ISIS operative.

News article:
Turkey and Israel are currently in negotiations to normalize their diplomatic relations, which have been frozen since the 2010 Mavi Marmara raid when Israeli special forces killed 10 Turkish nationals on a ship carrying humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. Although reciprocal talks were reportedly kept behind the scenes since the diplomatic tensions began, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's statement openly giving a green light to such efforts for the first time since the Mavi Marmara raid hit the headlines. Considering Israel's isolation and plans to transfer Israeli natural gas to Europe, the situation is ripe for normalizing ties with Turkey, which sees this move as a step to contribute to the Palestinian cause and to gain a fresh ally in the troubled region. Turkey's being hit with two recent terror attacks in its capital and at the heart its economy within a week has become an opportunity for the two countries to establish closer contacts with each other. While Israel has for the first time condemned the March 13 Ankara bombing at the prime ministerial level after a long wait, Erdoğan conveyed his condolences to his Israeli President Reuven Rivlin for the three Israeli citizens killed in the DAESH suicide attack on Istanbul's İstiklal Avenue last week. With Rivlin's calling Erdoğan in the first high-ranking official contact for some time, the incidents have paved the way for the two countries to re-establish closer ties.As the latest attack showed, neither country is safe even for their citizens outside their borders, as terror attacks can strike at any time in any place. This development also left questions regarding whether the two countries can accelerate their reconciliation talks within the framework of cooperation in security and intelligence while entering the 67th year of diplomatic ties.As Turkey is confronting multiple terror campaigns by the PKK and its affiliated groups in addition to Bashar Assad and DAESH with the five-year civil war in its southern neighbor Syria, Israel also recognizes the growing and deepening threat from DAESH for the country and the region as a whole, as DAESH has already become established in Syria to Israel's north.Against the escalated surge of terror, Ankara reiterates that it is determined in the fight against any terror without any "our terrorist, your terrorist" understanding, and with this perspective, the country wants to play a role in facilitating peace in the region."Turkey still has good communication channels with important actors in the Middle East such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, but it has to rebuild its connections with Israel and Egypt if it wants to completely fulfil its potential as a regional power," Gallia Lindenstrauss, a research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said.Regarding Turkey's position in the region, she also said that "such communication channels have only become more significant following the Arab upheavals and not less significant."Nimrod Goren, chairman of Mitvim, the Israeli Institute for Regional Foreign Policies, pointed to the unification process on Cyprus and the necessity to restore constructive political dialogue between Turkey and Egypt."For Israel, it will be good to have Turkey get closer to the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean, some of which are currently concerned with Israel-Turkey reconciliation due to their differences with Turkey. The Eastern Mediterranean can and should become a zone of cooperation and win-win policies rather than a zone of conflict and zero-sum diplomacy," he said.The 67-year history of bilateral ties started in 1949 when the two countries encountered rising threats to their national security in the region and a development in relations was sought. The same scenario might be witnessed now in a time in which both countries suffer from terror as well. Historical experience has proven the two countries have struggled together against different threats in the region or, at least, have broken the ice following several tense periods.Turkey's relations with Israel have never been independent from its ties with Western countries under the scope of NATO and Arab states. Although among the 13 countries that voted against the U.N. Partition Plan for Palestine in 1947, Turkey later recognized Israel on March 3, 1949, 10 months after the country was established. Concerning these initial contacts, the Turkish president at the time, İsmet İnönü, is described in the Israel State Archives of Prime Minister's Office as the " father of the relations ."The first major crisis in bilateral relations rose with the threat from pan-Arabism led by Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt, especially after Israel's Sinai campaign backed by Britain and France. Nasser's constant threats to Turkey and its pro-Western partner Iraq in the Baghdad Pact caused Turkey to downgrade its relations with Israel from minister to charge d'affaires.Only 45 days later, however, following a pro-Nasser coup in Iraq in 1958, a secret meeting between then Turkish Prime Minister Adnan Menderes and Israeli Prime Minister David Ben Gurion together with top-diplomat Golda Meir, became the precursor to a new era in bilateral relations. To keep the meeting a secret, two Israeli officials were even delivered to a plane to land at Ankara in an ambulance for security reasons after arriving at Istanbul's Atatürk International Airport.In the meeting, Israel took the first step to form a peripheral pact in the region together with Iran and Ethiopia. According to the agreement, which would remain undisclosed for many years, the two sides initiated security and intelligence cooperation alongside other areas of collaboration in unity against Nasser's pan-Arabist policies. Photos archived in Israel's Government Press Office Israel's first President Haim Weizman (L) and Seyfullah Esin, the first Turkish envoy to Israel after the accredition ceremony in Rehovot on July 3, 1950. Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy (L) shaking hands with his Turkish counterpart Tansu Çiller after signing an agreement during his visit to Ankara on April 9, 1997. During Turgut Özal's time as prime minister between 1983 and 1991, Turkey managed to juggle ties with the Palestinians and Israel. Despite condemning the Sabra and Shatilla Massacres that occurred in 1982 and establishing good relations with the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), the growing threat from the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) and the PKK starting a conflict that would continue for more than three decades led to a turning point in security and intelligence cooperation with Israel. Even with right-wing Likud as the ruling party of Israel, none would be worse off for keeping this level of cooperation. Furthermore, Israel starting a peace process with the Arabs in the 1991 Madrid and 1993 Oslo Accords was welcomed by Turkey and encouraged Ankara to take more solid steps to develop relations. Following the two countries' presidents' reciprocal visits, both the Military Training and Cooperation Agreement and the Defense Industrial Cooperation Agreement were signed in 1996, paving the way for annual meetings between the two countries' intelligence officials, especially regarding handling the PKK. As a symbolic figure of the army at the time, Deputy Chief of Staff Çevik Bir with Israel Defense Ministry Director-General Major General David Ivri, who were the pioneers of these bolstered ties. This cooperation reached a peak with the capture of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan in 1999 thanks to help from Israel's Mossad. The close ties inherited from the previous decades were protected as the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) came to power in 2002, although several crises and bilateral rows were also experienced. Contrary to stereotypical comments labeling the AK Party as Islamist, Ankara continued to bolster ties with Israel and it began to play a mediatory role in peace talks between Israel and Syria.Yet, the Cast Lead Operation to Gaza in 2008, which started a couple of days after then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's visit to Turkey and meeting with then Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, became the first spark in the downfall of relations.With the "one-minute" incident in Davos, in which Erdoğan walked off the stage after a heated exchange with then Israeli President Shimon Peres after a panel discussion on Gaza, together with the January 2010 incident when Danny Ayalon, the Israeli deputy foreign minister, publicly humiliated Turkish ambassador Oğuz Çelikkol during a press conference at the Knesset, relations rapidly deteriorated.With the Mavi Marmara raid in 2010, which left 10 people dead and 55 wounded after a flotilla organized by the international Free Gaza Movement and the İHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation İHH was raided by Israeli forces in international waters, relations were downgraded to charge d'affaires.Arab uprisings in the following year and the dramatic changes shaping the region's future took a negative turn when the civil war erupted in Syria. As the war-torn country continues to see many global powers and regional actors conduct proxy wars, DAESH still remains the most serious threat to all parties.Ankara continues to highlight the threat from the PKK and its Syrian affiliate Democratic Union Party (PYD). The PYD plans to expand its territory throughout northern Syria, leading Ankara to regard its efforts as a threat to its national security.In such an atmosphere, Ankara might try into re-establishing cooperation in terms of intelligence and security, and the tragic event in Istanbul last week could be the point for seeking further rapprochement with Israel.Although Lindenstrauss pointed out that reciprocal mistrust still exists and can burden future cooperation, she said that the DAESH attack in Istanbul required collaboration between both sides, and Israeli representatives gave the matter considerable attention."The further inquiry into the circumstances of this event, for example, whether Israelis were specifically targeted in the attack or just unlucky bystanders, can perhaps serve as a micro test of the potential for better cooperation between the two states."Speaking to Daily Sabah, Turkey's ambassador in Tel Aviv before the Mavi Marmara raid, Çelikkol, said that such cooperation has always existed and that it is difficult to imagine it being terminated completely."This [cooperation] can continue; there is no problem in it. However, we have to mention that there is a normalization process of relations and it is greatly desired. There were several conditions from Turkey and some of them have been met."Ankara insists that all of its conditions must be met, including ending the Gaza blockade and compensation for the Turkish activists killed in the Mavi Marmara raid. The only condition that Israel has satisfied so far came when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized for the raid in 2013.Çelikkol, who is also the author of the book "One Minute'ten Mavi Marmara'ya: Türkiye-İsrail Çatışması" (From One Minute to Mavi Marmara: The Turkey-Israel Conflict), stressed that balances in the Middle East are changing with Russia's military presence in Syria, something that really greatly Turkey and Israel, with a normalization of relations being crucial considering the circumstances."The first step of this would be appointing ambassadors and maintaining relations from this level. This is an obligation."Regarding relations, Lindenstrauss also said: "Normalization in relations between Israel and Turkey can also mean a return to greater NATO-Israel collaboration, and this can have an indirect and positive effect also on Turkey's security."Goren thinks that cooperation should extend further than it has done so before. He said: "The cooperation between the two countries should go beyond the security realm. It should also include economic cooperation – especially in regards to the Eastern Mediterranean natural gas – more extensive interactions between civil society, journalists and academics as well as increased Turkish involvement in efforts to promote Israeli-Palestinian and Israeli-Arab conflict resolution."

WASHINGTON (JTA) — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with Jewish leaders here reportedly to smooth ties as Turkey and Israel seek to reconcile. Jewish groups in attendance included the Anti-Defamation League, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, B’nai B’rith International, the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. “Erdogan and the guests reiterated their willingness to strengthen cooperation and communication despite differences,” said a report Wednesday in Turkey’s Daily Sabah newspaper, citing “presidential sources.” Already rocky, relations between Turkey and Israel hit a new low following Israel’s deadly raid in 2010 of a Turkish ship attempting to breach its blockade of the Gaza Strip. Reconciliation talks are ongoing. Daily Sabah said the participants, who included top Turkish officials, discussed “recent terror attacks in Turkey and Belgium, the war against terror, Turkey’s relations with Jews, the relations between the U.S., Israel and Turkey, the situation in Palestine, the refugee crisis, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.” Jewish organizational participants said the meeting was off the record, and declined to comment, even after the meeting was reported in the Turkish press. The American Jewish Committee, not present at the meeting, welcomed Erdogan’s overtures, while recalling recent statements by members of his party that blame Jews for Turkey’s woes. “President Erdogan’s expressed commitment to ‘fight’ anti-Semitism is particularly welcome in light of past statements by him and other AKP leaders,” said Jason Isaacson, AJC Associate Executive Director for Policy and Director of Government and International Affairs, in an email to JTA. “The security of Turkey’s venerable – and vulnerable – Jewish community must be a high priority.” In recent months Erdogan has expressed an interest in renewing ties with Israel, stemming from a joint interest in tamping down the violence in Syria, which neighbors both countries; the discovery of natural gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean, which Israel already is exploring with Cyprus and Greece, and Erdogan’s desire to isolate his main rival in the region, Russia. After the March 19 terrorist attack in Istanbul in which three Israelis were among five dead and many Israelis were injured, Erdogan phoned his Israeli counterpart, Reuven Rivlin, and said the two countries should cooperate in battling terrorism. In an address at the Brookings Institution think tank Thursday, Erdogan said the attack was not solely aimed at Israel. He expressed hope that the tragedy had brought the former allies closer together. Relations between Turkey and the United States are tense because of differences over Turkey’s attacks on Kurdish militias. Turkey sees them as a threat, while the United States see them as critical to restoring calm in that country’s devastating civil war. Erdogan is in Washington for a nuclear summit, but President Barack Obama refused to meet with him formally, although they had an informal chat. Separately, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the top Democrat on the Senate’s Middle east subcommittee, said this week that he was surprised to find during a recent Middle East tour that Erdogan and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were equally appalled at expressions of anti-Muslim rhetoric by Republican candidates in the presidential election. “These guys agree on nothing but they both said to this group of senators ‘what’s going on in the presidential race?’,” Kaine said on VA Talk Radio Network, in a report picked up by BuzzFeed.

News article:
Negotiating teams from Israel and Turkey will meet on Thursday in Europe in an effort to bridge the remaining gaps standing in the way of a reconciliation agreement between the two countries, Haaretz reported on Monday. Senior Israeli officials noted that in recent weeks, and since the latest round of negotiations between the two countries, several drafts have been exchanged between Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's envoy, Joseph Ciechanover, and Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioglu on the provisions of the reconciliation agreement that are still in dispute. The two main issues remaining to be resolved in the reconciliation agreement relate to Israel's demand that Turkey put a halt to the operations of the Hamas military headquarters in Istanbul and Turkey's demand that Israel take certain steps to ease the situation in the Gaza Strip, according to Haaretz. In a speech last week to the Brookings Institution in Washington, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he was interested in having Israel "remove the embargo" on Gaza and allow Turkey to bring a power generator ship to the Gaza coast to supply electricity to the territory. A senior Israeli official noted on Monday that when it comes to Gaza, Turkey will not be granted a special status, and Israel is willing to allow it to operate in the Strip in accordance with the same terms that apply to any country wishing to transfer aid. Another issue still under discussion is the order of the steps that will be taken after a deal is signed, according to the report. The senior Israeli official noted that only after all the standing cases against Israeli soldiers and officers in Turkey are closed will Israel transfer $20 million to a humanitarian fund, to be used as compensation for the families of Turkish citizens killed in the Mavi Marmara incident. The relations between Turkey and Israel have been strained since 2010, following the incident on the Mavi Marmara, which attempted to breach Israel’s naval blockade on Gaza, but reports in recent months indicated that Israel and Turkey had reached "understandings" to normalize the ties that were downgraded following that incident. The official who spoke to Haaretz on Monday was carefully optimistic about the coming round of the negotiations, saying, "There's a will to get it over with. We haven't seen such positive comments from Turkey in the last six years. We hope to find a formula that will enable an agreement." In recent weeks, Erdogan has been conveying a series of messages to Jerusalem both publicly and through diplomatic channels regarding his desire to come to a reconciliation agreement. Last week, the Turkish president met in Washington with the leaders of major American Jewish organizations, telling them that he hoped to come to an agreement with Israel as soon as possible. In another development, following last month's terrorist attack in Istanbul in which three Israelis were among the dead, Erdogan sent a condolence letter to Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. Several days later, the two presidents spoke by phone at Rivlin's initiative.

News article:
Turkey and Israel started talks to normalize diplomatic relations during a meeting in Switzerland in early February, and delegations from the two countries will continue the efforts to successfully finalize it on Tuesday. According to Israeli sources, there have been several draft statements regarding provisions of the normalization agreement exchanged between Turkish and Israeli officials since the latest meeting. While President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in previous statements stressed the significance of the meetings that are to be held in April, Ankara's priority for the meeting is easing the blockade on Gaza. It is expected that due to the positive attitude from both sides that all complications will be addressed. Speaking to Daily Sabah on Tuesday, Dr. Gallia Lindenstrauss from the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Israel drew attention to the positive attitudes from both the Turkish and Israeli sides and Dr. Fahrettin Altun, the Istanbul coordinator for the Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research (SETA), said that although it is an ongoing process, normalization between the two countries is necessary. Additionally, Şalom newspaper columnist Karel Valansi similarly touched on the positive attitude in the meetings, saying: "A deal is possible with the good will of both sides." According to reports in the Israeli Haaretz daily, the Wednesday meeting is considered a first in diplomatic traffic due to a meeting being signaled by the President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rather than being announced through media outlets. Although the location of the meeting is expected to be in Geneva, like the previous meetings, it is still undecided. Prior to today's meeting, Turkish and Israeli officials first met in December 2015 and reached a preliminary agreement to normalize relations, including the return of ambassadors to both countries, after Israel agreed to pay $20 million in compensation to the relatives of the victims of the Mavi Marmara raid. During the meeting held in early February 2016, Turkish and Israeli officials discussed easing rather than lifting Israel's blockade of Gaza, which Ankara aims to begin rebuilding. Lindenstrauss said: "Both the Turkish president and Israeli prime minister have voiced their positive attitude toward the emerging agreement, and it is quite clear that the March 19 Istanbul terror attack in which three Israeli citizens were killed had in some respects brought the countries to better recognize some of their shared interests. "I believe the meeting will be productive in the sense that there will be certain advancement toward concluding the deal, though I'm not positive that there will not be a need for further negotiations." Altun said that the process is coming to an end and that it is not clear that Wednesday's meeting would be the final one. He added: "Turkey had always kept a positive attitude from the very beginning of the normalization process. The normalization is evidently needed for the Israeli side." Explaining that it is an ongoing process, Altun said that the normalization was expected by all and that it is a positive and productive process. Additionally, Shalom columnist Valansi said: "The situation in Gaza is always a deal breaker. There is no big conflict in Gaza and there is also the recent decision by Israel to expand permitted areas south of Wadi Gaza. We know each side's demands. A deal is possible with the good will of both sides. I think they may manage to reconcile." Valansi also said that there are many positive messages as well as a will to leave the Mavi Marmara incident behind. During his visit to Africa in early January, Erdoğan said that an improvement of ties would benefit both countries and that Turkey aims to repair the electricity infrastructure in Gaza and send aid material to Gaza through Turkey. With the meeting in February held shortly after Erdoğan's meeting with U.S. Jewish leaders, which was considered the latest sign of a thaw in bilateral relations, the meeting today will once again be held after Erdoğan received a delegation of members from Jewish associations in the United States last week. shortlink copied KEYWORDS homepage

We have to fight against those hatred-based movements in a cooperative manner." Erdoğan also mentioned his phone call with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. Presidential sources further added that the representatives of the U.S. Jewish associations expressed their gratitude to Turkey for the Israeli victims of the terror attack on Istanbul's İstiklal Avenue perpetrated by DAESH.

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said he will attend a wedding ceremony at a synagogue and be a marriage witness for the couple. When asked about the upcoming event, the Turkish Jewish Community (TYC) declined to give further details. During his visit to the United States last week, Erdoğan received a delegation of members from Jewish associations in the U.S. During the meeting, Erdoğan stressed the need for cooperation against anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in the West. Pointing to the rise of racism in the West, Erdoğan said: "Unfortunately, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic and xenophobic movements have been taking center stage in politics. We have to fight against those hatred-based movements in a cooperative manner." Erdoğan also mentioned his phone call with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. Presidential sources further added that the representatives of the U.S. Jewish associations expressed their gratitude to Turkey for the Israeli victims of the terror attack on Istanbul's İstiklal Avenue perpetrated by DAESH. The representatives also extended their condolences to Erdoğan for the victims of the recent terror attacks in Ankara and Istanbul. shortlink copied KEYWORDS homepage

News article:
Turkish and Israeli negotiators are having talks at an undisclosed location in pursuit of a reconciliation agreement to resume normalized relations. Both countries have a lot to gain from détente, and any step toward easing tensions in the Middle East should be cause for celebration. As a former member of Turkish Parliament, who has vocally supported closer Turkish-Israeli ties and a “peace pipeline” carrying Israeli gas to Turkey via Cyprus, it is encouraging to see that the talks that started in June 2015 have come this far. However, I have serious concerns about the shaky foundations of Turkish-Israeli rapprochement, and remain unconvinced about its sustainability. Turkey’s government mouthpieces – notorious for their anti-Semitic and anti-Israel vitriol – seem to be in a celebratory mood about the apparently impending reconciliation. A pro-government daily, for example, published not only a front-page endorsement of normalization but accompanied it with news of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s plans to serve as a witness at a wedding in an Istanbul synagogue. Last week, the media ran similar praise for Erdoğan’s meeting with Jewish-American leaders during his Washington visit. Such positive coverage is an extraordinary development in a country that, according to the Anti-Defamation League, harbors higher levels of anti-Semitism than Iran. The U-turn of the pro-government media, which only a year ago aired a documentary alleging a millennia-long Jewish conspiracy to dominate the world, is curious, to say the least. Also curious are the new public-diplomacy efforts at the Foreign Ministry. Ankara’s consulate and congregants of a Modern-Orthodox synagogue in New York will co-organize a conference this Sunday on the “Inclusion and Prosperity of Ottoman Turkish Sephardi Jews.” The conference marketing proudly features a photo of the recently restored Grand Synagogue in the city of Edirne, which is being billed as a monumental testimony to the Turkish state’s embrace of its Jewish citizens. Somehow, the conference organizers neglected to recall the Edirne governor’s appalling pledge that he would not allow Jews to worship in the synagogue, let alone the 1934 pogroms that cleansed the area from Jews in the first place. Erdoğan’s Islamist-rooted Justice and Democracy Party (AKP), which has ruled Turkey since 2002, is attempting to paper over some ugly truths. The AKP is desperate to overhaul its failed foreign policy – including an ongoing crisis with Russia, fear of Iran’s rising regional hegemony, and the collapse of Turkey’s vision for Muslim Brotherhood rule in Egypt and Syria. With its list of regional enemies mounting, the AKP hopes to steer Turkey back to its traditional allies: the European Union, NATO, and Israel. This is why Erdoğan recently toned down his anti-Western rhetoric and miraculously come to appreciate the transactional relationships he can establish with pragmatic counterparts, rather than the Islamists he was courting just months ago. Turkey’s government, however, still offers frequent reminders of its hypocrisy on Jews and Israel. Following last month’s suicide bombing in Istanbul, a board member of the AKP’s women’s branch in the city tweeted her wish for the wounded Israeli tourists to have been killed. A few weeks before, a chief advisor to the president appeared in pro-government media to attack political rivals as “raising soldiers for the Jews.” The board member had to leave her post but the chief advisor is still serving. For those of us committed to combating prejudice against Turkey’s minorities, the current state of affairs poses a particular challenge. In the run-up to the Turkish-Israeli rapprochement, Turkish analysts are expected to turn a blind eye to years of anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli propaganda disseminated by Turkey’s top officials and their mouthpieces. But it would be a mistake to do so. A Sephardic friend of mine once told me her parents raised her in accordance with kayades, a Judeo-Spanish word for Turkish Jews’ code of silence in the face of discrimination. Today, those seeking to point out the disingenuous premises of Erdoğan’s reconciliation attempts are forced to wrestle with kayades once again. Thankfully, some Turkish citizens have already made the right choice. On this year’s International Holocaust Remembrance Day, a handful of Turkish Jews and their non-Jewish friends launched Avlaremoz, a news site dedicated to combating anti-Semitism in Turkey. Avlaremoz means “Let’s talk” in Judeo-Spanish, and is a direct challenge to kayades. As expected, Avlaremoz was one of the few news outlets that covered the Erdoğan advisor’s remarks. Advertisement Turkish-Israeli rapprochement is important for regional stability. A sustainable relationship, however, cannot be built on hypocrisy and silence. Turkish society needs to recognize and confront the pervasive anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli sentiment that has taken hold of wide segments of the population, due in large part to the influence of the AKP. A future built on dialogue must start with genuine conversation about the wrongs of the past, but also about the dangerous politics that have led us to this perilous present. — Aykan Erdemir is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a former member of the Turkish parliament.

News article:
Ankara: Turkey and Israel are on the brink of restoring their ties after a bitter falling out five years ago, the Turkish foreign ministry announced early Friday after talks in London. Nato member Turkey was a key regional ally of Israel until the two countries cut ties in 2010 over the deadly storming by Israeli commandos of a Turkish aid ship bound for Gaza, which left 10 Turkish aid activists dead. After years of bitter accusations and inflammatory rhetoric, the two sides held secret talks in December to seek a rapprochement, with another round taking place in February in Geneva. “The teams made progress towards finalising the agreement and closing the gaps, and agreed that the deal will be finalised in the next meeting which will be convened very soon,” the Turkish ministry said in a statement after the fresh round of talks Thursday. Israel’s foreign ministry, contacted by AFP, declined to comment. Ankara said the latest talks in London brought together powerful Turkish foreign ministry official Feridun Sinirlioglu, Joseph Ciechanover, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Israeli National Security Adviser Jacob Nagel. In an interview with Turkish newspaper Vatan on Friday, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said “significant progress has been made”, adding that the two sides were hoping to reach “a final stage” in the talks soon. Turkey had already said in February that the former allies were “close to concluding a deal”. But they had yet to agree on all of Turkey’s conditions, with the main hurdle appearing to be the lifting of Israel’s blockade on the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. Israel apologised to Turkey in 2013, in what many thought would trigger a warming in ties, but tensions soared again the following year when Israel launched a massive military offensive in Gaza. Turkey’s other condition is that victims of the Mavi Marmara be compensated, and has said that talks have advanced in this regard. The Mavi Marmara was one of six ships which headed to Gaza in May 2010 carrying humanitarian supplies in a bid to break the blockade of the Strip which has been in place since 2007, shortly after Hamas won elections there. The blockade has been branded cruel and inhumane by rights groups, although Israel argues it is necessary to stop weapons smuggling. Analysts have suggested that Turkey’s desire for a rapprochement has been accelerated by the drastic worsening in ties with Moscow since the shooting down of a Russian warplane wrecked several joint projects. Ankara relies on Russia for more than half its natural gas imports and Turkey now has its eyes on Israeli gas reserves. In a highly symbolic encounter, Erdogan last week met representatives of Jewish organisations in the US to discuss the fight against terrorism and racism. “Unfortunately, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, xenophobic movements have been shifting from the periphery to the centre of politics. We have to struggle against them together,” he said. Another sign of a thaw in relations came when Israeli President Reuven Rivlin phoned Erdogan to thank him for his compassion after a suicide bombing in Istanbul last month left three Israelis dead.

Turkey, Israel make progress on deal to restore ties - Turkish ministry ISTANBUL, April 8 (Reuters) - Turkish and Israeli teams made progress towards finalising an agreement to mend ties between the two countries in talks and agreed a deal will be finalised in the next meeting to be convened very soon, the Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday. Turkey was once Israel's closest regional ally but ties collapsed in 2010 over the killing by Israeli marines of 10 Turkish pro-Palestinian activists who tried to breach the Gaza blockade. Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioglu, the Israeli prime minister's special envoy, Joseph Ciechanover, and acting chairman of Israel's National Security Council, General Jacob Nagel, met in London on Thursday, the Turkish ministry said in a statement. "The teams made progress towards finalising the agreement and closing the gaps, and agreed that the deal will be finalised in the next meeting which will be convened very soon," the ministry said. It did not say what form a deal might take but Ankara has always insisted there can be no normalisation in ties with Israel unless its conditions for ending the Gaza blockade and compensation for the deaths of the activists are met. Israel allows commercial goods into Gaza daily but limits the transfer of certain items such as cement and building materials as it fears militants will use them to build fortifications.

Turkey, Israel closer to deal on normalization of ties: Ankara Iran Press TV Fri Apr 8, 2016 7:28AM Ankara says Turkey and Israel have made progress towards the conclusion of an agreement aimed at ending a six-year freeze in their relations. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said its undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioglu, the Israeli PM's special envoy Joseph Ciechanover and Israeli general Jacob Nagel met in London Thursday to discuss the reconciliation deal. The statement on Friday further said Ankara and Tel Aviv had agreed that an accord would be finalized in the next meeting, which would happen very soon. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu confirmed earlier on Thursday that the two sides have been holding fresh negotiations on the normalization of ties. "Meetings with Israel have been taking place for a while and they are continuing today," Davutoglu said. The Turkish premier added that "the next steps will be clear and the necessary announcements will be made to the public" in case Ankara's demands are received favorably. Israeli daily Haaretz also said in a recent report that the negotiating teams were set to meet for discussions on ways to narrow remaining differences on issues such as Hamas headquarters in Istanbul and the Gaza siege. The meetings come after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed readiness to normalize his country's relations with Tel Aviv after six years of strained relations. In January, Erdogan said Turkey needed Israel in the region as the two sides indicated their enthusiasm to normalize relations. On March 24, Turkish media quoted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as saying that Tel Aviv wanted to mend relations with Ankara. He said Israel has always maintained a policy of rapprochement with Turkey. Turkey and Israel see eye to eye on the Syria conflict and the need to topple President Bashar al-Assad. Ankara is suspected of actively training and arming Takfiri militants operating inside Syria and buying smuggled oil from them. Israel has set up hospitals near the border with Syria to treat militants injured in the fight with Syrian troops. Israel and Turkey were traditionally close allies in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Ankara-Tel Aviv relations, however, soured following an Israeli attack on an aid ship that was attempting to break the Israeli naval blockade of the Gaza Strip in May 2010. The raid killed nine Turkish citizens and injured about 50 other people who were part of the team on the six-ship convoy. A tenth Turkish national later succumbed to his injuries. In September that year, Turkey suspended its military ties with Israel and expelled the Israeli envoy from Ankara over Tel Aviv's refusal to apologize for its killing of the Turkish nationals aboard the Gaza-bound vessel.

News article:
Since the end of the Cold War the most frequently discussed relations in the Middle East have been the ties between Turkey and Israel. Relations between the two countries developed quickly after the Madrid Peace Conference when relations were upgraded to the ambassadorial level. Throughout the 1990s, Turkey and Israel engaged in multiple bilateral security and military engagements. Some even considered these bilateral relations as a formula for stability in the Middle East. These relations, however, proved to be short lived when the peace process broke down and Ankara launched a more multidimensional foreign policy. Although Turkey continued to play a critical role in an attempt to relaunch peace talks between Israel and Syria in 2009, later, with the Operation Cast Lead and the Gaza flotilla crisis, relations were downgraded back to their pre-1991 level. After an apology from Israel in 2013 and the ensuing negotiations that took place between Israeli and Turkish foreign policy makers, it appears as though ties will be mended and relations will be upgraded to the ambassadorial level once again in the coming weeks. In a statement after the last meeting of the diplomats in London, the Turkish Foreign Ministry made a press statement emphasizing: "The teams made progress toward finalizing the agreement and closing the gaps, and agreed that the deal will be finalized in the next meeting, which will be convened very soon." The question is what the future of relations will look like after mending ties. Firstly, any comparison of relations with those during the 1990s will bring too many expectations for relations and pressure on foreign policy makers. The conditions that made the rapprochement possible between the two countries in the 1990s are not similar. There is no active peace process to provide significant public approval of relations in Turkey. In the 1990s, the Oslo Peace Process and the possibility of an agreement between Israel and Palestine based on a two-state solution provided important support for relations between Turkey and Israel. In the coming period, the absence of such a process will be the highest hurdle in the future of relations between the two countries. Due to the numerous current conflicts in the region, however, public opinion in Turkey seems distracted, and there is still high sensitivity to the issue. The recent, nervous voices being heard in talks of the future of bilateral ties show the presence of this sensitivity. Secondly, the geopolitical positioning of the countries is very different than that of the 1990s. Yes, in the 1990s the crises between these two countries concerning their relations with Syria played an important role in generating a common denominator and common threat perception, but today both countries have issues with the situation in Syria and their policy preferences and interests are different. Turkey's relations with the different actors in the Middle East are quite different than in the 1990s. Thirdly, the tri-lateralism that existed between Turkey, Israel and the United States is nearly nonexistent now. The normalization of Turkish-Israeli relations will definitely play a role in the relations of these two countries with the United States - the role of U.S. President Barack Obama in the apology process for the Mavi Marmara raid was very significant; however, the nature of tri-lateralism will not be on the same level that it was in the 1990s. Turkey and Israel's relations with the United States are very different compared to the aforementioned decade. It will be more bilateral than trilateral now. Of course, the two countries may find some other areas in which to work together in the changing region and could generate new areas of cooperation. There are already many speculations about the possible positioning of this normalization in the changing balance of power in the Middle East and shifting alliances. However, these are all speculations at this point and this will not change the fact that bilateral ties and the nature of relations will be very different than those in the 1990s. The absence of an Israeli-Palestinian peace process, as well as the common threat perception may make relations less stable compared to the 1990s. The public sensitivity in Turkey about the recent negotiations between Turkey and Israel demonstrate that normalization needs to be handled with care.

There is no active peace process to provide significant public approval of relations in Turkey. In the 1990s, the Oslo Peace Process and the possibility of an agreement between Israel and Palestine based on a two-state solution provided important support for relations between Turkey and Israel. In the coming period, the absence of such a process will be the highest hurdle in the future of relations between the two countries. Due to the numerous current conflicts in the region, however, public opinion in Turkey seems distracted, and there is still high sensitivity to the issue. The recent, nervous voices being heard in talks of the future of bilateral ties show the presence of this sensitivity. Secondly, the geopolitical positioning of the countries is very different than that of the 1990s. Yes, in the 1990s the crises between these two countries concerning their relations with Syria played an important role in generating a common denominator and common threat perception, but today both countries have issues with the situation in Syria and their policy preferences and interests are different. Turkey's relations with the different actors in the Middle East are quite different than in the 1990s. Thirdly, the tri-lateralism that existed between Turkey, Israel and the United States is nearly nonexistent now. The normalization of Turkish-Israeli relations will definitely play a role in the relations of these two countries with the United States - the role of U.S. President Barack Obama in the apology process for the Mavi Marmara raid was very significant; however, the nature of tri-lateralism will not be on the same level that it was in the 1990s. Turkey and Israel's relations with the United States are very different compared to the aforementioned decade. It will be more bilateral than trilateral now. Of course, the two countries may find some other areas in which to work together in the changing region and could generate new areas of cooperation. There are already many speculations about the possible positioning of this normalization in the changing balance of power in the Middle East and shifting alliances. However, these are all speculations at this point and this will not change the fact that bilateral ties and the nature of relations will be very different than those in the 1990s. The absence of an Israeli-Palestinian peace process, as well as the common threat perception may make relations less stable compared to the 1990s. The public sensitivity in Turkey about the recent negotiations between Turkey and Israel demonstrate that normalization needs to be handled with care.

News article:
During Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu's most recent visit to the Finnish capital Helsinki, he sat down with a group of journalists, including myself, covering his trip. Most reporters were primarily interested in domestic politics and, more specifically, whether or not Davutoğlu and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had differences of opinion regarding renewed dialogue with the PKK leadership and the broader topic of counterterrorism. "There is not an inch between where myself and the president stand on fighting terrorism," he said. Others were interested in the ongoing negotiations between Turkey and Israel. When Mehmet Çelik, a correspondent for Daily Sabah, brought up reports in the Israeli media about an upcoming meeting between Turkish and Israeli officials, Davutoğlu said the two countries were making progress and an additional meeting would take place soon. Upon returning to Turkey, we discovered that the highly anticipated meeting between Turkey and Israel had already happened. The Foreign Ministry issued a written statement to confirm that Undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioğlu had met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Special Envoy Joseph Ciechanover and Israeli National Security advisor Jacob Nagel in London. The ministry said that "the parties have made progress toward finalizing the agreement and addressing their differences and have resolved to conclude the agreement in their next meeting." The announcement was quite important because the Turkish government had been quite secretive about the negotiations in recent months. In a way, the Foreign Ministry's statement made it clear that Turkey and Israel had reached a point of no return in the talks. But I still had some questions: - Had Turkish and Israeli diplomats actually finalized the agreement but decided to hold an additional meeting to get the green light from their respective governments? - Had Israel met Turkey's three conditions? - Do certain disagreements still persist? - When will the next meeting take place? - Is it still possible for the next meeting to not yield results? A senior government official with extensive knowledge of the negotiations provided the following answers: Turkey and Israel do not agree 100 percent. There are still certain hurdles we must overcome. During the final meeting, representatives from both governments will get together and try to find a middle ground. But both governments have agreed to strike a deal at the final meeting. Israel agreed to Turkey's conditions. In 2013, Netanyahu had offered a formal apology to then Prime Minister Erdoğan. Turkey and Israel have also agreed on the financial settlement that Israel is to offer to the families of the victims of the Mavi Marmara raid. The tentative number is around $20 million. Finally, Israel is not willing to entirely lift the Gaza blockade due to national security concerns. However, they came up with an arrangement that Turkey finds satisfactory, which would involve Israel easing the restrictions by allowing Turkey to ship humanitarian aid to Gaza. The final hurdle in the negotiations relates to the Gaza blockade. Building on Israel's proposal, Erdoğan has specifically asked the energy crisis in Gaza be addressed as part of the negotiations. There is a crippling energy crisis going on right now that creates a number of challenges for ordinary people, including restricted access to clean water. Electricity is a basic need in the 21st century, and Turkey asked for this issue to be addressed, for which it offered to dispatch power ships – vessels capable of generating power – to the area. Our sense is that the Israel is not completely opposed to the idea, but they needed some time to think. Their concern seems to be that it will set a precedent. But they will have to respond to Turkey's request in the final meeting. The final meeting between Turkey and Israel will take place within the next two weeks, which means that the two governments might strike a deal soon and enter a new period in their bilateral relations. It is extremely unlikely for the final meeting to not produce any results. Neither side wants this to continue for much longer. If Israel agrees to Turkey sending a power ship to the Eastern Mediterranean, respective ambassadors will start serving in Ankara and Tel Aviv in no time. shortlink copied Last Update: Apr 11, 2016 10:37 am

Normalization of ties between Israel and Turkey hinges on reaching an agreement over humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, a senior official in Ankara said Monday. Ibrahim Kalin, spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said intense talks between the countries had yet to yield a deal to put an end to years of chilly ties. “The negotiations are continuing (but) we are not at the stage where we can say an agreement has been drafted and sealed.” Speaking in Ankara, he said there will be a “few more meetings” in the coming weeks to iron out key issues. His remarks contrast with a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement last week which suggested an agreement would be finalized “very soon,” following a meeting between representatives from both countries in London. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Kalin said Turkey insists on the “re-establishment of conditions for humanitarian aid to Gaza” and supports an independent state of Palestine “whose capital is East Jerusalem.” Talks have also reportedly gotten hung up over Israeli demands for a commitment from Turkey to end tacit support for the Hamas terror group, which is the de facto ruler of the Gaza Strip. NATO member Turkey was a key regional ally of Israel until the two countries fell out over Israel’s policy on the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip and the deaths of Turkish nationals in an IDF raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla of ships in 2010. Advertisement After several years of acrimonious accusations, two sides met in December in secret talks to seek a rapprochement, with another round of high-level talks taking place in February in Geneva. A bombing last month in Istanbul that left three Israelis dead also led to cooperation between the countries and high-level contacts between leaders in Ankara and Jerusalem for the first time in years. On Sunday, the annual meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) kicked off in Istanbul, where the with the 57-member body discussed the Palestinian cause, conflicts in member states and combating terrorism.

News article:
A spokesperson for the government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday said Turkey will not normalize relations with Israel until the Jewish state lifts the maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip. The spokesperson was responding to earlier claims by the Turkish Foreign Ministry, on Friday, that Turkish and Israeli negotiating teams have been finalizing a rapprochement deal. “Meetings with Israel have been taking place for a while and they are continuing today,” Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in Ankara on Thursday, Reuters reported. “If our demands are received favorably, then the next steps will be clear and the necessary announcements will be made to the public.” Israel and Turkey have been mired in a longstanding feud that originated with the 2010 Gaza flotilla incident, in which nine Turks were killed in clashes after Turkish militants attacked Israeli commandos who had boarded the flotilla. Israel takes issue with the fact that the Palestinian terror group Hamas, which controls Gaza, has its diplomatic and military headquarters in Istanbul. “It is extremely unlikely for the final meeting to not produce any results,” an anonymous Turkish official said, according to Haaretz. “Neither side wants this to continue for much longer. If Israel agrees to Turkey sending a power ship to the eastern Mediterranean, respective ambassadors will start serving in Ankara and Tel Aviv in no time.” On Sunday, the Israeli government warned its citizens visiting Turkey to leave the country as soon as they can due to serious terror threats in the wake of March’s terrorist bombing in Istanbul, in which three Israeli tourists were killed. Israeli tourists in Turkey should “avoid crowded tourist areas, follow instructions of local authorities, and get out as soon as possible,” the Israeli Counter-Terrorism Bureau said, adding that it has raised the risk of terror attacks against Israelis in Turkey to the highest level. “Real and immediate terror threats remain throughout the country,” the bureau said in a statement.

News article:
A senior adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday that Israel has agreed to fully lift the blockade on the Gaza Strip, as part of a reconciliation agreement between Jerusalem and Ankara reportedly set to be finalized in the coming weeks. The adviser, Arshad Hormuz, told a Hamas-run media outlet in Gaza that Israel has also agreed to the opening of a naval route between Turkish Cyprus and Gaza. Hamas, which is internationally recognized as a terrorist organization, has had control of Gaza since a bloody 2007 coup. Hormuz added that only “technical details” remained to be settled as part of the upcoming agreement, according to Israel’s Ynet news website. There was no confirmation of the report from Israel.

News article:
By Dov Benoavadia YERUSHALAYIM — As talks continue between Israel and Turkey to normalize relations, the United States is considering making its own contribution to the effort – the establishment of a QIZ (Qualified Industrial Zone) in southern Turkey, in which Israel and Turkey would jointly manufacture goods and send them on to the United States, duty free. Reports Thursday said that Israeli and Turkish teams had in recent weeks conducted intensive talks about overcoming the last issues to restore diplomatic relations. Relations between the two countries were cut off in 2010 in the wake of the Marmara flotilla incident, in which IDF soldiers opened fire on Turks who had attacked them as they sought to break the naval blockade of Gaza. Nine Turks were killed in that incident. On Thursday, Israel Radio reported that talks were also under way for the QIZ. Israel already has QIZ deals with Egypt and Jordan. In both cases, products manufactured in the zones that contain at least 35 percent Israeli components, input or ownership, with the balance being that of the country that hosts the QIZ, can be imported into the U.S. tax free. Both Jordan and Egypt have repeatedly expressed their satisfaction with the arrangement, as has Israel.

Turkey has not given up its condition to lift the Gaza siege in return for normalising relations with Israel, Turkish Presidency Spokesman Ibrahim Kalın said Monday, adding that the two sides have not reached a final agreement yet and that talks would continue over the coming weeks. Al- Araby al- Jadeed news agency cited a source familiar with the Turkish foreign ministry as saying that Israel has accepted two out of three of Turkey’s conditions, including to publicly apologise for what happened in the Mavi Marmara incident and to pay $20 million in compensation for the activists' families. Israel has also agreed to facilitate the access of Turkish ships to the Gaza Strip to deliver aid. Ankara also demanded that the electricity situation in Gaza improve by sending a power generating ship. According to the source, the Israeli delegation did not object to the Turkish demand but asked for more time to consult with the government in this regard. The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday that the negotiating teams from both sides have agreed to rapidly reach a deal on normalising ties after talks in London. "The teams made progress towards finalising the agreement and closing the gaps and agreed that the deal will be finalised in the next meeting which will be convened very soon," the ministry said in a statement.

Israel's Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said Saturday that Turkey and Israel have reached agreement on 90 percent of issues, aiming toward reconciliation between the two countries. The Times of Israel newspaper reported that Steinitz's comments came while speaking at a cultural event in Holon. The article added that agreement was reached on building a seaport for the Gaza Strip, however, this point was later denied by Steinitz's office. Steinitz is known to be close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A future deal is also important for Israel in terms of energy, as Turkey opposes the development of untapped oil fields located in the eastern Mediterranean, between Greek Cyprus and Israel, until the Cyprus issue is permanently resolved. Israel has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip since Hamas took control in 2007, with recurrent attacks or operations causing suffering for some 1.8 million people. On April 7, presidential spokesperson İbrahim Kalın said that Turkey will not drop its demand for an end to the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip in order to normalize relations with Israel, while Turkey's official policy retains a demand for an independent Palestine founded on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The Foreign Ministry said on April 7 that Turkish and Israeli delegations had made progress toward finalizing a deal. The ministry said Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioğlu, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Special Envoy Joseph Ciechanover and Acting Chairman-General Jacob Nagel of Israel's National Security Council attended a meeting on April 7. Haaretz newspaper in Israel also reported that the talks in London lasted well into the night, ending just before midnight. Sinirlioğlu previously met Israeli Foreign Ministry Director-General Dore Gold in Rome in June 2015 in efforts to normalize diplomatic relations. There has been concrete progress over the last couple of months in restoring bilateral relations, long-stalled since the Mavi Marmara raid. A DAESH-linked bombing on March 19 in Istanbul that killed three Israelis also led to cooperation between the countries, with high-level contacts between leaders in Ankara and Jerusalem for the first time in years. Turkish and Israeli officials first met in December 2015 and reached a preliminary agreement to normalize relations, including the return of ambassadors to both countries, after Israel agreed to pay $20 million in compensation to the relatives of the victims of the Mavi Marmara raid. During a meeting held in early February 2016, Turkish and Israeli officials discussed easing rather than lifting the blockade of Gaza, which Ankara aims to begin rebuilding. The diplomatic crisis between Turkey and Israel dates back to May 2010 when Israeli commandos boarded the Mavi Marmara, a civilian vessel carrying humanitarian aid and trying to break the Israeli blockade on Gaza, while it was in international waters. The Israeli government took the first step toward reconciliation on March 24, 2013, when Netanyahu, under the encouragement of U.S. President Barack Obama, apologized for the mishandling of the raid during a conference call with then Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Since then closed-door reconciliation talks have continued, but the agreement has been delayed due to local, general, presidential and early elections in Turkey, as well as Israel's attack on Gaza in 2014.

News article:
Israel's Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said Saturday that Turkey and Israel have reached agreement on 90 percent of issues, aiming toward reconciliation between the two countries. The Times of Israel newspaper reported that Steinitz's comments came while speaking at a cultural event in Holon. The article added that agreement was reached on building a seaport for the Gaza Strip, however, this point was later denied by Steinitz's office. Steinitz is known to be close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A future deal is also important for Israel in terms of energy, as Turkey opposes the development of untapped oil fields located in the eastern Mediterranean, between Greek Cyprus and Israel, until the Cyprus issue is permanently resolved. Israel has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip since Hamas took control in 2007, with recurrent attacks or operations causing suffering for some 1.8 million people. On April 7, presidential spokesperson İbrahim Kalın said that Turkey will not drop its demand for an end to the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip in order to normalize relations with Israel, while Turkey's official policy retains a demand for an independent Palestine founded on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The Foreign Ministry said on April 7 that Turkish and Israeli delegations had made progress toward finalizing a deal. The ministry said Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioğlu, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Special Envoy Joseph Ciechanover and Acting Chairman-General Jacob Nagel of Israel's National Security Council attended a meeting on April 7. Haaretz newspaper in Israel also reported that the talks in London lasted well into the night, ending just before midnight. Sinirlioğlu previously met Israeli Foreign Ministry Director-General Dore Gold in Rome in June 2015 in efforts to normalize diplomatic relations. There has been concrete progress over the last couple of months in restoring bilateral relations, long-stalled since the Mavi Marmara raid. A DAESH-linked bombing on March 19 in Istanbul that killed three Israelis also led to cooperation between the countries, with high-level contacts between leaders in Ankara and Jerusalem for the first time in years. Turkish and Israeli officials first met in December 2015 and reached a preliminary agreement to normalize relations, including the return of ambassadors to both countries, after Israel agreed to pay $20 million in compensation to the relatives of the victims of the Mavi Marmara raid. During a meeting held in early February 2016, Turkish and Israeli officials discussed easing rather than lifting the blockade of Gaza, which Ankara aims to begin rebuilding. The diplomatic crisis between Turkey and Israel dates back to May 2010 when Israeli commandos boarded the Mavi Marmara, a civilian vessel carrying humanitarian aid and trying to break the Israeli blockade on Gaza, while it was in international waters. The Israeli government took the first step toward reconciliation on March 24, 2013, when Netanyahu, under the encouragement of U.S. President Barack Obama, apologized for the mishandling of the raid during a conference call with then Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Since then closed-door reconciliation talks have continued, but the agreement has been delayed due to local, general, presidential and early elections in Turkey, as well as Israel's attack on Gaza in 2014.

News article:
Most of the issues in a reconciliation agreement between Israel and Turkey have been agreed upon, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said Saturday, expressing the hope that a deal would be finalized soon. Speaking at a cultural event in Holon, Steinitz, who is seen as close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said he did not want to get into the specifics of the agreement but that both sides “have a considerable interest” in reaching agreed terms. Asked about the question of a seaport for the Gaza Strip, Steinitz said the issue had not been discussed in the talks. (A Channel 10 report which said this issue, too, had been resolved was inaccurate, his office said.) Steinitz’s comments came two days after a senior adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that Israel has agreed to the opening of a naval route between Turkish Cyprus and Gaza. The adviser, Arshad Hormuz, also told a Hamas-run media outlet in Gaza that Israel has agreed to fully lift the blockade on Gaza as part of the agreement between Jerusalem and Ankara, which is reportedly set to be finalized in the coming weeks. Hamas, which is internationally recognized as a terrorist organization, has had control of Gaza since a bloody 2007 coup. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Hormuz added that only “technical details” remained to be settled as part of the upcoming agreement, according to Israel’s Ynet news website. There was no confirmation of the report from Israel. Israel maintains a security blockade of Gaza to prevent Hamas, which avowedly seeks to destroy the Jewish state, from importing weaponry for use against Israel. Earlier this week, Erdogan’s spokesman said the normalization of ties between Israel and Turkey hinges on reaching an agreement over humanitarian aid to Gaza. Advertisement Ibrahim Kalin said Turkey insists on the “re-establishment of conditions for humanitarian aid to Gaza” and supports an independent state of Palestine “whose capital is East Jerusalem.” The accord would come almost six years after a deadly 2010 raid on a Gaza-bound Turkish ship attempting to breach the blockade, in which 10 Turkish citizens were killed during a melee aboard the vessel. The incident led to a nosedive in bilateral relations that were already tense over Israel’s military policy in Gaza. Turkey demanded an immediate apology for the 2010 raid, compensation for the victims’ families and the lifting of the blockade on Gaza before normal relations could resume. Israel refused and only issued an official apology some three years later. Talks on compensation have reached advanced stages, according to reports, but one of the main hurdles has been the lifting of the Israeli blockade. Talks have also reportedly gotten hung up over Israeli demands for a commitment from Turkey to end tacit support for Hamas. After several years of chilly ties and acrimonious accusations from both sides, officials met in December in secret talks to seek a rapprochement, with another round of high-level talks taking place in February in Geneva. A bombing last month in Istanbul that killed three Israelis also led to cooperation between the countries and high-level contacts between leaders in Ankara and Jerusalem for the first time in years.

Baku, Azerbaijan, Apr.25 By Rufiz Hafizoglu - Trend: The talks on normalizing the relations between Turkey and Israel continue, TRT Haber TV channel quoted Ibrahim Kalin, spokesperson for Turkey's presidential administration, as saying Apr.25. He noted that the parties have achieved serious results during the talks. The removal of the Gaza Strip's blockade by Israel is one of the important issues, according to Kalin. After the deterioration of relations between Russia and Turkey, some Turkish media outlets reported that Turkey and Israel will resume the previous relations. Earlier, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed that Turkey and Israel had private talks. Relations between Israel and Turkey deteriorated after the Freedom Flotilla incident in 2010, when a convoy of six ships, including one under Turkey's flag, tried to approach the Gaza Strip with humanitarian aid and activists on board. The flotilla was blocked and stormed by Israeli forces, with eight Turkish citizens being killed. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Israel should apologize for the Freedom Flotilla incident, pay compensation to the families of those killed and end the blockade of the Gaza Strip.

The ongoing talks on the normalisation of relations between Turkey and Israel have reached the final stage, the spokesman for the Turkish presidency revealed yesterday. Speaking at a press conference in the Turkish capital Ankara, Ibrahim Kalin said an agreement would be signed to normalise relations after a final settlement is reached on the two final conditions set by Turkey: lifting the siege on Gaza and the compensation being paid to the families of those killed on the Mavi Marmara. Turkish-Israeli relations were strained in 2010 when Israeli military forces assaulted international activists, including Turks, who were on board the Mavi Marmara ship. The activists were attempting to lift the Israeli siege on Gaza. A number of Turkish activists were killed during the Israeli forces' attack. Turkey has set a number of conditions on the return of relations with Israel, including receiving an apology for the killing of Turkish activists, paying compensation to the victims' families, in addition to lifting the siege on the Gaza Strip. The Turkish Foreign Ministry announced last month that talks are ongoing with the Israeli side on the restoration relations, but the pending point that still hinders reaching a settlement is the Turkish condition to lift the blockade on Gaza, which Israel rejects. Israeli newspapers have said that Egypt is putting pressure on Tel Aviv to prevent any Turkish role in the Gaza Strip. Egypt refuses to open the Rafah border crossing to Palestinians.

News article:
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday that Israel and Turkey's negotiating teams will meet again in mid-May to try to reach a reconciliation deal. Erdogan told a press briefing in Zagreb, Croatia that the two countries are discussing the establishment of a series of humanitarian projects in Gaza relating to electricity and water, as part of the negotiations surrounding Turkish demands toward "lifting the embargo" on Gaza. Erdogan said that Turkey offered during negotiations to send a ship, anchored in Israel's Ashdod port, to provide electricity for Gaza to help cope with the Strip's severe energy crisis. He said Israel was reluctant, and offered the establishment of a power plant within Gaza, carried out between Turkey and Germany, as an alternative project. "We said that could be possible," said Erdogan. "We still haven't given up on the ship. Israel is also positive toward our proposal to address Gaza's water problem through water desalination plants or wells. There is also a need for schools and hospitals. We are seeking donors. Some have promised to contribute." A senior official in Jerusalem said that the date of the next round of Israel-Turkey talks, considered to be crucial, has not yet been determined but will presumably take place in mid-May. According to the senior official, Turkey has brought up the matter of sending a ship in the past but is no longer on the agenda. Instead, Israel has suggested other humanitarian projects Turkey can perform in Gaza. The official noted that Turkey's status in Gaza concerning Israel will not be different from any other country. The Israeli and Turkish negotiating teams met three weeks ago in London, attended by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's envoy, Joseph Ciechanover and Israel's deputy National Security Adviser Jacob Nagel and Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioglu. The Foreign Ministry in Ankara announced after that round that progress had been made in closing the gap toward reaching a reconciliation agreement. According to the announcement, the teams agreed that the deal would be reached in the next round of talks. One of the main issues, however, is the lack of consensus on Israel's demand to stop military command from Hamas' headquarters in Istanbul.

News article:
TORONTO (JTA) — Canada’s foreign affairs minister has called on the United Nations to review its appointment of a Canadian law professor with a history of anti-Israel bias to a key Middle East post. Stephane Dion is questioning the naming of Michael Lynk of Western University in Ontario as the U.N. Human Rights Council’s special rapporteur on human rights in Palestine. On Friday, the day after the council tapped Lynk, Dion tweeted: “We call on UNHRC President to review this appointment & ensure Special Rapporteur has track record that can advance peace in region.” Canada’s opposition Conservative Party also called for Lynk to be disqualified from the position based on his past statements on Israel. Lynk “was not put forward by Canada and does not represent the views of this government,” Dion’s office said in a statement to the Canadian Press, a national news agency. The statement also said Canada’s U.N. ambassador made it clear that the Human Rights Council should appoint a “professional, neutral and credible” candidate, the Canadian Press noted. Jewish advocacy groups in Canada used some of the strongest language in recent memory to denounce Lynk as having a long and public history of anti-Israel bias. The Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs said Lynk “has been significantly involved in anti-Israel advocacy in Canada,” including signing anti-Israel petitions, calling for Israel to be prosecuted for war crimes, accusing Israel of ethnic cleansing, addressing conferences promoting one binational state, and serving as a leader of a group that promotes Israeli Apartheid Week. Similar positions were sounded by B’nai Brith Canada and Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center. The Geneva-based group UN Watch said the council’s choice of Lynk was “a travesty of justice.”

(JTA) — The Palestinian Authority is circulating to U.N. Security Council members a draft resolution condemning Israeli building in the West Bank and Jerusalem. The resolution, which P.A. President Mahmoud Abbas reportedly is hoping to bring to a vote in two weeks, was reported Thursday by Haaretz, which cited Western diplomats and senior Palestinian officials. In a statement issued in response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Abbas “is taking a step that will push negotiations further away.” “The only way to advance peace is by direct negotiations and Abu Mazen is avoiding this,” the Israeli leader said, using Abbas’ nom de guerre. “The Palestinians educate their children on a daily basis that the settlements are Tel Aviv, Haifa and Acre.” According to Haaretz, the move to condemn the settlements has been in the works since the beginning of the year. A senior Palestinian official told the Israeli daily that Abbas will be arriving in New York on April 22, Passover eve, to attend the planned vote. Abbas is also expected over the next two weeks to make diplomatic visits to Paris, Berlin and Moscow to build support for the resolution. The Security Council last voted on such a resolution in February 2011. It was approved but vetoed by the United States. According to Haaretz, the draft states that the settlements are an obstacle to peace and Israel must stop construction. The resolution also condemns settler violence against Palestinians.

Palestinian officials have begun circulating a draft resolution among members of the the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). The resolution condemns Israeli construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and calls for its halt. It also condemns Israeli settler violence. In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that "(Mahmoud Abbas) is taking steps that will push negotiations farther away." Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The resolution says, "All Israeli settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, are illegal and constitute a major obstacle to the achievement of peace on the basis of the two-State solution." The Palestinians are planning to test the outgoing Obama administration with this draft, After the US vetoed a similarly-worded resolution in 2011. This draft resolution is moderate in comparison to the resolution put forth by the Palestinians five years ago, as it doesn't call for the establishment of a Palestinian state or for international protection. The UN Security Council. (Photo: AP) It is believed that this was done in order to make it harder for the US to use its veto power against this resolution. Adding to this is the fact that Washington has already intensified its rhetoric opposing construction in the West Bank recently. Despite this, a Palestinian political official noted that the final decision of whether or not to put the resolution to a vote at the UN Security Council hasn't been decided yet, although he said that as of now, it is very likely to happen. Abbas is expected to arrive in New York in two weeks for a three-day visit, in order to sign a climate change treaty According to this same Palestinian official, the feeling within the Palestinian Authority is that Abbas will in fact take advantage of his visit to New York in order to put forth the resolution at the Security Council and be present during the vote – if it happens. Political officials say that the Palestinians are looking for ways to embarrass Israel, and jumped at this opportunity to do it while Abbas is in New York. The Israeli UN delegation were unaware that the Palestinians were planning on putting forward this draft, but did notice that in the past few days there has been a lot of activity coming from the Palestinian delegation, and that the Israeli delegation alerted both the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister's office. Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon. "There are no shortcuts." (Photo: UN Photo/Cia Pak) Netanyahu's office itself published a strong response to the draft resolution, saying "(Mahmoud Abbas) is taking steps that will push negotiations farther away. The only way to push the peace process forward is through direct negotiations, something which (Abbas) is evading. The Palestinians teach their children every day that the settlements include Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Acre." Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said of the matter, "The Palestinians need to understand that there are no shortcuts. The only way to progress negotiations begins with condemning terror and stopping incitement, and ends in direct negotiations between the two sides. The Palestinians continue to try and deceive the international community by pushing forward initiatives which don't contribute anything to either side."

United Nations – The Palestinian U.N. Mission says it has circulated a proposed Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements to Arab nations. The draft was condemned Thursday by Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas “is taking a step that will push negotiations further away” to end the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Palestinians refused to provide any details of the resolution, but recalled the 14-1 vote on a Security Council resolution on settlements in February 2011. It was defeated by a U.S. veto. It would have condemned “illegal” Israeli settlements and demanded an immediate halt to all settlement building. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War and built settlements there. The Palestinians claim those areas as parts of a future state.

A Palestinian official said Friday that a draft proposal for a new UN Security Council resolution seeks “accountability” for Israeli settlement building. Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Riyad al-Malki said the draft stresses the “violence and terrorism of the settlers.” The international community considers the settlements illegitimate while Israel says settlements and other core issues such as security should be resolved in peace talks. The draft resolution, already distributed to Arab nations at the UN in New York, was immediately condemned by Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who said Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas “is taking a step that will push negotiations further away” to end the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Palestinians refused to provide any details of the text, but said the Security Council has unanimously agreed that Israeli settlements are illegal and it is their responsibility to act on this assessment and adopt a resolution on settlements. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms They recalled the Security Council’s 14-1 vote on a resolution on settlements in February 2011. It was defeated by a US veto. That resolution would have condemned “illegal” Israeli settlements and demanded an immediate halt to all settlement building. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Six Day war and built settlements there. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, but nearly 600,000 Israeli settlers remain in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Peace Now, a dovish Israeli group that tracks settlement construction, said Israel began building 1,800 new settlement homes in the West Bank in 2015. Advertisement The Palestinians claim the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem as parts of a future state, a position that has wide global support. They view Israeli settlement construction as illegal and a major obstacle to resolving the conflict. Though Israel’s closest ally, the United States has nonetheless opposed new settlements, saying they are an impediment to peace between Israel and the Palestinians. At the same time, the Obama administration in 2011 didn’t want the Security Council to take up the issue, arguing it would complicate peace negotiations. Whether the US administration would adhere to that position and veto a similar resolution if it was put to a vote in the coming weeks remains to be seen. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which first reported on the resolution, said the Palestinians want the Security Council to vote when Abbas is in New York on April 22 to attend the high-level ceremony where more than 130 countries are expected to sign the landmark climate agreement reached in Paris in December. Netanyahu accused Abbas of avoiding direct negotiations, and Israel’s UN Ambassador Danny Danon said the only way to promote negotiations must start with the Palestinians “condemning terrorism and stopping the incitement.” “They are continuing to deceive the international community by putting forward initiatives that do nothing to better the lives of either side of this conflict,” Danon said.

The Palestinian mission to the United Nations is circulating a Security Council draft resolution which condemns Israel’s illegal settlements in the occupied territories. The mission said on Thursday that it had begun circulating the resolution among UN members and were discussing the text with a number of Arab countries. The Palestinians refused to provide any details of the text, but said the Security Council has unanimously agreed that Israeli settlements are illegal. Israel’s Haaretz daily said the proposal distributed by the Palestinians resembles the February 2011 resolution on the same topic, which was torpedoed by the US. That document called for the condemnation of Israel’s "illegal" settlements as well as an immediate halt in the regime’s construction activities in the occupied Palestinian lands. The draft gathered an overwhelming support of 14 out of the Security Council’s 15 members. Haaretz cited diplomatic sources as saying that the new draft resolution includes a clause condemning Israeli settler violence against Palestinians. Senior officials of the Palestinian Authority have already approached council member states to gauge potential support, including France, Spain and Egypt. Sources say Israel fears US President Barack Obama may no longer wish to veto the resolution calling for end to settlement construction. The Haaretz report also said the Palestinians want the 15-member council to vote on the resolution when Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas visits New York on April 22. The proposal has angered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who accused Abbas of undermining the so-called peace efforts.

The regime is under fire even by its own allies for its land grab polices. The Israeli NGO, Peace Now, which tracks and opposes the expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, says Israel began building 1,800 new settler units in the occupied West Bank in 2015. On March 17, the European Union censured the Israeli regime for its plans to expropriate Palestinian lands in the West Bank, saying the decision risks threatening the chances of ending the conflict in the occupied territories and creation of a future independent Palestinian state. Britain has also slammed Israel’s decision to further expand settlements in the West Bank, calling the move “an obstacle to peace.” More than half a million Israelis live in over 230 illegal settlements built since the 1967 Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories in the West Bank and East al-Quds (Jerusalem). Meanwhile, new reports say Tel Aviv has resumed construction work on a section of its Apartheid Wall separating parts of the West Bank from the bulk of the occupied territory. Tel Aviv said it wanted to prevent Palestinians from infiltrating into the Israeli settlements, but Palestinians consider the move as yet another violation of their rights. The wall’s presence in the occupied Palestinian territories has been condemned by the United Nations and the International Court of Justice. Israel ups demolition of Palestinian structures Recent figures released by the United Nations show the Israeli military has more than tripled the demolitions of Palestinian structures in the occupied West Bank over the past three months. Figures collated by the UN’s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (OCHA) said the average Israeli demolitions have risen to 165 on a monthly basis since January. The data further showed there 235 of such cases in February alone, up from an average of 50 demolitions a month in 2012-2015. Houses, Bedouin tents, livestock pens, outhouses and schools have been among the structures destroyed by the Tel Aviv regime. The demolitions also include humanitarian structures erected by the European Union (EU) to help those affected by earlier such destruction. The demolitions have raised alarm among diplomats and human rights groups over what they regard as the Tel Aviv regime’s continued violation of international law. Catherine Cook, an OCHA official based in al-Quds (Jerusalem) who monitors the demolitions, has described the situation as the worst since the UN body started collecting figures in 2009. “It is a very marked and worrying increase,” Catherine said, adding, “The hardest hit are Bedouin and Palestinian farming communities who are at risk of forcible transfer, which is a clear violation of international law.” On Thursday, Israeli military forces demolished a number of Palestinian structures across the occupied territories. They also razed a car spray painting workshop in the central West Bank town of Ni’lin, located 17 kilometers (11 miles) west of Ramallah, leaving some 15 Palestinians working there jobless. Meanwhile, Ghassan Daghlas, Palestinian official monitoring settlement activities in the northern part of the West Bank, has said the Israeli forces have destroyed more than 500 Palestinian structures since the beginning of the current year.

A draft resolution by the Palestinian Authority distributed to UN members last week calls for the immediate resumption of peace talks with Israel and a final status agreement within a year, as well as a complete halt to all Israeli settlement activity. A copy of the resolution was posted to the UN Report blog on Friday. Israeli daily Haaretz, which first reported on the resolution, said the Palestinians want the Security Council to vote when PA President Mahmoud Abbas is in New York on April 22 for a high-level signing ceremony for the landmark climate agreement reached in Paris in December. Dozens of international politicians are expected to attend the ceremony. The UN draft calls on “all parties to exert collective efforts to launch credible negotiations on all final status issues in the Middle East peace process according to its agreed terms of reference and within the time frame specified by the Quartet [of Mideast peacemakers] in its statement of 21 September 2010.” In the above-mentioned 2010 statement, the Quartet stated that Israeli-Palestinian negotiations could resolve all final status issues within one year. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The draft begins by reiterating the Palestinian demand that Israel “immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including East Jerusalem,” which it calls Israel’s “legal obligations in this regard.” The draft singles out Israeli settlers, calling for the prevention of “all acts of terror, violence, destruction, harassment and provocation by Israeli settlers, and calls for accountability for the perpetration of all such illegal actions.” While making no specific mention of Palestinian terrorism, the draft also calls for both parties “to refrain from provocative actions, incitement and inflammatory rhetoric, with the aim, inter alia, of de-escalating the situation on the ground, rebuilding trust and confidence, demonstrating through policies and actions a genuine commitment to the two-state solution, and creating the conditions necessary for promoting peace.” Advertisement The text also urged the acceleration of international and regional diplomatic efforts to reach a solution. In this regard, the draft stressed the importance of the Arab Peace Initiative. First endorsed by the Arab League in 2002, that initiative proposed a complete end to the Arab-Israeli conflict — including normalization of Israel’s relations with all Arab states — in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from land conquered in the 1967 Six Day War, as well as “just solution” to the Palestinian refugee issue. Israel initially rejected the initiative over a series of highly fatal Palestinian terror attacks around the time it was proposed. In recent years, however, Israeli officials have since expressed more interest in the initiative, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “This initiative is 13 years old, and the situation in the Middle East has changed since it was first proposed. But the general idea — to try and reach understandings with leading Arab countries — is a good idea,” Netanyahu said last May. The Palestinian UN draft did not mention the ongoing French initiative to restart peace talks. Advertisement The international community considers Israeli settlements illegitimate, while Israel says settlements and other core issues such as security should be resolved in peace talks. Netanyahu condemned the UN draft last Thursday, accusing Abbas of “taking a step that will push negotiations further away.” The UN Security Council last voted to condemn Israeli settlements in February 2011. That resolution was broadly supported in a 14-1 vote, but was defeated by a US veto. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in the 1967 war and built settlements there. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005; 600,000 Israeli Jews live in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Raphael Ahren, Times of Israel Staff and AP contributed to this report.

News article:
UNITED NATIONS - The Israeli and Palestinian ambassadors engaged in a rare shouting match in the UN Security Council on Monday, reflecting Israel's growing consternation at the upsurge in Palestinian attacks against civilians and Palestinian frustration at the failure to achieve its dream of a truly independent state. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Israel's Ambassador Danny Danon started the heated exchange at the end of his speech during Monday's monthly council meeting on the Middle East. Looking across the council table at Palestinian envoy Riyad Mansour, he demanded: "Will you condemn Palestinians who commit terror attacks against Israelis?" Israel's Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon (Photo: UN/Cia Pak) Mansour, whose initial response was not heard because his microphone was off, retorted when it was turned on: "We condemn the killing of all innocent civilians including Palestinian civilians. Do you do the same?" During Israel's war against Gaza militants in 2014, more than 2,200 Palestinians were killed, including hundreds of civilians, according to UN figures. Since the current wave of unrest began in September, Palestinian attackers have killed 29 Israelis and four foreign nationals and at least 189 Palestinians have been killed. On Monday, a bus exploded in Jerusalem wounding 21 people in what police were calling a "terror attack." Palestinians have accused Israel of using excessive force against assailants, and in some cases, killing innocent civilians. Neither Danon nor Mansour got an answer to their initial question, but the Israeli ambassador wasn't giving up. Danon accused the Palestinians of teaching "hatred" in schools and naming streets after "terrorists" and demanded that these practices stop. "You pay the families of terrorists," he said. "You glorify terrorism. Shame on you for doing that." Mansour shot back: "We don't." Palestinian Ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour (Photo: EPA) Danon, undeterred, went on: "Shame on you for glorifying terrorism." Mansour retorted: "Shame on you for killing thousands of Palestinian children." After another heated exchange, China's UN Ambassador Liu Jieyi banged his gavel and told the Israeli ambassador to continue with his statement. But Danon ignored him, again shouting at Mansour saying: "You cannot condemn terrorism. You cannot say it here ... Shame on you for not being able to say it." Mansour responded but his microphone was turned off. When it was turned on, he shouted back: "Let my people be free. You are occupiers. You are colonizers. Leave us alone." The Israeli-Palestinian exchange followed a briefing to the Security Council by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon who said the latest killings "have only deepened the divisiveness, hatred and grief" on both sides. Mansour said the Palestinians are moving ahead on a Security Council resolution that would address Israeli settlements in the West Bank and aim at de-escalating the volatile situation, rebuilding trust and moving toward "a just, lasting, comprehensive peace." Danon reiterated that when the Palestinians end their "campaign of hate and violence," and teach respect for all people in their schools, "they will find a partner ready to work with them for the promise of peace." China's Wang, obviously annoyed at the shouting match, urged all to speakers to "keep order in this chamber in order to reflect the solemnity of the question we are discussing."

UNITED NATIONS - The Israeli and Palestinian ambassadors engaged in a rare shouting match in the UN Security Council on Monday, reflecting Israel's growing consternation at the upsurge in Palestinian attacks against civilians and Palestinian frustration at the failure to achieve its dream of a truly independent state. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Israel's Ambassador Danny Danon started the heated exchange at the end of his speech during Monday's monthly council meeting on the Middle East. Looking across the council table at Palestinian envoy Riyad Mansour, he demanded: "Will you condemn Palestinians who commit terror attacks against Israelis?" Israel's Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon (Photo: UN/Cia Pak) Mansour, whose initial response was not heard because his microphone was off, retorted when it was turned on: "We condemn the killing of all innocent civilians including Palestinian civilians. Do you do the same?" During Israel's war against Gaza militants in 2014, more than 2,200 Palestinians were killed, including hundreds of civilians, according to UN figures. Since the current wave of unrest began in September, Palestinian attackers have killed 29 Israelis and four foreign nationals and at least 189 Palestinians have been killed. On Monday, a bus exploded in Jerusalem wounding 21 people in what police were calling a "terror attack." Palestinians have accused Israel of using excessive force against assailants, and in some cases, killing innocent civilians. Neither Danon nor Mansour got an answer to their initial question, but the Israeli ambassador wasn't giving up. Danon accused the Palestinians of teaching "hatred" in schools and naming streets after "terrorists" and demanded that these practices stop. "You pay the families of terrorists," he said. "You glorify terrorism. Shame on you for doing that." Mansour shot back: "We don't." Palestinian Ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour (Photo: EPA) Danon, undeterred, went on: "Shame on you for glorifying terrorism." Mansour retorted: "Shame on you for killing thousands of Palestinian children." After another heated exchange, China's UN Ambassador Liu Jieyi banged his gavel and told the Israeli ambassador to continue with his statement. But Danon ignored him, again shouting at Mansour saying: "You cannot condemn terrorism. You cannot say it here ... Shame on you for not being able to say it." Mansour responded but his microphone was turned off. When it was turned on, he shouted back: "Let my people be free. You are occupiers. You are colonizers. Leave us alone."

Israeli-Palestinian shouting match at UN Security Council A UN Security Council debate turned into a shouting match on Monday between the Israeli and Palestinian ambassadors, who exchanged cries of "Shame on you!" over ongoing violence. Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon broke away from his address to the council and demanded that the Palestinian representative condemn acts of terrorism -- the term he used to describe Palestinian attacks on Israelis. "Shame on you for glorifying terrorism!" Danon said. Danny Danon, Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations, demanded that the Palestinian representative condemn acts of terrorism ©Mark Garten (United Nations/AFP/File) "Shame on you for killing Palestinian children!" Riyad Mansour shot back. After being called to order by the council president, Danon once again turned to Mansour and hammered: "You cannot say it here. Palestinian children are looking at you right now." "'I condemn all acts of terrorism': one sentence you cannot say. Shame on you for that," he pressed on. "Let my people be free! Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you! You are an occupier," Mansour hit back. The council debate took place as the Palestinians pushed for a UN resolution demanding that Israel halt the construction of settlements in the Palestinian territories. The draft resolution is being negotiated with Arab countries and has yet to be formally circulated to the council, but the United States -- which vetoed a similar resolution in 2011 -- has said it "will consider all options" over the Israeli-Palestinian effort. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in an address that Israeli demolitions of Palestinian buildings in the West Bank were continuing at "an alarming rate," reasserting that settlements are illegal. The latest surge of violence over the past six months has killed some 30 Israelis and 200 Palestinians, with most of the Palestinians killed while carrying out knife, gun or car-ramming attacks, Ban said. The United Nations supports a two-state solution in the Middle East, with Israel and Palestine both recognized countries, and the expansion of Israeli settlements is seen as undermining that plan. "Tragically, this solution seems more distant than it has for many decades," Ban said. The Middle East quartet -- comprised of the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia -- is working on a report about how to restart peace efforts. France is pushing for an international conference to jumpstart negotiations.

News article:
Ramallah: The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) plans to adopt the Jordanian or US currencies instead of the Israeli shekel in the Palestinian commerce and daily transactions as part of the PNA’s strategy to gradually decrease coordination with Israel reaching a point of cutting off relations with the occupier. According to Dr Nabeel Sha’ath, a key aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Monetary Authority and Ministry of Finance and Economy are quietly considering and studying abandoning the Israeli shekel in the Palestinian territories. Dr Sha’ath who is also Fatah Central Committee member and Fatah Commissioner of International Relations told the Palestinian Radio on Wednesday that the Palestinians, as per the agreements signed with Israel, could use the US dollar or the Jordanian dinar in their commerce and transactions, but the Palestinians with the passage of time mainly used the Israeli shekel. He stressed that the Israelis insist on using only the shekel in their commerce with the Palestinians and categorically refuse to do any business with the use of the US currency. Therefore, he said, it was time to abandon the Israeli shekel in Palestine. Over the past decades, the Palestinians have mainly used the Israeli shekel for commerce, but had considered reissuing the defunct Palestine pound as a key aspect of statehood. The Palestinians had found that this was unrealistic as they could not function independently of Israel. “We fully support abandoning the Israeli shekel from the daily life of Palestinians,” said Dr Nasr Abdul Kareem, an expert economist in the West Bank. “Adopting another currency in Palestine is just a right position but that should be done gradually, quietly and realistically.” He stressed that adopting a new currency in Palestine should be carefully considered and implemented where the Palestinian economy must be restructured giving the residents the chance to settle their shekel transactions. “Four billion shekels in salary income of the Palestinian workers in Israel in addition to four more billion shekels trade volume between Israel and the Palestinians should be carefully tackled,” he told Gulf News. “The Israeli reaction to the suspension of the shekel and adoption of another currency must also be carefully reviewed and evaluated in advance. Israel can easily impose collective economic punitive measures against the Palestinians.” Dr Abdul Kareem, who is sceptical that the Palestinians can instantly abandon the shekel as this can further increase the instability of the Palestinian economy, said the Palestinian banks are closely tied to their Israeli counterparts which constitute the only window to the world, given the fact that most of the Palestinian banks do not have branches abroad. “Abandoning the Israeli shekel and adopting another currency will and should take a long time — three to four years — and should be implemented gradually,” he said. Politically, abandoning the shekel is a fundamental move in the process of cutting relations with Israel and Palestinian politicians believe that the damage caused by the way the Israeli ruling coalition treats the Palestinians is more severe than the dangers from currency. The Palestinians are optimistic to manage the currency shift successfully and with no relative implications.

By Louis Charbonneau UNITED NATIONS, April 22 (Reuters) - The Palestinian president and Israel's ambassador to the United Nations traded barbs on Friday during a signing ceremony for the Paris climate accord, in the latest example of continuing Israeli-Palestinian tensions. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who signed the agreement on behalf of the Palestinians, took advantage of the presence of some 60 world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly to criticize Israel. "The Israeli occupation is destroying the climate in Palestine, and the Israeli settlements are destroying the environment in Palestine," Abbas told the 193-nation assembly. "Please help us in putting an end to the occupation and to settlements." Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded sharply when he addressed the ceremony, in which 175 states signed and 15 ratified the Paris accord. "Instead of spreading hatred here at the U.N., President Abbas should act to stop Palestinian terror," he said after signing the treaty. "This climate summit is supposed to be a demonstration of global unity for the sake of the future of our planet," he added. "Unfortunately, President Abbas chose to exploit this international stage to mislead the international community." Earlier this week, Danon and Palestinian envoy Riyad Mansour yelled "shame on you" at each other during a regular U.N. Security Council meeting on the situation in the Middle East. That meeting turned into a rare shouting match. U.S.-brokered Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been in tatters since 2014. Abbas' presence at the signing ceremony had symbolic importance in the wake of Palestine's de facto recognition of statehood by the United Nations, which since 2012 has considered Palestine a non-member observer state. It was the first time a Palestinian president sat in the General Assembly hall as a state party to a treaty at a signing ceremony. Palestine's accession to the treaty could lead to complications for the United States, which has a law barring U.S. funding for "any organization or group that does not have the internationally recognized attributes of statehood." U.S. senators sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry saying that Palestine's participation in the U.N. climate change secretariat and the Paris agreement would prohibit the United States from paying money into a global climate fund. The letter, signed by 21 Republican Senators, was the latest attempt by Congressional Republicans to block U.S. participation in global climate initiatives. The U.S. State Department said it received the letter and was preparing a response. Five years ago the United States stopped funding UNESCO, the U.N. cultural agency, after it granted the Palestinians full membership.

News article:
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A renewed Palestinian drive to persuade the U.N. Security Council to condemn Israeli settlements is aimed at removing the biggest obstacle to peace and boosting French efforts to broker an agreement, the Palestinian U.N. envoy said on Tuesday. Riyad Mansour, permanent Palestinian observer to the United Nations, told a small group of reporters that Arab delegations have received the draft resolution. He said the point of putting the draft about Israeli settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank forward was “to keep the hope alive, to remove this obstacle from the path of peace, to open doors for peace, (and) to try to help the French initiative to stand on its feet.” With U.S. efforts to broker a two-state solution in tatters since 2014 and Washington focused on this year’s election, France has been lobbying countries to commit to a conference that would get Israelis and Palestinians back to negotiations about ending their conflict. Mansour said Washington vetoed a similar resolution about Israel’s settlements five years ago because of fears it would undermine peace talks. But now, he noted, there are no peace talks. In February 2011, the United States voted against a draft resolution condemning Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory, though it said at the time its opposition should not be misunderstood as support for settlement activity. The United States considers Israeli settlements on land the Palestinians want for a future state to be illegitimate. Washington has not offered substantive comment on the new Palestinian draft, which has fueled speculation in Israeli media the United States is undecided about whether to use its veto this time. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will be in New York next week to sign the Paris climate agreement. He is expected to meet with French President Francois Hollande on the sidelines, diplomats say, and will likely discuss the Palestinian draft resolution. So far Egypt, the sole Arab council member, has not formally introduced the text. Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon last week reacted sharply to Israeli media reports about a possible Palestinian draft resolution on settlements. “The Palestinians must understand that there are no shortcuts,” he said in a statement. “The only way to promote negotiations starts by them condemning terrorism and stopping the incitement, and ends with direct negotiations between the two sides.”

News article:
The West’s refusal to challenge the growing corruption and autocratic rule of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas “could have a devastating effect on the long- prospects for a viable Palestinian state,” Grant Rumley, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, wrote Monday in Newsweek. As long as Abbas continues security cooperation with Israel and “pay[s] lip service to the moribund peace process,” Western leaders will not pressure him to change, Rumley observed. He added Abbas “has tested the limits of Western leniency” since the end of the American-sponsored talks two years ago, which Abbas himself torpedoed. Rumley raised concerns that Abbas, who is in the 11th year of a four-year term, is becoming increasingly dictatorial. Last month, Abbas established a new constitutional court, all of whose members are picked by Abbas, “that would, naturally, confirm his own presidential decrees,” Rumley wrote. When a Palestinian legislator accused an Abbas ally of corruption in March, Abbas issued a warrant for her arrest. When teachers launched an unprecedented strike over the PA’s broken promises to raise their wages, the PA set up roadblocks to prevent the teachers from marching on Ramallah, arrested the leaders of the teachers’ union, and threatened legal action unless they returned to work. The crackdown prompted one Palestinian journalist to write that the PA “really should not continue to exist.” And a recent report from a Palestinian NGO found that in 2015, 60 percent of the nearly 200 violations of press freedom in Palestinian territories occurred in the PA-governed West Bank, with only 40 percent occurring in Hamas-ruled Gaza. With Abbas sensing little interest from the White House in pursuing bilateral talks, Abbas is using the final year of President Barack Obama’s term in office as an opportunity for the “consolidation of power at home” and to “further isolate Israel,” Rumley wrote. But the indulgence Abbas has been given to grow increasingly autocratic comes at a price—”a devastating effect on the long-term prospects for a viable Palestinian state.” Rumley concluded: As one former Bush administration officialremarked in 2013, Palestinian self-governance—with free and fair elections—were “a powerful argument that it was time for Israel to stop governing Palestinians.” In other words, Abbas’s increasingly tyrannical government in the West Bank does not only handicap political expression—it also sets back the very legitimacy of the Palestinian national project. Other experts have raised concerns about the PA’s corruption and its effect on the viability of a future Palestinian state. In We Really Need to Talk About Corruption, which was published in the December 2013 issue of The Tower Magazine, Jonathan Schanzer observed: It seems clear that, despite being rejected by both the ballot and the gun, Abbas has failed to learn his lesson. He has failed to reform the dysfunctional Palestinian Authority, and does not show any signs of attempting to do so in the near future. And the West, addicted to top-down peacemaking, shows little interest in genuinely helping the Palestinian people attain a government dedicated to coexistence with Israel, nor one built on the open, fair and transparent civil society and legal system required to build a successful state. Similarly, in Terrorists and Kleptocrats: How Corruption is Eating the Palestinians Alive, which was published in the June 2014 issue of The Tower Magazine, Aaron Menenberg wrote: Through the PA, a small group of elites has concentrated power and wealth, estranging the Palestinian people from its government and insulating the government from the people. Sadly, foreign attempts to aid the Palestinians are subject to the same regime, with devastating consequences. The attempt to use foreign aid to the PA as both a carrot and a stick has not closed the gap between the Palestinian people and their government. Rather, it has helped widen it. American and European support for the Palestinian Authority now totals hundreds of billions of dollars—possibly trillions if non-governmental activities are included. With that money, we have helped build an elite-run system that bludgeons the entrepreneurial Sammys and marginalizes the pragmatic Izzats. Not a lot of Westerners get to see this dynamic from the inside, and that is a shame. Much of the foreign support for the Palestinians is given with the best of intentions. This makes those who question it susceptible to all manner of criticism. That this questioning is often warranted, however, escapes many supporters and financiers of the Palestinian Authority, because it contradicts the comfortable mainstream narrative that reinforces their motivation.

The West’s refusal to challenge the growing corruption and autocratic rule of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas “could have a devastating effect on the long- prospects for a viable Palestinian state,” Grant Rumley, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, wrote Monday in Newsweek. As long as Abbas continues security cooperation with Israel and “pay[s] lip service to the moribund peace process,” Western leaders will not pressure him to change, Rumley observed. He added Abbas “has tested the limits of Western leniency” since the end of the American-sponsored talks two years ago, which Abbas himself torpedoed. Rumley raised concerns that Abbas, who is in the 11th year of a four-year term, is becoming increasingly dictatorial. Last month, Abbas established a new constitutional court, all of whose members are picked by Abbas, “that would, naturally, confirm his own presidential decrees,” Rumley wrote. When a Palestinian legislator accused an Abbas ally of corruption in March, Abbas issued a warrant for her arrest. When teachers launched an unprecedented strike over the PA’s broken promises to raise their wages, the PA set up roadblocks to prevent the teachers from marching on Ramallah, arrested the leaders of the teachers’ union, and threatened legal action unless they returned to work. The crackdown prompted one Palestinian journalist to write that the PA “really should not continue to exist.” And a recent report from a Palestinian NGO found that in 2015, 60 percent of the nearly 200 violations of press freedom in Palestinian territories occurred in the PA-governed West Bank, with only 40 percent occurring in Hamas-ruled Gaza. With Abbas sensing little interest from the White House in pursuing bilateral talks, Abbas is using the final year of President Barack Obama’s term in office as an opportunity for the “consolidation of power at home” and to “further isolate Israel,” Rumley wrote. But the indulgence Abbas has been given to grow increasingly autocratic comes at a price—”a devastating effect on the long-term prospects for a viable Palestinian state.” Rumley concluded: As one former Bush administration officialremarked in 2013, Palestinian self-governance—with free and fair elections—were “a powerful argument that it was time for Israel to stop governing Palestinians.” In other words, Abbas’s increasingly tyrannical government in the West Bank does not only handicap political expression—it also sets back the very legitimacy of the Palestinian national project. Other experts have raised concerns about the PA’s corruption and its effect on the viability of a future Palestinian state. In We Really Need to Talk About Corruption, which was published in the December 2013 issue of The Tower Magazine, Jonathan Schanzer observed: It seems clear that, despite being rejected by both the ballot and the gun, Abbas has failed to learn his lesson. He has failed to reform the dysfunctional Palestinian Authority, and does not show any signs of attempting to do so in the near future. And the West, addicted to top-down peacemaking, shows little interest in genuinely helping the Palestinian people attain a government dedicated to coexistence with Israel, nor one built on the open, fair and transparent civil society and legal system required to build a successful state. Similarly, in Terrorists and Kleptocrats: How Corruption is Eating the Palestinians Alive, which was published in the June 2014 issue of The Tower Magazine, Aaron Menenberg wrote: Through the PA, a small group of elites has concentrated power and wealth, estranging the Palestinian people from its government and insulating the government from the people. Sadly, foreign attempts to aid the Palestinians are subject to the same regime, with devastating consequences. The attempt to use foreign aid to the PA as both a carrot and a stick has not closed the gap between the Palestinian people and their government. Rather, it has helped widen it. American and European support for the Palestinian Authority now totals hundreds of billions of dollars—possibly trillions if non-governmental activities are included. With that money, we have helped build an elite-run system that bludgeons the entrepreneurial Sammys and marginalizes the pragmatic Izzats. Not a lot of Westerners get to see this dynamic from the inside, and that is a shame. Much of the foreign support for the Palestinians is given with the best of intentions. This makes those who question it susceptible to all manner of criticism. That this questioning is often warranted, however, escapes many supporters and financiers of the Palestinian Authority, because it contradicts the comfortable mainstream narrative that reinforces their motivation. Meanwhile, the PA is as corrupt as ever, and uses our foreign aid to literally sell its people short. The gap between the Palestinian people and their leadership is nothing less than catastrophic, and it will not be closed unless donors change the way they support the Palestinian Authority. A good first step would be to tie aid to greater PA transparency and responsibility to the Palestinian people. Donors should also insist on fiscal and legal reforms, as well as the establishment of robust and independent institutions—judiciary and education included.

Venezuelan Ambassador to the UN Rafael Ramirez accused Israel of implementing a "final solution" against the Palestinians in the UN Security Council on Friday. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter "Is Israel trying to impose a 'final solution' on the Palestinians in the West Bank?" Ramirez asked at the Security Council meeting. Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon immediately condemned the statement, and Ramirez apologized to "the Jewish people, if they were offended by my statement." The declaration occurred while the Yesh Din organization was presenting statistics pertaining to law enforcement as it relates to crimes of an ideological nature carried out by Israeli citizens against Palestinians, and the effects of the lack of law enforcement on the Palestinians who live in the West Bank to the UN Security Council. Venezuelan Ambassador to the UN Rafael Ramirez Yesh Din representative Michael Sfard also presented the organization's assertion that the violence carried out against Palestinians is designed to drive them off of their land. The Venezuelan ambassador asked, "What is Israel planning to do with the Palestinians? Do the Israelis want the Palestinians to disappear? Is Israel preparing a 'final solution' for the Palestinians similar to what was done to them?" Sfarad condemned the Venezuelan ambassador's statements. Israeli Ambassador Danon responded harshly to Ramirez's statements, "These are blunt anti-Semitic statements coming from the Venezuelan ambassador towards the Jewish nation. The ambassador's statements are a continuation of the Palestinian representative's statements which equated Israel to the Nazis only a few days ago. The Palestinians are bringing anti-Semitism to the UN and are bringing the language of racism to the world parliament." The Israeli UN delegation immediately turned to the members of the UN Security Council bodies to condemn these strong statements. The US, Britain, and France decisively condemned the Venezuelan ambassador's statements.

News article:
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s offer to teach history to UN personnel was rejected by the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process on Saturday, Nickolay Mladenov. On Friday, Netanyahu stated that he was shocked that UNESCO would adopt “a decision denying any Jewish connection to the Temple Mount, our holiest site.” “That is why today I am announcing a seminar on Jewish history for all UN personnel in Israel,” he said in a statement. “I will personally host the lecture at the Prime Minister’s Office,” said Netanyahu, noting that it would be delivered by a “leading scholar of Jewish history.” He also invited to the lecture diplomats “of countries which voted for this outrageous decision”. Mladenov responded by declining the offer. “If someone wants to issue invitations they should be for Paris and addressed to the ambassadors of the member-states of UNESCO there,” he said in a statement. “UN staff in Jerusalem know the history of the region, its people and religions all too well.” The Prime Minister’s offer comes in response to recent UNESCO resolutions referring to Israel as an “occupying power”. The UNESCO resolutions also claim several sites holy to Judaism as Muslim sites. The resolutions refer to the Temple Mount as Al-Haram al-Sharif and Al-Aqsa Mosque. It refers to Al-Buraq Plaza, with ‘Western Wall’ in parentheses. The resolution was approved by 33 states, including France, Russia, Spain and Sweden. Seventeen countries abstained while six voted against including the United States, Estonia, Germany, Lithuania, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

News article:
Hamas has quickly learned the lessons of the 2014 Operation Protective Edge and has been hard at work recovering its strength, a high-ranked IDF officer said Thursday. However, the Gaza terror organization has yet to restore its rockets arsenal to the same quantity and quality as before the war, it is hindered by a shortage in supply of arms and raw materials, and suffers from increasing tensions between its military and political branches. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter During a briefing to the media, a the senior IDF officer revealed some of the military's plans for a future conflict in Gaza. He also described a situation very similar to the period before the outbreak of Operation Protective Edge: Hamas in Gaza is pushing for an escalation of violence and trying to execute terror bombings in the West Bank - but is not interested in a confrontation with Israel in the Strip itself. At the same time, Hamas is dedicating most of its time and resources to restoring its military strength and further bolstering its forces. "Hamas is suspicious of Israel, fearing that it will initiate a surprise attack on the Gaza Strip, which is why we're concerned that Hamas will miscalculate the situation," the officer said. "They're highly-sensitive about any statements made on our side." Palestinian terrorists firing rockets at Israel (Photo: AFP/File) Thirty-five rockets have been fired from Gaza at Israel since the end of Operation Protective Edge by other factions in the Strip. Most of these rockets either fell in open areas or were intercepted. Hamas, the official said, was quick to arrest those who violated the ceasefire. "Hamas has established a border-protecting unit that enforces the ceasefire ad prevents terror attacks against Israel," he said. "Even when roadside bombs went off - the last of which on Friday was an old IED - they were planted by other factions," he said. "Hamas sends us messages that it is working to stop attacks against us, that it remains restrained and that it is not interested in escalating the situation in the area because it is busy rehabilitating itself and the Strip. This view is shared by the IDF and other security forces, but we're not confused by it." Hamas's military leadership is more dominant now, challenging the political leadership at every turn and turning them into mere figureheads. A good demonstration of that was in recent weeks when the military wing - commanded by Mohammed Deif, his deputy Marwan Issa, who is responsible for communications with the political leadership, and Yahya Sanwar, who was released as part of the Shalit deal and is largely seen as Hamas's "defense minister" - executed one of the organization's battalion commanders without seeking the approval of the political leadership - raising the ire of Hamas leader Khaled Mashal. Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif challenges the organization's political leadership (Photo: EPA) "The lessons the military wing learned from Operation Protective Edge is that they should not have listened to the political leadership as much as they did, because the political bureau failed to reach any achievements in the war," the official explained. "They also claim Hamas's political leadership limited them when it came to surprise attacks against Israel." "You can't ignore the strength of the military wing in the Strip, which is supporting ISIS in the Sinai and making a series of appointments that are not to the liking of the political leadership," he added. Investing in drones The Military Intelligence Directorate has reported that the Hamas was investing a lot of time and resources in training its Nukhba force - the elite unit that will be sent to execute "quality operations" against Israel, like strategic bombings. The Nukhba unit has grown since the summer of 2014 and now numbers 5,000 fighters - out of Hamas's overall 20,000. Hamas is also investing in the training of its naval commando unit as part of the lessons learned from Operation Protective Edge, when that unit tried to infiltrated the Zikim beach, was spotted by IDF lookouts, and gunned down. Now, the commando unit has far more divers than it had before. Furthermore, Hamas is investing in the development of drones - with funds and knowhow from Iran. When it comes to its production of rockets, Hamas has been hindered by a shortage of raw materials, mostly because the Egyptian military destroyed most of the smuggling tunnels connecting the Gaza Strip to the Sinai Peninsula. This has been making it harder on the terror group to restock its arsenal. Still, Hamas continues testing and developing rockets by firing middle- and long-range rockets into the sea in an effort to bypass the Iron Dome missile-defense system. Hamas trying to challenge the Iron Dome missile-defense system (Photo: Herzl Yosef) At the same time, Hamas is developing mortar shells and short-range rockets with very big payloads that could reach 150-200 kilograms per warhead - the kind of which they did not have before. Hamas chose to direct its resources thus as most of the Israelis killed by rocket fire during Operation Protective Edge were hit by the short-range fire to the border communities. In addition, Israel is limited when it comes to providing sufficient warning of short-range rockets, and limited in their interception. However, "Hamas is not yet mass producing these mortar shells because of its difficulties in getting raw materials," the senior officer said. In addition, the IDF has cautioned about continued attempts by Hamas to establish cells to attack Israel during war time from different fronts - including Lebanon and the Sinai, aided by ISIS militants in the peninsula. Israel, the IDF officer noted, "has an interest in the Egyptian army defeating ISIS and not losing its control over northern Sinai. They're already operating against the smuggling to the Gaza Strip. We've approved most of their requests to bring land and air forces into the Sinai, temporarily, but some requests - like bringing artillery into the peninsula - were denied." According to the IDF officer, there are three factors that could lead to the renewal of fighting in the south: One of the sides wrongly reading the situation because of a specific incident or declaration, escalation in light of incidents in the West Bank, and the Palestinians tiring of the Israeli military blockade and rising up against it. 'Aerial attacks will be more significant' In order to prepare for a possible renewal of fighting, the IDF's top echelons have recently approved an operative plan to fighting in the Gaza Strip, formulated by the Southern Command. "We have a plan to defeat Hamas's military wing based on different parameters that have been determined," the officer said. "Each of our battalions fighting on its way to its target will kill as many Hamas militants and damage as much of the organization's infrastructure as possible. The aim is to end the next campaign with Hamas's abilities set back by years. The plan is based on strong protection of the Gaza border communities, which will be done by the Gaza Division, while the IDF's gathering areas will be located far from the mortar shell threat." The senior IDF officer further stated that "defeating Hamas will be achieved by offense, not defense, so we can initiate and not get dragged into it, not react to the enemy's moves. We need to surprise the enemy, and do so with great force. In addition, the aerial attacks will be much more significant and effective. Not just bombing for the sake of bombing. The plan will allow for different options - from a deterring strike to the full capture of the Gaza Strip. The plan could develop to the most extreme directions, and will enable us to deliver a very hard blow to the organization’s military wing." Members of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades (Photo: AP) However, it's important to mention, the IDF currently sees no alternative ruler for the Gaza Strip as Hamas still enjoys the support of the Palestinian street. The senior officer said battalion commanders in the Southern Command have undergone a series of courses in different topics, including on how to defeat a Hamas battalion. "Each of our battalion commanders maneuvering in the Strip has a whole book about the battalion he'll fight against, including all of its details and characteristics," he said. The senior officer said the plan also takes into consideration the possibility of having to evacuate communities close to the Gaza border. This will be done in coordination with the regional councils, while some personnel will remain in the communities to do vital work and defend the empty homes. The plan includes allocating communities to take in the residents of the evacuated towns. In addition, pending financing promised by the government, the protection measures on the border fence will be increased in order to defend the nearby communities from mass protests on the fence of Palestinians trying to infiltrate Israel. With all of that in mind, the Southern Command stressed that "there are no tensions in the south at the moment. We evaluate our preparedness in the Gaza border area as strong. The assessment right now is that there is not going to be an escalation of hostilities on the southern border in the near future and that the current situation will continue. The IDF will continue assessing the situation. There has been an improvement in the intelligence gathering and in the troops' preparedness."

A senior Likud member of Knesset said Saturday that Hamas was deterred by the last round of fighting with Israel in 2014 but that it is gaining strength. Speaking on Channel 2 TV on Saturday, Tzachi Hanegbi, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and a close confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said the IDF was prepared for all possibilities, including grave ones, regarding possible new conflict with Gaza’s Islamist terror rulers. “It’s no secret that Hamas has not changed its ways. Although [the terror group] is deterred, it is gaining strength,” Hanegbi, who also serves as chairman of the government coalition, said Saturday. He added that “what’s more important is what the IDF is doing. And it is preparing for all possibilities, including grave, difficult ones. I can say that if there are provocations [from Hamas], we can count on [the IDF].” Hanegbi’s comments came amid fast-rising tensions along the Gaza Strip border, where Israel on Thursday carried out its largest civilian drill near the Palestinian enclave since 2014’s war between Israel and Hamas, according to a Channel 2 report Friday. Hanegbi’s remarks echoed comments made Thursday by the IDF’s Southern Command Maj. Gen.

The exercise, which was held at Kibbutz Erez, included troops overpowering the terrorists in the community’s dining hall. Participants in the drill included the army, the police, Magen David Adom medics, the fire department, civilian response teams and others. The report also said that although Israel believes Hamas does not want a new war now, the IDF has in recent days completed preparations for any outbreak of conflict. Advertisement It added that the army has boosted its deployment adjacent to the Gaza border in preparation for such an eventuality. On Thursday Palestinian media said IDF bulldozers entered the Gaza Strip and carried out work near the border fence. The Ma’an News Agency, citing eyewitnesses, reported that four bulldozers moved several meters into the southern Gaza Strip in an area east of the city of Rafah and began leveling ground near the border. Drones were seen flying overhead as the IDF earth-movers worked. According to Ma’an, it was the latest in over half a dozen similar incursions over the past ten days. A senior IDF officer told reporters Thursday that Hamas is amassing fighters and materiel at a “surprisingly” quick pace in Gaza but that the terror group does not appear to be prepared for renewed direct conflict with Israel in the near future. He stressed the terrorist organization would not again drag Israel into a war, and that any future conflict would be one undertaken at the initiative of the Jewish state. Advertisement His comments came a day after a senior Defense Ministry official indicated there is no expectation of an increase in violence with Hamas. “The good news is that our deterrence is still working,” said Amos Gilad, director of the ministry’s Political-Military Affairs Bureau, at a conference on the beleaguered coastal strip’s financial woes. “They say that there will be a ‘hot’ summer. That’ll only be because of the high temperatures,” he continued, alluding to the tendency for regional conflicts to take place in warmer summer months. “Economics alone can’t solve [Gaza’s problems]. Economics are not the fundamental solution,” Gilad said in his address. So long as Hamas rules the Gaza Strip, he added, there will not be peace there. Judah Ari Gross contributed to this report.

News article:
Eyeing a fresh round of violence with Israel, the Hamas terrorist organization is sparing no effort to enhance its arsenal and train its operatives, especially from the Gaza-ruling group’s elite “Nukhbah” terror unit, a senior officer with the Israel Defense Forces Southern Command told reporters Thursday. In a briefing with military correspondents, the officer said that Hamas’s special forces currently include some 20,000 operatives. Hamas also strives to develop its drone and naval capabilities, including terrorist divers, he said, adding that the terror group was actively pursuing improved rocket-launching capabilities. But Hamas has yet to rehabilitate its pre-2014 firing abilities, which were significantly crippled during Israel’s Operation Protective Edge. Hamas is currently focusing on developing its short-range projectile fire apparatus, which proved more effective during the summer 2014 war with Israel, as it challenged the Iron Dome missile defense system’s interceptors. The officer said the Islamist group was trying to increase the amount of explosives its arsenal of short-range projectiles can carry, as well as to develop mid-range rockets that could “escape” the Iron Dome. One of the innovations said to be in development are “barrel bombs” capable of packing up to 250 kilograms (550 pounds) of explosives. “There is concern of miscalculation on Gaza’s part, meaning Hamas suspects we are planning some sort of operation, therefore they’re on very high alert and they lend great importance to any statement by the IDF. They’re concerned we might strike Gaza to affect the situation in Judea and Samaria,” said the officer, adding, “Hamas saw the [months-long terror wave] in Judea and Samaria as a strategic opportunity it hoped to seize. It is very disappointed by the fact the situation in Judea and Samaria has stabilized.”

News article:
Residents of Gaza border towns, journalists and political opponents took Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud government to task Wednesday, accusing it of failing to address the threat of Hamas-dug attack tunnels from the Strip. The “The Threat of the Tunnels” conference, held in the southern town of Sderot, took on additional weight in light of the recent discovery of a tunnel that reached deep into Israeli territory from the southern Gaza Strip. On the issue of the tunnels, IDF Southern Command head Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir attempted to reassure the crowd that the army had things under control. “The period since Operation Protective Edge has been the most quiet period in a decade,” Zamir said, using the Israeli name for the war in Gaza in 2014. “The tunnels Hamas tries to build have become death traps for its operatives.” He was referring to a series of tunnel collapses throughout the Strip in recent weeks that have killed scores of Hamas men. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “We have detailed plans on how to respond to any Hamas aggression, and are operating constantly along the border,” he added. “In addition to preserving the quiet and preventing terror, we must prepare for war, with the understanding that the realities of the world can change,” Zamir said. Various high-ranking IDF officers and defense officials have stressed over the past week that though Hamas is rearming itself, there is no expectation of conflict in the near future. “As part of our preparations, an organized plan was created by the relevant bodies — the Defense Ministry, the IDF and local councils — to temporarily move residents away from the range of mortars and out of harm’s way,” Zamir also said. During the 2014 war, communities close to the border were evacuated for this exact reason, and a similar plan also exists for northern Israeli towns at risk of Hezbollah rocket attacks. Zamir’s comments — which echoed many statements expressed in the past week — were overshadowed by the political attacks on the government and Netanyahu’s Likud party, as well as the anger of the Sderot residents in attendance. Advertisement The heads of opposition parties — the Zionist Union’s Isaac Herzog, Yesh Atid’s Yair Lapid, Yisrael Beytenu’s Avigdor Liberman and Meretz’s Zehava Galon — spoke at the conference, offering their parties’ answers to the threat of attack tunnels. Likud, however, could only muster Miki Zohar, a freshman MK who is 22nd on the party’s list and is best known for proposing stricter legislation against businesses that remain open on Shabbat. Zohar’s appearance started poorly, with the event’s emcee, Channel 2 anchor Dany Cushmaro, lamenting that only an alternate member of the Knesset’s Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee came to the event from Likud. “We wanted someone who’s really a part of the coalition cabinet,” Cushmaro said during Zohar’s introduction. Things did not get better from there. Zohar’s speech was interrupted multiple times, first by audience members who demanded the government do more to protect them from Hamas, and then by Cushmaro himself, who derided the MK’s speech as light on content. The crowd is actively arguing with Micky Zohar. pic.twitter.com/8EGxCPNkot Advertisement — Judah Ari Gross (@JudahAriGross) April 20, 2016 “Every generation has its challenges,” Zohar said, and the only thing stopping the “challenge” of tunnels is Israel’s new detection technology. “That’s all you have to say?” Cushmaro asked. “I’ll give you my speech, and you can read it twice,” Zohar responded. The freshman MK trumpeted the new tunnel detection technology as a panacea for the threat of the tunnels and a feather in the cap of the government. “How was the tunnel found? Due to information? No, due to technology,” he said, stretching out his pronunciation of the last word. The army, meanwhile, has stressed that the still-secret tunnel detection system was only one part of the effort to discover the tunnel, with intelligence and “boots on the ground” playing an important role. “The left doesn’t like it when problems get solved,” Zohar added. Advertisement Col. (res.) Yossi Langotzky, who previously served as adviser to the IDF chief of staff on the threat of tunnels, called Zohar “an idiot” for his comments on tunnel detection technology. “Have a little responsibility, a little professionalism, a little citizenship,” Langotzky said on the sidelines of the conference. “Any physical barrier can be overcome.” The attacks on the government came not only in the form of direct challenges from audience members, who accused the party of holding back funds for the creation of a new superior barrier system, but also from other speakers, including former political allies of Netanyahu. Liberman, a staunch right-winger who once considered urging that Israel reconquer the Gaza Strip, chose a surprising avenue of attack. Advocating a lessening of some of the restrictions on imports and exports for the coastal enclave, the Yisrael Beytenu leader emphasized the importance of easing the economic crisis in Gaza, which he claimed has been fueling the conflict. “A better life for Gaza residents makes them less likely to join a terrorist organization like Hamas, and Hamas knows it,” Liberman said. The terrorist organization diverts funds and materials designated for the reconstruction of Gaza and uses it for its own nefarious means, he charged. Advertisement “What would I do if I had responsibility for this issue?” he asked rhetorically. “Open a TV station, radio station and website in the Strip to tell the [Gaza] population the truth about Hamas.” Galon, from the left-wing Meretz party, advocated a dramatic change in policy, one that puts more emphasis on the need for negotiations in place of violent conflict to resolve the issues coming from Gaza. For a decade Israel has had “the same policy and the same results,” Galon said. “This might sound ‘sensitive,’ but security isn’t just about military power, it’s about diplomacy,” she said. “Deterrence doesn’t last forever.” Lapid and Herzog dealt less with what should be done to resolve the threat of tunnels on the Israeli communities surrounding the Gaza Strip, and more with how the government has failed to do so. “If I were prime minister, the person initiating these tunnels wouldn’t stay alive,” Herzog said. He blasted the government and security cabinet as being short on action and long on word, as part of his recent bid to appear tough on terror. “I don’t think Hamas is deterred enough. They keep digging tunnels, which shows they’re not deterred,” Herzog said. A recording of the opposition leader telling Labor party members the party had to stop giving the impression “that we are always ‘Arab-lovers’” leaked Tuesday evening, prompting outrage and ridicule in the Israeli public. In response to the brewing scandal, Herzog told audience members at the Sderot conference the quote was out of context, that he was discussing how the party is seen by others.

News article:
April 26, 2016 Israel and Hamas have been escalating their war of words, which observers on both sides fear could turn into violence. Gaza has yet to recover from the destruction of the last war with Israel in the summer of 2014, when more than 178,000 houses were destroyed or damaged, which makes any upcoming war between Israel and the Palestinians seem too early and premature. After a flurry of contentious statements in February, the situation calmed in March as both Hamas and Israel stopped talking about a possible fourth Israeli-Gaza war, and both showed a desire to quiet their people and reassure them that no confrontation would break out anytime soon. But on April 14, an anonymous senior Israeli officer made an unprecedented statement about Israel Defense Forces (IDF) plans for the next potential military confrontation with Hamas in Gaza. Israeli media reported that the official was a prominent source from the IDF leadership in the southern area. The Israeli plan for a potential war against Hamas in Gaza received wide media coverage in the Palestinian and Israeli press. It calls for each Israeli battalion to kill as many Hamas members as possible and thwart the movement’s moves and goals. The IDF has developed a strong defense and attack system capable of protecting the Gaza envelope and minimizing the threat of mortar shells, while the Israeli air force would launch an extraordinary and efficient offensive. Abu Mujahid, a spokesman for the Popular Resistance Committees, told Al-Monitor, “The resistance in Gaza is preparing itself for the worst in its upcoming confrontation with the Israeli army. We take the IDF threats to launch a new war against Gaza very seriously. We have growing speculations that the Israeli enemy has begun the countdown for a new aggression against Gaza, and the resistance is getting prepared around the clock in order not to give the Israeli army a chance to launch a sudden attack.” Israel announced April 18 that it had discovered a new tunnel east of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, noting that the tunnel is 2 kilometers (1.24 miles) long, 30 meters (almost 100 feet) deep and extends inside Israel. On the same day, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, issued a statement saying Israel’s supposed "discovery" was designed to distract the public's attention away from criticism targeting Israeli leaders for stalling the process of eliminating the Gaza tunnels and as a way to reassure the Israeli settlers in the Gaza envelope. Then Hamas noted that it has more in store for Israel than a tunnel. On the same day as well, al-Qassam Brigades revealed for the first time its “R 160” missile, which has a range of 160 kilometers (100 miles), meaning it could reach Haifa. Yousef Rizqa, former Hamas minister of information and a political adviser to Ismail Haniyeh, the deputy head of Hamas’ political bureau, told Al-Monitor, “Israel’s announcement of discovering the tunnel aims at reassuring the Israeli population that the government is making great efforts to maintain the security of the settlers, confront Hamas and gain international support for Israel, by illustrating the offensive cross-border tunnels as a threat posed by Hamas. "The more Israel increases its calls to seek out support, the more the expectations for a future war against Gaza increase. Although the resistance in Gaza does not call for a new war and does not want to carry out attacks to break the truce, it has the right to prepare itself on the field, despite the lack of military balance between the resistance and Israel.” In conjunction with all these security developments, both sides carried out field maneuvers. On April 18, the Israeli army launched large-scale military maneuvers in the Golan Heights and the Jordan Valley that included field forces and aircraft. Even before that, on April 10, the Israeli army had its largest military training since the 2014 war in Gaza, with the participation of thousands of soldiers, near the Gaza border to simulate the incursion of Hamas inside Israeli settlements and the detention of Israeli hostages. On April 19, the Ministry of Interior and National Security in Gaza ended the fifth maneuver of its security services, which it had started in Gaza during recent weeks. The maneuver included evacuating all headquarters and increasing security apparatuses, while explosions and weapons firing were heard. Ambulances, civil defense vehicles and the police practiced their movements in a drill that resembled the outbreak of a new war with Israel. Meanwhile, retired Palestinian Maj. Gen. Wassef Erekat told Al-Monitor, “Decision-makers within the resistance leadership in Gaza must be alert of the possibility of Israel launching a [surprise] attack, as it did in the three previous wars in 2008, 2012 and 2014, since the Israeli government is known for being extreme and risk-taking. Perhaps [the Israeli army] is being pressured by the Israeli public to carry out a bloody military operation against Gaza, despite the misleading statements about not wanting this war.” Remarkably enough, Israeli Housing Minister Yoav Galant called April 18 for the Israeli army to prepare for a wide-scale confrontation with Hamas in Gaza by the beginning of summer. Perhaps this call seems dangerous because Galant is a former IDF commander and military general who led the war on Gaza in 2014 and is also a member of Israel’s political-security Cabinet. A Palestinian security official in Gaza told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity, "Hamas’ and Israel’s declaration of their unwillingness to go into a military confrontation anytime soon might face three factors that may eventually lead to an outbreak of this confrontation. The first is the misunderstanding from both parties due to their field efforts on the Gaza-Israel borders; the second is the increased escalation in the West Bank, most recently the operation in Jerusalem on April 18, which wounded 20 Israelis; and the third is the resistance in Gaza feeling that the blockade is tightening with no alleviation initiatives in sight.” Meanwhile on April 23, Hamas warned about the continued tightening of the Israeli blockade on Gaza and called regional and international parties to shoulder their responsibilities in the deteriorating situation. Despite the growing mutual warnings between Hamas and Israel about an imminent confrontation, a number of factors might prevent its outbreak, at least for now. The Israeli army is preoccupied with the growing unrest in the West Bank that began in October. Also, Israelis seem to doubt how much the IDF could actually achieve in Gaza — in terms of completely eliminating the Palestinian factions’ missiles and toppling Hamas — except for killing and wounding thousands of Palestinians. The Israelis must wonder whether it is worth getting pulled back into the Gaza quagmire.

Perhaps [the Israeli army] is being pressured by the Israeli public to carry out a bloody military operation against Gaza, despite the misleading statements about not wanting this war.” Remarkably enough, Israeli Housing Minister Yoav Galant called April 18 for the Israeli army to prepare for a wide-scale confrontation with Hamas in Gaza by the beginning of summer. Perhaps this call seems dangerous because Galant is a former IDF commander and military general who led the war on Gaza in 2014 and is also a member of Israel’s political-security Cabinet. A Palestinian security official in Gaza told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity, "Hamas’ and Israel’s declaration of their unwillingness to go into a military confrontation anytime soon might face three factors that may eventually lead to an outbreak of this confrontation. The first is the misunderstanding from both parties due to their field efforts on the Gaza-Israel borders; the second is the increased escalation in the West Bank, most recently the operation in Jerusalem on April 18, which wounded 20 Israelis; and the third is the resistance in Gaza feeling that the blockade is tightening with no alleviation initiatives in sight.” Meanwhile on April 23, Hamas warned about the continued tightening of the Israeli blockade on Gaza and called regional and international parties to shoulder their responsibilities in the deteriorating situation. Despite the growing mutual warnings between Hamas and Israel about an imminent confrontation, a number of factors might prevent its outbreak, at least for now. The Israeli army is preoccupied with the growing unrest in the West Bank that began in October. Also, Israelis seem to doubt how much the IDF could actually achieve in Gaza — in terms of completely eliminating the Palestinian factions’ missiles and toppling Hamas — except for killing and wounding thousands of Palestinians. The Israelis must wonder whether it is worth getting pulled back into the Gaza quagmire.

News article:
Israel raising the state of alarm along its border with the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, Felesteen newspaper reported. Quoting Israeli sources, the newspaper said that the Israeli leadership raised the state of alarm among its soldiers fearing due to the tense situation along the borders. Meanwhile, Israeli newspaper Maariv reported that the Israeli army told settlers living near the Gaza border to stay at home. This came after the army launched artillery attacks on the Gaza Strip. No casualties were reported. The Israeli air force carried out five F16 airstrikes on several places in Gaza at dawn yesterday, wounding four people, including three children, Palestinian medical sources said. The Israeli army claimed that the artillery shelling came in response to Palestinian mortar attacks against its staff carrying out engineering works along the Gaza border.

News article:
Something's clicked apparently with Hamas's military wing. Its members and leader, Mohammed Deif—the father of the tunnels project—have begun to understand that the IDF has finally developed a way to locate the attack tunnels that they dug underneath the border from Gaza into Israel. Thanks to this method, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades' leaders have understood, the IDF is undertaking intensive and accelerated operations and has already discovered at least two tunnels. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The moment that the Brigades' leaders understood this fact, they found themselves with a severe dilemma: Do they act immediately via their tunnels and other means before they lose their main strategic asset? Or do they refrain from operations and come to terms for now with the fact that Israel will uncover at least some of the tunnels and search for other methods to surprise Israel in the next round? Their dilemma stems from two central facts. One is that the military wing of Hamas still isn't ready for another round of fighting with Israel on the scale of Operation Protective Edge. The second is that the population of Gaza is unable to endure the pain and hardship which will be the result of any major military operation in Gaza that would only worsen the situation further. Not before they restore the destruction of Protective Edge. IDF exposes Hamas tunnel. (Photo: IDF Spokesperson) As a result, Hamas fears a major confrontation with Israel at the present time, especially because it's likely that Hamas would lose its political power due to a popular uprising against it. Hamas has therefore chosen the middle path. The moment that Israel uncovered the latest tunnel, Hamas started shooting "deterrence fire," intended to cause the IDF, out of fear for the safety of its soldiers and workers in the field, slow down its operations. (L-R:) Chief of General Staff, GOC Southern Command, and Southern Brigade Commander near newly discovered tunnel (Photo: IDF Spokesperson) At the same time, this mortar fire is Hamas's way of sending a message to Israel: If you keep looking for our tunnels, we're likely to go crazy, and a war will break out. This is basically what has happened since the latest tunnel was uncovered. The IDF was not deterred by Hamas's mortars, though this is the first time since Protective Edge that the Gazan terror organization independently fired directly at IDF forces. IDF exposes Hamas tunnel. (Photo: IDF Spokesperson) The IDF chief of staff, who views tunnel detection as the military's top priority to maintain Israel's defense and sense of security for the residents of the Gaza border region, hasn't stopped or slowed down any efforts for a moment. To the contrary, with the permission of the prime minister, the defense minister and the cabinet, the operations have been increased, the forces strengthened, and detection efforts heightened. Despite this, it's possible to assess that there are behind-the-scenes talks going on between the Hamas political and military leadership. The leaders of the military wing initiated the fire directed at Israeli forces, even though they know that it may bring about a harsh response from the IDF, which so far has only been tank fire and strikes from the air force. Hamas's political leader, Khaled Meshaal (Photo: AFP) I hasten to add that as a result of pressure from the political wing—which wants to mitigate the threat of another round of violence—the military wing will be careful not to accurately shoot at the IDF, but only fire in its general direction, at least for now. The current argument between the Hamas military wing and the heads of the political wing are primarily based on the fact that the political leadership is putting pressure on the military leadership not to escalate violence. This is despite the fact that they may lose their most important strategic asset, the tunnels. However, the military wing is still at least considering, or so it seems, whether to attack the IDF Engineering Corps to mitigate the discovery of additional tunnels, even if the price for such an attack is an intense escalation. Newly discovered tunnel (Photo: IDF Spokesperson) The political wing is worried about the plight of the civilian population and is trying to convince the military wing to avoid an escalation, even a partial one, because it could evolve into a much larger and unintended confrontation. Evidence of this disagreement can be seen in the public statements released by the political leadership which claim that Egypt will mediate a further de-escalation between Israel and Hamas. These statements are baseless; Egypt will not broker any de-escalation, and IDF forces that left the security perimeter that is located on Palestinian territory left because they finished their jobs. But the political wing is using this fact to offer the military wing a ladder to use to climb down from their figurative tree. It currently seems that the military and political wings of Hamas, together with the State of Israel and the IDF, have no interest in an escalation, and everybody wants to avoid one. But Hamas's military wing is still entangled in the dilemma, and it will have to decide if it will risk losing its attack tunnels and search for a new course of action to strategically surprise Israel in the next round, or if it will take the route of the biblical Samson and destroy itself together with the Philistines. Or, in this case, the tunnel-finding Israelis.

News article:
Hamas says not seeking war but will fight Israeli incursions Hamas's leader in Gaza said Friday his Islamist movement did not seek war with Israel but would resist incursions into the Palestinian enclave, following the worst cross-border violence since 2014. Three days of mortar and tank fire between Israel and Palestinian militants, as well as Israeli air strikes, have raised concerns of a new war in the Hamas-run territory. Ismail Haniya accused Israeli forces of intruding nearly 200 metres (yards) into Gazan territory. Palestinian Hamas militants take part in a 2015 anti-Israeli protest in the southern Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis ©Said Khatib (AFP/File) "We are not calling for a new war, but we will not under any circumstances accept these incursions," he said in a Friday prayer sermon in the Gaza Strip. Earlier, Israeli aircraft carried out their fourth air raid on the enclave since Wednesday, attacking sites at Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza and near Khan Yunis in the south, witnesses said. There were no reports of any casualties. The Israeli army confirmed just one strike, saying aircraft targeted "a Hamas terror infrastructure" in response to cross-border mortar fire. Since Wednesday, Hamas and other militant groups have fired at least 12 mortar rounds across the frontier, and Israeli tanks have fired repeatedly at what the army said were Hamas targets. The Palestinian fire targeted Israeli forces searching along the border, and short distances inside Gaza, for infiltration tunnels leading into southern Israel -- among the most feared weapons of Hamas fighters during the 2014 summer war. On Thursday, Zeina Al-Amour, a 54-year-old Palestinian woman, became the first fatality of the flare-up after Israeli tank fire hit her home, medics said. The violence has raised concerns for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist rulers of Gaza, that has held since the 50-day war in 2014 left 2,251 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead. - Living in fear - On both sides of the border, residents said they were living in fear of a wider conflict. "In the night there is the sound of mortars, bombs, planes," said Jehan Berman, a resident of kibbutz Kerem Shalom which is just 40 metres from the border. "We're tired. We're still recovering from the last war and the next one is already at our door," he told AFP. Kerem Shalom is close to where the army has uncovered two Hamas tunnels, reportedly stretching into Israeli territory, in recent weeks, with the most recent discovery on Thursday. Destruction of such tunnels became one of Israel's primary goals during the 2014 war, with more than 30 eliminated, according to the army. Since the conflict, Hamas has continued to build what it calls "resistance tunnels". Citing Hamas activities, Israel maintains a tight blockade on Gaza in what human rights groups say is collective punishment against its more than 1.8 million residents. Ali al-Moghrabi, 40, a tailor from Gaza City's Al-Hanan Zeitun neighbourhood which was bombed on Thursday, said he still had not recovered from the last conflict. "We do not want war, but the occupier (Israel) never stops," he said. Hamas has accused Israeli soldiers of incursions into Gazan territory in recent days, saying that this constitutes a violation of the 2014 truce. The Israeli army admits it has operated inside Palestinian territory but said it was within 100 metres of the border, where it says it has operated since the 2014 war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his security cabinet on Friday to discuss the latest developments, with his spokesman saying ministers were updated by security officials on the "activities of the past few days and the exposure of the tunnel". Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Friday that Israeli forces withdrew from positions inside the border east of Khan Yunis. A senior Israeli official told AFP he was not aware of any understandings with Hamas regarding ending the exchanges of fire.

A former director of the Shin Bet security service urged Israel on Saturday to take steps to alleviate the economic problems in the Gaza Strip, alongside military measures to counter efforts by the Hamas terror group that rules the coastal enclave to build attack tunnels into Israel. “Israel would do well if, in addition to the operational activities against the tunnels, it worked to alleviate the economic situation and show the residents of Gaza the prospect of an easier and more comfortable future,” said Yaakov Peri, an MK for Yesh Atid and member of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, the Walla news website reported. Israel and Hamas have been exchanging fire across the border since for days, as the terror group tries to thwart IDF troops from seeking out the tunnels it has dug from Gaza into Israeli territory. “Hamas, for its own reasons, is not interested in entering into another confrontation with Israel at this stage,” Peri said, hours after Israeli warplanes struck Hamas targets in southern Gaza following rocket fire on Israeli communities bordering the Strip. “The dire economic situation in the Gaza Strip also makes it difficult for Hamas to initiate another conflict,” the former security chief added.

News article:
http://www.nationalreview.com/node/435107/print Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has at least four different problems. First, an upcoming State Comptroller report seems set to accuse Mr. Netanyahu of keeping critical information from his cabinet in the buildup to Israel’s summer 2014 military action in Gaza, and of failing to adequately respond to tunnels Hamas used in launching attacks on Israeli soil. Second, Mr. Netanyahu is under increasing pressure from coalition partners in his cabinet. As I noted last November, the Israeli government is defined by significant internal tensions. Leading the charge for tougher action against the Palestinians is Education Minister Naftali Bennett. A young, charismatic hawk and proponent of expanded West Bank settlement construction, Mr. Bennett wants to bend Mr. Netanyahu to his hard-line agenda. Third, the likelihood of renewed conflict with Hamas is growing by the day. Recent weeks have seen Hamas escalate the pace of rocket, mortar, knife, and bomb attacks on Israelis. In response, the Israeli military is launching operations against Hamas facilitation nodes. Fourth and finally, tensions are growing with Iranian proxies in the Golan region on Israel’s border. Let’s take the third and fourth issues first. Israel’s strategic goal in dealing with Hamas is to constrain the group’s military capabilities. Partly motivated by the aforementioned domestic controversy over Hamas’s infiltration tunnels in 2014, Netanyahu also wants to ensure that they cannot launch a surprise attack on Israeli civilians. Such an attack would cost innocent lives, and, more important, it would embolden Israeli adversaries at a time of growing regional instability. And that leads us to Iran. With President Bashar al-Assad of Syria now buoyed by Russia, Lebanese Hezbollah (LH) and Iran sense an opportunity to re-commit their energies toward Israel’s northern border. The Syrian Civil War has imposed a heavy military and political toll on Iran and LH, but their existential fetish for Jewish blood is unrelenting. As the Middle East sinks into unrestrained violence, the Obama administration has sat idly by, dancing to Vladimir Putin’s tune at every turn. And without any confidence that Obama would come to its aid in a time of need, Israel is now aligning with the Sunni-Arab monarchies against Iran. Netanyahu’s recent assurance of Israel’s continued claim to the Golan Heights was a physical metaphor for Israel’s evolving security strategy: Israel wants Iran to know that it will not replicate America’s strategy of acquiescence and will role the military dice to preserve its deterrent posture if it must. Domestically, Netanyahu must also now decide how to deal with Naftali Bennett, and big changes may be coming on that front. As columnist Mazal Mualem outlined yesterday, the prime minister may soon form an alliance with Isaac Herzog, the leader of Israel’s liberal Zionist Union coalition. Mr. Herzog’s desire for engagement with the international community would give Israel a stronger diplomatic hand in challenging racist agendas such as the Boycott and Divestment movement. It would also allow Netanyahu to neutralize Bennett, and thus move forward on tentative efforts to build trust with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas in hopes of a possible resumption of peace talks. That’s important, because absent progress toward peace, Mr. Abbas will face an increasing challenge from extreme elements in Fatah’s leadership. And if he’s outmaneuvered, Israel may find itself facing a concerted union of enemies in both Gaza and the West Bank. These are very tough times for Netanyahu. Whatever happens next will have grave consequences for Israel’s security and its relations with the international community. Here’s hoping that the prime minister succeeds, and that the next American president takes our traditional alliances more seriously than Obama. — Tom Rogan writes for National Review Online and Opportunity Lives.

Netanyahu’s recent assurance of Israel’s continued claim to the Golan Heights was a physical metaphor for Israel’s evolving security strategy: Israel wants Iran to know that it will not replicate America’s strategy of acquiescence and will role the military dice to preserve its deterrent posture if it must. Domestically, Netanyahu must also now decide how to deal with Naftali Bennett, and big changes may be coming on that front. As columnist Mazal Mualem outlined yesterday, the prime minister may soon form an alliance with Isaac Herzog, the leader of Israel’s liberal Zionist Union coalition. Mr. Herzog’s desire for engagement with the international community would give Israel a stronger diplomatic hand in challenging racist agendas such as the Boycott and Divestment movement. It would also allow Netanyahu to neutralize Bennett, and thus move forward on tentative efforts to build trust with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas in hopes of a possible resumption of peace talks. That’s important, because absent progress toward peace, Mr. Abbas will face an increasing challenge from extreme elements in Fatah’s leadership. And if he’s outmaneuvered, Israel may find itself facing a concerted union of enemies in both Gaza and the West Bank. These are very tough times for Netanyahu. Whatever happens next will have grave consequences for Israel’s security and its relations with the international community. Here’s hoping that the prime minister succeeds, and that the next American president takes our traditional alliances more seriously than Obama. — Tom Rogan writes for National Review Online and Opportunity Lives.

News article:
Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon on Monday blamed recent Palestinian mortar and rocket attacks and rising tensions on Israel’s border with Gaza on successful IDF steps to locate tunnels that the Hamas terror group has dug into Israeli territory. He also cautioned that Israel would not ignore ongoing attacks. “In the last few days, we’ve seen various attempts from Gaza to disturb our lives and threaten us,” he said at a memorial ceremony in Tel Aviv to honor Defense Ministry personnel killed in the line of duty. The attacks are “a result of Israel having developed the ability to detect tunnels, an advanced technology that the Defense Ministry and its workers have been involved in developing and using in recent days,” he added, according to a Defense Ministry transcript. Ya’alon warned that if the shooting does not stop, Israel would respond forcefully against Hamas. “Against this terror stands the IDF and various security agencies who are responding decisively to the shooting from the Strip — shooting that, if it continues, will lead to a more severe response for Hamas and other terror organizations in the Strip, until they understand it’s not wise to test us.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Hamas has intermittently exchanged fire with Israeli troops as they worked to destroy tunnels inside Gaza in the past week, but the group has also conveyed to Israel through Egypt that it does not seek an escalation, Israeli officials said. At least 20 mortar shells were fired at Israeli territory from Gaza, while Israeli Air Force fighter jets struck Hamas targets multiple times last week and over the weekend. One rocket fired from Gaza landed in an open area in the Eshkol regional council late Friday. A second fell close to the border fence. Neither caused any injuries or damage, but sent residents dashing to their air-raid shelters as missile defense sirens sounded. Advertisement Hamas security sources said an IAF raid hit two brickworks in the southern city of Khan Younis, causing damage but no casualties. But witnesses said two missiles hit a base belonging to Hamas’s military wing east of the city, causing significant damage. On Saturday, Israeli officials told Channel 10 News that operations to uncover and destroy cross-border attack tunnels in Gaza would continue despite the violence. They added that Hamas’s tunnel infrastructure was far from the robust network the group possessed before the 2014 Gaza war, and included only a small number of tunnels. Two rockets fired from the Palestinian enclave early Saturday morning were not thought to have been launched by Hamas, but by a smaller terror group seeking to destabilize the region. Hamas, Israel said, was not seeking to widen the conflict to attacks on civilians, and limiting its fire to troops operating inside Gaza. Israeli farmers who were barred last week from their fields that lie within a kilometer from the Strip, for fear of Gazan sniper fire, were allowed to return Sunday to work in the fields. Palestinian media reports on Friday afternoon said Israel and Hamas reached a truce agreement, brokered by Egypt, which would go into effect immediately. But the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, stressed that no such agreement had been reached. “The army intends to maintain its activities against Hamas as [the group] continues to breach Israeli sovereignty and build tunnels,” he said. Despite the increased tension along the border with Gaza in recent weeks, the years since the 2014 conflict, known as Operation Protective Edge, have been the quietest in over a decade in terms of rocket fire and attacks coming from the coastal enclave.

News article:
Islamic State fighters have recently arrived in the Gaza Strip to train with their Hamas counterparts, a senior IDF official said in an Arabic interview published Friday. The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai told the Saudi news website Elaph that IS members entered the Gaza Strip from the Sinai Peninsula through smuggling tunnels maintained and controlled by Hamas. The fighters entered the Hamas-controlled territory in coordination with Sa’id Abed al-A’al, a resident of the Gaza Strip city of Rafah connected to Hamas, he said. Mordechai, the head of the Defense Ministry body responsible for the Israeli border crossings with the Gaza Strip and Civil Administration in the West Bank, said the military cooperation between the Islamic State and Hamas is unfolding with the full knowledge and consent of Hamas’s leaders. According to the report, Hamas members have also treated wounded IS terrorists who entered the Strip from the Sinai Peninsula. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms An Islamic State-affiliate has waged a guerrilla war against the Egyptian military in the Sinai for several years, carrying out dozens of attacks targeting soldiers and police in the northern part of the restive peninsula. In an effort to help combat the Islamic State in Egypt, the US Embassy in Cairo said Friday that Egypt has received its first shipment of armored vehicles designed to protect soldiers from roadside bombs. The embassy said in a statement that the first batch of 762 MRAP (Mine Resistance Ambush Protected) vehicles was delivered Thursday, and is aimed at helping to “combat terrorism and promote stability in the region.” Advertisement While Hamas “tries to draw closer to Egypt, it’s connecting with the Islamic State and with the Muslim Brotherhood,” Mordechai said, referring to the outlawed Islamic party whose president Mohammed Morsi briefly ruled Egypt before being deposed in 2013. Hamas has apparently tried to distance itself from the Islamic State and Iran with the hope that Cairo would loosen its blockade on the Gaza Strip. But according to Haaretz, reports pointing to ties between Hamas leaders and terrorist groups operating against Egypt in the Sinai are causing the group embarrassment. Palestinian sources quoted by the paper say that while Hamas leaders have adopted a policy of increasing ties with Egypt, there are still senior officials who are unwilling to break free of Iran and Salafi groups that can also serve as a source of income. Hamas is also under pressure from the Saudi royal family to cut all ties with Iran, Saudi Arabia’s enemy. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Coordinator of Government Activity in the Territories Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, told a Saudi news website that ISIS activists have entered Gaza from Sinai and are trading weapons and money to Hamas in return for medical care. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Mordechai was speaking with the Saudi online newspaper Elaph. He stated that the members of ISIS entered the Gaza Strip a few days ago from Egypt via the tunnels. The purpose of their visit was to carry out military exercises in the strip, the major general relayed, which they coordinated with a source close to Hamas, Said Abed Al-Aal. Yoav Mordechai (Photo: Chaim Tsach, GPO) In the interview, the coordinator explained that Hamas is aiding ISIS by providing medical treatment for its people in Gazan hospitals in exchange for money and weaponry. According to Mordechai, there is mutual coordination between the military echelons of Hamas and ISIS, which is known to Hamas's senior political leaders, as well. Elaph also reported that wounded have been recently transferred from the Sinai Peninsula, where ISIS is active, to Gaza. This report is expected to embarrass Hamas before Egypt, with whom the terrorist organization is attempting to rehabilitate its relationship. One of Hamas's goals with Egypt is to persuade the government to open the Rafah Crossing with Gaza.

News article:
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) said Friday that the threats of the newly appointment Israeli Defense Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, against the movement and the Gaza Strip, do not scare it, and that it will always remain steady. Member of the Political Bureau of Hamas Fathi Hammad said during a massive procession marking the Palestinian Nakba of 1948, west of Gaza city, said that Hamas will not be intimidated into submission, and will respond to “any attack with a similar one, and any war with war.” “We are not calling for war or escalation,” Hammad said, “But if it was forced on us, we will be ready to fight till the end.” His statements came after Lieberman threatened to assassinate all the political leaders of the Hamas movement, should they “fail to return the bodies of soldiers,” who were killed during the 2014 Israeli aggression on the coastal region, that led to the death of more than 2400 Palestinians, among them about 1600 civilians, including hundreds of children, infants, women and elders, and dozens of thousands of injuries, in 52 days, in addition to the complete or partial destruction of dozens of thousands of homes, public and private facilities, including hospitals and medical center. Referring to the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Hammad said that “Abbas has no place in the leadership, and must step aside.” At the end of the procession, many Hamas members tore and burnt pictures of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the newly appointed Defense Minister Lieberman, in addition to the sacked minister Moshe Ya’alon.

News article:
Palestinian Hamas resistance movement has declared that its leaders are not at all fearful of the assassination threats made against them by far-right Israeli politician Avigdor Lieberman, who has now been appointed as the regime’s minister of military affairs. Hamas politburo member Fathi Hammad said during a Friday protest rally in the Gaza Strip that the threats previously made by Lieberman to assassinate the movement’s political and military leaders would not affect the popular resistance group. The rally was being held to mark the 1948 creation of the Israeli regime — known as the Nakba Day or the Day of the Catastrophe. During the rally, thousands of Palestinian residents of the territory burned pictures of high-ranking Israeli officials and demanded an end to the nine-year-old siege of impoverished Gaza. Palestinians burn pictures of Avigdor Lieberman during Nakba Day rallies in the besieged Gaza Strip, May 20, 2016. (Photo by AFP) “We do not call for war, but we would fight if it was imposed upon us,” Hammad said. ‘On the brink of madness’ Lieberman, who leads Israel's far-right Yisrael Beiteinu party, earlier accepted an offer by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to become minister of military affairs. The hawkish politician is notorious for his threats to have Hamas leaders assassinated, notably saying in 2014 that murdering Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal would be the only way to deter future tunnel construction in the densely-populated Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade since 2007. He has also called on Israel to treat Hamas the same way as the United States treated “the Japanese in World War II.” Palestinian women walk past a mural on the 68th anniversary of the Nakba Day, in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip, May 15, 2016. (Photo by AFP) With Lieberman becoming minister of military affairs, Netanyahu is now set to lead the most extremist cabinet in the history of the Israeli regime. Opposition politician Isaac Herzog has said that, with the inclusion of Lieberman, the Israeli cabinet is now “on the brink of madness.” The Palestinian Foreign Ministry has also censured Liberman’s appointment, saying in a Thursday statement that the decision “confirms the lack of a peace partner in Israel.” “Whoever follows daily the procedures and violations carried out by the extremist Netanyahu administration against the Palestinian people, [sees] the racist, radical and violent nature of the politics of the cabinet since day one,” the statement added. In his Friday remarks, Hammad also said Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas of the rival Fatah movement “does not have a place in the leadership of our people and he should step aside.”

News article:
A Republican senator is trying to block the Obama administration from buying nuclear materials from Iran. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) this week filed an amendment to an energy and water appropriations bill that would bar the government from using federal funds to buy Iran’s heavy water, which can be used in nuclear reactors. “It seems the president will go to any lengths to protect his nuclear deal,” Cotton said in a statement. “We’ve given the terror-sponsoring Iranian regime enough concessions at the risk of our security; we should not further subsidize its enrichment activity by making repeated purchases of this material.” {mosads}The measure is not scheduled to come up for a vote, and it is unclear whether it will hit the Senate floor before lawmakers take up the underlying appropriations bill on Wednesday. Yet the move by Cotton underscores the lingering anger over the Obama administration’s dealings with Iran following President Obama’s nuclear pact with the country. On Friday, the Energy Department announced it would spend roughly $8.6 million to buy 32 tons of heavy water from Iran, which signaled that other countries should feel free to follow suit. The department has said that the heavy water — which can be used as a coolant for some nuclear activities but also has other applications — will be resold to research and other organizations in the United States. The announced purchase came as Iran was staring down a July deadline to reduce its stockpile of the material under the international nuclear accord, and analysts worried it would not meet its obligation. The nuclear pact, which was implemented earlier this year, lifts sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on its ability to build a nuclear weapon. “Part of the prescribed steps that they had to take was to reduce their nuclear stockpile, and that involved reducing their technological nuclear capabilities,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said on Tuesday. “Iran did have to ship a bunch of its heavy water out of the country and that’s what they have done, and now they’re selling off the stockpile and the United States has purchased some of it.” Earnest appeared to take an extra shot at Cotton, who previously earned the administration’s ire by authoring a letter to Iran trying to undermine the agreement last year. “I would suggest that if he has genuine concerns about this, maybe he can just write another letter to the supreme leader and see how far that gets him,” the spokesman quipped. The administration has claimed the purchase will not be a permanent arrangement. “I know of no intention to keep doing this on a recurring basis,” State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday. –This report was updated at 1:49 p.m.

News article:
Sen. Tom Cotton and the White House are engaged in a testy back-and-forth over the issue of buying heavy water from Iran. "The White House may think it's a laughing matter to subsidize Iran's nuclear program, but I don't," the Arkansas Republican said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" Thursday morning. "Heavy water is not radioactive, not dangerous in normal quantities, but it is an essential part of any nuclear program like Iran's." On Wednesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest took aim at Cotton after Senate Democrats said they would continue debating a spending bill because of a Cotton amendment that would have blocked the purchase of heavy water from Iran. "Sen. Cotton is certainly no expert when it comes to heavy water. I'm confident that he couldn't differentiate heavy water from sparkling water. His focus is on undermining the effective implementation of this agreement that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon," Earnest said. Those comments came after the Energy Department said it would buy 32 tons of heavy water from Iran that could be used for nuclear material. Cotton said Thursday that the U.S. is not obligated to buy that heavy water. "We certainly are not obligated to provide taxpayer dollars for Iran's program for that heavy water," Cotton explained. "I offered a simple amendment on the Department of Energy's budget that said the U.S. taxpayer next year would not subsidize any more kinds of bills like this. Unfortunately, the Democrats blocked that amendment and that bill from going forward, even though I have a large majority in favor of my proposal." Co-host Joe Scarborough asked Cotton why he thought Democrats blocked it, to which he replied they don't want to be seen as "opposing their president" or going on the record as having U.S. taxpayer dollars "subsidizing Iran's nuclear majority program." "[O]n Capitol Hill, a poison pill is a term people use when they say this is a popular policy I oppose and I don't have the votes to stop," Cotton said in rejecting the notion that his amendment was a "poison pill" meant to kill the overall bill. "And I didn't do this at the last minute. The administration at the last minute on Friday night dropped the news they were giving $9 million to Iran's nuclear program. I filed this amendment on Monday, the very first day we were back in session after the administration's last-minute news dump on Friday night." Cotton also added that he will put the amendment into a stand-alone bill, for which he has a majority in favor.

Sen. Tom Cotton and the White House are engaged in a testy back-and-forth over the issue of buying heavy water from Iran. "The White House may think it's a laughing matter to subsidize Iran's nuclear program, but I don't," the Arkansas Republican said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" Thursday morning. "Heavy water is not radioactive, not dangerous in normal quantities, but it is an essential part of any nuclear program like Iran's." On Wednesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest took aim at Cotton after Senate Democrats said they would continue debating a spending bill because of a Cotton amendment that would have blocked the purchase of heavy water from Iran. "Sen. Cotton is certainly no expert when it comes to heavy water. I'm confident that he couldn't differentiate heavy water from sparkling water. His focus is on undermining the effective implementation of this agreement that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon," Earnest said. Those comments came after the Energy Department said it would buy 32 tons of heavy water from Iran that could be used for nuclear material. Cotton said Thursday that the U.S. is not obligated to buy that heavy water. "We certainly are not obligated to provide taxpayer dollars for Iran's program for that heavy water," Cotton explained. "I offered a simple amendment on the Department of Energy's budget that said the U.S. taxpayer next year would not subsidize any more kinds of bills like this. Unfortunately, the Democrats blocked that amendment and that bill from going forward, even though I have a large majority in favor of my proposal." Co-host Joe Scarborough asked Cotton why he thought Democrats blocked it, to which he replied they don't want to be seen as "opposing their president" or going on the record as having U.S. taxpayer dollars "subsidizing Iran's nuclear majority program." "[O]n Capitol Hill, a poison pill is a term people use when they say this is a popular policy I oppose and I don't have the votes to stop," Cotton said in rejecting the notion that his amendment was a "poison pill" meant to kill the overall bill. "And I didn't do this at the last minute. The administration at the last minute on Friday night dropped the news they were giving $9 million to Iran's nuclear program. I filed this amendment on Monday, the very first day we were back in session after the administration's last-minute news dump on Friday night." Cotton also added that he will put the amendment into a stand-alone bill, for which he has a majority in favor.

News article:
In line with this criticism, the Arkansas Republican added a last-minute amendment to a Department of Energy spending bill that Congress was set to vote on this week, in which he specified that taxpayer money could not be utilized for similar such purchases in the next budget year. As a result, Senate Democrats blocked the bill on Wednesday, in spite of the fact that its other provisions had reportedly had strong bi-partisan support. Those Democrats described Cotton’s amendment as a “poison pill,” but CNN points out that his Republican supporters countered that the Democrats had refused a simple majority vote on the amendment, possibly out of concern that fellow Democrats would side with Cotton on the issue. Indeed, a number of Democrats have joined the Republican Party in opposing or generally criticizing the Iran nuclear deal and the Obama administration’s overall Iran policy. Despite this fact, the Democratic minority succeeded in preventing a vote of disapproval on that deal last year, by utilizing congressional filibuster rules. Similarly, this week’s budget bill was blocked by minority opposition, as it needed 60 “yay” votes to advance but received only 50, as compared to 46 votes of “nay.” Cotton has been a particularly strong voice of opposition to the White House’s Iran policy, having previously drawn stark criticism for convincing 46 of his fellow congressmen to sign a letter to the Iranian government announcing that the US government in the near future might elect to simply not enforce the agreement reached between the Obama administration and its Iranian counterpart. The newer controversy over the purchase of heavy water comes close on the heels of largely Republican accusations that the Obama administration was considering a change in Treasury Department rules which would effectively give the Iranians access to the US dollar and the American financial system. The administration had previously promised Congress that this would not happen as a result of implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The perceived betrayal of that promise was viewed as potentially giving away virtually the last bit of leverage that the US government had over Iran and its nuclear ambitions. The Iranian regime had publicly taken issued with the retention of that leverage in recent weeks, with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei accusing the US of implementing the JCPOA only “on paper,” while still scaring away international banks and some European businesses from reentering the Iranian market. Officials from the administration of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani have echoed these criticisms, apparently prompting two meetings last week between Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and US Secretary of State John Kerry. It is recognizably true that the ongoing separation of the Iranian and American financial systems is a contributing factor in keeping some investors and potential partners out of Iran. But many analysts have also observed that such decisions are also based on the legitimate fear that Iranian behavior will justify or even necessity the re-imposition of US-led economic sanctions at some point in the future. This assessment of the situation was repeated on Thursday by Economy Watch, which reported that the Washington-based World Bank was still noticeably reluctant to reengage with Tehran following the implementation of the nuclear deal. The organization’s president, Jim Young Kim says that the World Bank has no specific plans at the current time, but Economy Watch says that the World Bank is not exploiting the lack of official restrictions yet because it wishes to remain on good terms with its host country, the US. The article adds that the lending institution is no doubt aware of the possibility that relations between the two countries could rapidly deteriorate from the current climate of rapprochement. To be sure, the push-back from Cotton and other critics of the deal is a contributing factor in this, but so too is the anti-Western sentiment that is regularly being expressed by the Iranian regime, which arguably justifies a Republican response. The World Bank and other international businesses may feel even more reticent in the midst of reminders of the possible consequences of falling afoul or lingering or re-imposed economic sanctions. As outstanding issues continue to be resolved and other instances of tension continue to develop between Iran and the West, these are not difficult to come by. The most recent such reminder comes in the form of the arraignment of Reza Zarrab, who was the key-figure in a scandal that emerged three years ago involving Turkish evasion of sanctions on Iran. Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty reminded readers of the details of that scandal on Thursday, noting that the case involves hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of transactions. The fresh memory of such illicit activities no doubt serves to underscore Western critics concerns about Iran’s behavior and the possible danger of providing money to a financial system that remains the State Department continues to regard as being of “primary money laundering concern.”

News article:
President Obama's top foreign policy aide believes Congress is incapable of "reasoned public debate," an assumption that governed how Obama's team sought to win support for the nuclear deal with Iran. "I mean, I'd prefer a sober, reasoned public debate, after which members of Congress reflect and take a vote," Ben Rhodes, the president's deputy national security adviser, told the New York Times. "But that's impossible." That assessment was part of a profile of Rhodes that explained how he crafted an "actively misleading" story about the deal to the American public. Rhodes discussed how he takes advantage of ignorant reporters who have spent most of their careers covering campaigns — "they literally know nothing," he says — in order to ensure that a positive message about the deal was broadcast to the public. While Congress mulled voting down the Iran deal, Rhodes insisted that the agreement would weaken the radicals in Iranian government and empower more moderate voices. "What we saw throughout this negotiation, and what was evident through public statements, was that the hardliners in Iran actually opposed this deal," he said last July. "They've been very comfortable in the status quo, where essentially large chunks of Iranian society were suffering under sanctions." To the New York Times, Rhodes admitted that the nuclear talks were underway long before any election brought "moderate" Iranians to power. "In the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this," he told the Times. "We had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else. So we knew the tactics that worked."

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., dismissed one of President Obama's top staffers as a "fiction writer" who has endangered the United States by playing a key role in developing and selling the Iran nuclear deal. "Ben Rhodes started out as a fiction writer and it's clear he never stopped," Cotton told the Washington Examiner. Cotton's statement comes in response to a profile of Rhodes, who was studying for a master's in creative writing before pursuing a career in government service. The profile was notable for Rhodes' comments about how the White House team manipulates reporters, his belief that "rational discourse" is impossible, and his decision to be "actively misleading" in the public portrayal of how the Iran nuclear deal was negotiated. "I mean, I'd prefer a sober, reasoned public debate, after which members of Congress reflect and take a vote," Rhodes told the New York Times. "But that's impossible." Obama's team angered lawmakers, especially on the Republican side, by refusing to submit the Iran deal as a treaty that would require support from two-thirds of the Senate. When Cotton wrote an open letter explaining to Iranian leaders that this refusal meant that the next president could revoke the deal, the White House hit back. "I think it's somewhat ironic that some members of Congress want to make common cause with the hardliners in Iran," Obama replied. But Rhodes acknowledged to the Times that those "hardliners" were the ones agreeing to the deal — that the rise of putative moderates in the 2013 Iranian elections had nothing to do with the decision to start negotiations, which began before the elections. "Yes, I would prefer that it turns out that [senior Iranian officials] are real reformers who are going to be steering this country into the direction that I believe it can go in, because their public is educated and, in some respects, pro-American," Rhodes said. "But we are not betting on that." Rhodes maintained that it was correct to manipulate the public debate about the Iran talks because "rational discourse" is not possible. "In the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this," he said. Cotton suggested that such an attitude is inappropriate for a senior White House official. "It's cute when kids play make-believe," he said. "It's dangerous when the president and his advisers do."

News article:
May 11, 2016 Congress hasn't managed to pass a single Iran-related bill since the nuclear deal went into effect last year, but that doesn't mean its supporters can breathe easy. Behind the scenes, lawmakers in both chambers and both parties have been working together on comprehensive legislation that will seek to punish Iran for its human-rights abuses, ballistic missile tests and other activities. That strategy could help explain why a bill to renew sanctions on Iran's energy sector that expires at the end of the year has been bottled up in the Senate banking panel for the past 11 months despite bipartisan support for its passage. "My sense on the Republican side is that the leadership is not going to accept a mere extension [of the Iran Sanctions Act] without additional sanctions," said Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J. "Certainly I want to get it done, period. But if it helps drive a bigger package, that's a good thing." Menendez, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who opposed the Iran deal, has been working for months with panel chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., on broader sanctions legislation. That effort is on the verge of succeeding, Corker told Al-Monitor May 11. "We have a bipartisan bill," Corker said, "and we're getting ready to roll it out real soon." Menendez said a recent New York Times magazine profile of Obama's foreign policy advisor, Ben Rhodes, has only energized deal-skeptic lawmakers because of the dim view it takes of Congress. In the much-discussed article, Rhodes says that a "sober, reasoned public debate after which members of Congress reflect and take a vote" is "impossible." "Certainly those of us who were already [wary] before the Rhodes interview became public and are very close to producing an Iran non-nuclear sanctions package obviously feel not only justified but vindicated," Menendez said. House members likewise have increasingly been signaling their intentions to go after Iran with everything they can muster. "Before this president leaves office, we must do everything possible to prevent his administration from making further concessions to Iran," House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., wrote in a May 9 op-ed in the right-leaning online news site Independent Journal Review. "This includes blocking any attempt to make it easier for the mullahs in Tehran to conduct their trade in dollars. We are also committed to renewing the Iran Sanctions Act by the end of this year." "In the coming weeks," Ryan promised, "House Republicans will present the country with an overarching vision for our national security." House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-Calif., and ranking member Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., have been working on such legislation for several months. The two leaders at one point hoped to have a bill ready in time for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) annual conference in late March, but Engel said the timing wasn't right. "We at first thought that maybe we could speed up whatever we could because the AIPAC activists could be great people to lobby for us," Engel told Al-Monitor. "But we realized it was rushing it and it wasn't really ready and we really didn't have consensus and we kind of ran out of time. But I want to make sure Iran's feet are held to the fire for everything that was promised under the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action], and if there are violations from Iran, we want to deal with them." Engel, however, said he could support a stand-alone renewal of the Iran Sanctions Act, which lawmakers view as a vital backstop in case Iran cheats on its nuclear commitments under the JCPOA. Obama administration officials have urged Congress to hold off on the renewal for now, arguing that multilateral sanctions at the United Nations could be reinstated without the possibility of a veto if Iran is deemed to have cheated. But it's not clear if the president would veto such a bill. "I think each issue stands on its own," Engel said. "I would be in favor of passing an ISA bill stand-alone. But I would also be in favor of doing that bill and another bill." The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said he supports renewing the Iran Sanctions Act and strengthening ballistic missile sanctions, but that the Republican leadership appears to want more. "I think we could do both and get broad consensus," Cardin said, "but I do not sense a lot of enthusiasm by the Republican floor leadership to move in that direction." As a result, he said, there has been "no progress" in his talks with Corker, suggesting that the chairman may end up releasing his bill with Menendez on board but not Cardin. The negotiations haven't prevented individual members from trying to take aim at Iran on their own, but those efforts have so far gone nowhere. On May 11, the Senate voted 57-42 — not enough to pass the 60-vote threshold — on an amendment to an energy spending bill by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., that would have prohibited the United States from buying heavy water from Iran to prevent it from inadvertently violating the deal.

But I want to make sure Iran's feet are held to the fire for everything that was promised under the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action], and if there are violations from Iran, we want to deal with them." Engel, however, said he could support a stand-alone renewal of the Iran Sanctions Act, which lawmakers view as a vital backstop in case Iran cheats on its nuclear commitments under the JCPOA. Obama administration officials have urged Congress to hold off on the renewal for now, arguing that multilateral sanctions at the United Nations could be reinstated without the possibility of a veto if Iran is deemed to have cheated. But it's not clear if the president would veto such a bill. "I think each issue stands on its own," Engel said. "I would be in favor of passing an ISA bill stand-alone. But I would also be in favor of doing that bill and another bill." The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said he supports renewing the Iran Sanctions Act and strengthening ballistic missile sanctions, but that the Republican leadership appears to want more. "I think we could do both and get broad consensus," Cardin said, "but I do not sense a lot of enthusiasm by the Republican floor leadership to move in that direction." As a result, he said, there has been "no progress" in his talks with Corker, suggesting that the chairman may end up releasing his bill with Menendez on board but not Cardin. The negotiations haven't prevented individual members from trying to take aim at Iran on their own, but those efforts have so far gone nowhere. On May 11, the Senate voted 57-42 — not enough to pass the 60-vote threshold — on an amendment to an energy spending bill by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., that would have prohibited the United States from buying heavy water from Iran to prevent it from inadvertently violating the deal.

News article:
Congressman Jason Chaffetz, (R-Utah), chair of the House Oversight Committee, is calling for Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes to testify at a hearing about the controversial Iran nuclear deal. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Rhodes admitted to misleading the press and the public with the diplomatic particulars leading up to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran deal. Rep. Chaffetz said on FOX Business Network’s Varney & Co. that he has invited Rhodes, along with Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), to have a “rational discussion” with Congress. “We are going to have a hearing regardless, but he [Rhodes] should show up. He hasn’t indicated that he is not going to show up and we should have this dialogue,” Chaffetz said. Chaffetz, who opposes the Iran deal, says the misinformation used to sell it to the American public and the findings from the Times interview confirm Rhodes has misled the public. “The president has entrusted him [Rhodes] in a very powerful position and this article I think clearly lays out that he used that podium and used that position and the bowels of the White House there to mislead the American people.” The Iran deal is an international agreement that was reached in Vienna on July 14, 2015 between Iran and five members of the United Nations Security Council on the Middle Eastern country’s nuclear program. Rhodes was asked to appear at a hearing on Tuesday, May 17 at 10 a.m. Related Articles

News article:
US Republican senators have demanded that President Barack Obama “dismiss” his top advisor, Ben Rhodes, over attempts to “mislead elected lawmakers and the American public” over a nuclear deal between Iran and the world powers. The deputy national security advisor for strategic communication was accused of creating an “echo chamber” to sell the agreement to the anti-Iran GOPers, according to the letter, citing a New York Times Magazine profile. ‘Sober debate’ In the piece titled “The Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama’s Foreign-Policy Guru,” Rhodes “admitted” to reporter David Samuels that the Obama administration “created an echo chamber.” Rhodes argued that he would have opted for “a sober, reasoned public debate (over the nuclear agreement), after which members of Congress reflect and take a vote… But that’s impossible.” The piece, published on May 5, made GOP lawmakers ask Obama to dismiss the top aide. Rhodes was also asked to attend a congressional hearing Tuesday, which he skipped as “the appearance of a senior presidential adviser before Congress threatens the independence and autonomy of the President,” according to a response by White House Counsel W. Neil Eggleston to Chairman Jason Chaffetz’ request. ‘Deeply disturbed’ After arduous talks that spanned 20 months, negotiators reached a landmark deal over Iran's nuclear program in Vienna on July 14, 2015. The GOPers have spared no efforts to disrupt nuclear negotiations with Tehran as well as the JCPOA, reached between Tehran and the P5+1 -- the US, Britain, Russia, China, France, and Germany -- last year. Rhodes’ idea that the Republican-controlled Congress is incapable of a reasonable conversation over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action infuriated the senators. “We call on you to dismiss Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes before he further tarnishes the Office of President,” read the letter by the “deeply disturbed” lawmakers. ‘Wildly misinformed’ Senator Tom Cotton (R-Ark) White House press secretary Josh Earnest, however, defended Rhodes, saying it was the time for the Republicans to “have some explaining.” "I think there are some people who have some explaining to do when it comes to the wildly false accusations that they made about the Iran deal. And it's not the administration. It's Republicans who are demonstrably wrong when it comes to the Iran deal," Earnest said, accusing several Republican lawmakers, including Arkansas republican Senator Tom Cotton, of being "wildly misinformed, mistaken or lying." Chaffetz responded to Earnest in a tweet, saying, "Dear @PressSec, @SenTomCotton will testify if @rhodes44 is man enough to show. Let's discuss the truth.” With their long-term links to the Israeli regime, the anti-Tehran Republican lawmakers fear a stronger Iran in the Middle East after the JCPOA.

News article:
House Republicans laid into the White House on Tuesday after a senior national security adviser declined to testify on the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran. The White House’s decision not to make Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, available to explain his controversial comments was hypocritical and evidence of a broader evasiveness about the nuclear accord, Republicans on the House Oversight Committee alleged. {mosads}In doing so, House Republicans made clear that their fury over the Iran deal has barely diminished since they failed to scuttle it last year. Instead, the GOP’s attitude appears to have evolved from criticism over details of the deal itself — which critics say will only ensure Iran’s ability to acquire a nuclear weapon after a decade — to claims that the process fits into a broader pattern of deception on the part of the Obama administration. “There are a lot of outstanding questions,” Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said during Tuesday morning’s hearing, which proceeded despite Rhodes’s absence. “You have plenty of time, Mr. Rhodes, to go around and talk to all the media friends and talk to the echo chamber. But when it comes time to actually answer questions under oath, you decide not to do it.” Republican criticism has increasingly come to resemble comments about the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, which critics say was marketed around falsehoods that fell apart after the healthcare reform law was passed. “This isn’t the fist time this administration on some big policy decision has deceived the American people,” said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). Jordan compared Rhodes’s comments to those of Jonathan Gruber, a former administration adviser whose remarks about the healthcare law were vigorously scrutinized by Congress more than a year ago. “Mr. Gruber deceives the American people on ObamaCare,” Jordan said. “Along comes Mr. Rhodes on the Iranian deal, uses deception to create this false choice [between the deal and war with Iran], helps get this agreement passed.” In a New York Times Magazine profile , Rhodes boasted about having created an “echo chamber” of support for the Iran deal before it came to a vote in Congress last summer. The article asserted that the White House misled the American public and Capitol Hill by suggesting the nuclear accord was designed to take advantage of a moderating moment within Iran and to avoid a future war with the nation, when actually, the story indicates, the deal was part of a grander plan to realign the United States’s stance in the Middle East. While he declined to appear before the House panel on Tuesday, Rhodes defended himself during an afternoon appearance at the Center for New American Security, a think tank. “When things like this happen, that’s a part of what happens in Washington,” Rhodes said in response to a question about the magazine story. “The people who know me know what I care about and know how I approach issues and know what motivates me in this job.” On Capitol Hill, Chaffetz scolded Rhodes for appearing at the think tank event but avoiding his committee. Publication of the story earlier this month sparked a renewed debate about the merits of the Iran agreement, which went into full effect in January. For Democrats, Tuesday’s hearing was just the latest in a stubborn effort to keep fighting the deal. “The Republicans rushed to hold this hearing not as a way to obtain substantive information about the merits of the Iran agreement, neither to investigate legitimate allegations,” said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the panel’s top Democrat. “Instead, this hearing is exactly what it purports to condemn: a partisan narrative designed to mislead the American people. That is not just ironic — that is hypocritical.” The White House mocked the committee’s efforts to drag Rhodes before the committee in the days before Tuesday’s hearing. “The truth is, it is Republicans in Congress who criticized the Iran deal, who have got a lot to explain when it comes to saying things about the Iran deal that didn’t turn out to be true,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday. “And if they want to hold a hearing to determine whether or not Republicans were just wrong and badly misinformed, or if they were purposefully lying to the American people, then they can do that.” Earnest has previously said Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) and other critics of the agreement should be forced to testify about their comments that were “wildly wrong or lying.” Republicans attempted to call the administration’s bluff. “Here I am,” Gosar, a member of the Oversight Committee, said Tuesday. “Where is Ben Rhodes? I guess you can run and hide.” Cotton, who has previously sparred with Earnest over the Iran deal, had planned to testify following the White House spokesman’s comments. But that offer was contingent on Rhodes’s appearance, lawmakers said. Instead of hearing from Rhodes and Cotton, lawmakers on Tuesday questioned three foreign policy experts from right-leaning think tanks. Among them was John Hannah, a former official with the George W. Bush administration ahead of the invasion of Iraq. “I find it incredibly hypocritical to invite Mr. Hannah — who worked for Dick Cheney and helped market the Iraq War based on false pretenses — to come now before us as an expert witness on alleged White House false narratives,” said Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), who opposed the Iran deal but nonetheless criticized the GOP’s continued attacks. “I find the hypocrisy really beyond belief.” The White House had originally appeared to rule out asserting executive privilege to keep Rhodes from testifying before the committee last week but then seemed to backtrack in a letter on Monday, saying he would not appear. Chaffetz has threatened to subpoena Rhodes to bring him before the committee, but the White House could ignore that demand as well. “We wanted to get the person who is right in the thick of things from the White House to come here and testify,” Chaffetz said. “The White House on Thursday claimed that this wasn’t about executive privilege, and then less than 24 hours before this hearing, they reversed course and said this was about executive privilege,” he added. “Now who’s being inconsistent?” Updated at 4:09 p.m. Jordan Fabian contributed.

News article:
Democrats and Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee sparred Tuesday over whether the White House, led by national security adviser Ben Rhodes, misled the public about the nuclear agreement with Iran in order to sell the deal to Congress and the public. A panel of Iran experts invited to testify in Rhodes' stead by committee Republicans argued the administration created a false narrative in which America's only options were war or the nuclear deal, a dichotomy they said was misleading. Michael Rubin, a resident scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, said White House officials also inaccurately characterized Iranian President Hassan Rouhani as a moderate politician upon his election in 2013. Michael Doran, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said Obama aides created a "pleasing story" with little basis in reality about moderates ascending to power alongside Rouhani in Iran. Doran said the administration attempted to draw "moral equivalence" between critics of the nuclear deal and hardliners in Iran who opposed Rouhani. Rhodes' refusal to testify before the committee Tuesday ruffled Republican feathers. Rhodes came under fire after a May 5 story in the New York Times exposed some of the aide's aggressive messaging tactics. Those included providing fictitious talking points to think tanks who then fed the talking points as facts to reporters, creating what he called an "echo chamber" in favor of the Iran Deal. Rep. Trey Gowdy blasted Rhodes for citing executive privilege in order to avoid testifying while speaking freely to reporters. The South Carolina Republican also hit Rhodes for his educational background in creative writing, which was explored in the Times piece that dragged the White House aide into the spotlight. "If you're interested in writing haikus and sonnets, he's probably the right guy," Gowdy said of Rhodes. The hearing came as Republican senators pressed President Obama to remove Rhodes for his "astonishing level of disrespect towards the U.S. Congress." Democrats on the Oversight Committee, however, argued the administration did not misrepresent the nuclear agreement with Iran when pitching it to Congress and lauded the deal as a vital step toward peace in the Middle East.

News article:
A recent New York Times magazine article by David Samuels detailed how White House advisor Ben Rhodes convinced you, Mr. President, to embark on a deceptive campaign to sell the Iran nuclear deal to Congress and the American people. The article describes how your administration told the American people that it was critical to make a change in our policy with Iran now and pursue serious negotiations because there was a “new political reality in Iran.” We were told, “moderates” came into power as of 2013 and we needed to take advantage of that reality. In actuality, this idea, that moderates are in power, “was largely manufactured for the purpose of selling the deal.” Negotiations were well under way even before so-called “moderate” Hassan Rouhani was elected as President of Iran. So, your administration misled us about when it actually started negotiations with the Iranian regime, and about whom it was dealing with. The administration was unequivocally negotiating with hardliners. However, perhaps the more damning revelation in the article is not what your administration did with respect to its actions with Iran. It is what your administration did with respect to the American people, the United States Congress, and our alliances with other nations. The article states: “By obtaining broad public currency for the thought that there was a significant split in the regime, and that the administration was reaching out to moderate-minded Iranians who wanted peaceful relations with the neighbors and with America, Obama was able to evade what might have otherwise been a divisive but clarifying debate over the actual policy choices that his administration was making. By eliminating the fuss about Iran’s nuclear program, the administration hoped to eliminate a source of structural tension between the two countries, which would create the space for America to disentangle itself from its established system of alliances with countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel and Turkey. With one bold move, the administration would effectively begin the process of a large-scale disengagement from the Middle East.” The utter disregard and arrogance that this administration has shown for the American people and Congress reveals its disdainful attitude – one unbecoming and completely inappropriate for the President of the United States. Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications, actually believes that policy makers in this country are incapable of rational debate—“I mean, I’d prefer a sober, reasoned public debate, after which members of Congress reflect and take a vote, but that’s impossible.” In believing this, though, Mr. Rhodes ensured that we did not have that opportunity. They took advantage of the fact that most newspapers no longer have foreign bureaus, so the reporters are largely ignorant of what is happening on the ground. Or, as Mr. Rhodes describes the situation, “they literally know nothing.” Mr. Rhodes stated that reporters now call the White House to find out what is going on. And, the White House is happy to oblige, with its own set of facts. This administration set up a “war room” and framed the deal as a choice between peace and war, it made sure “that no potential negative comment passed without a tweet,” and created an “echo chamber” that ensured what was stated and restated were “things that validated what [they] had given them to say.” Of President Obama, one senior official said, “He is a brilliant guy, but he has a real problem with what I call the assignment of bad faith. He regards everyone on the other side at this point as being a bunch of bloodthirsty know-nothings from a different era who play by the old book.” Instead of bringing Democrats and Republicans together, your administration has so divided the parties that I have had to withdraw my amendments (seeking to prohibit the use of federal funds to purchase Iran’s overproduced heavy water, which is in violation of the Iran deal) due to the threat that all Democrats, at your behest, will vote against the overall bill, the National Defense Authorization Act. Read the backstory here. So, the White House took it upon itself to “eliminate the fuss” about the nuclear program of Iran, and while denying it, move toward what it saw as the more critical step: to disengage the United States from the Middle East and dissolve or at least call into question our alliances with countries that we have typically had friendly relations with. Mr. President, you cleverly killed two birds on your agenda with the single stone of the Iranian nuclear deal—boosting Iran’s influence and withdrawing the U.S. from the Middle East. The problem is, you and your advisors never admitted until now that you were doing this so, it was never honestly debated. These are the kinds of momentous decisions that should be debated on fact and evidence. The future of the world is at stake, and while an “echo chamber” may manipulate public opinion, that doesn’t change reality and it doesn’t show respect for the American people to compete with a true global threat. Unfortunately, in this life, we have to deal with the facts as they are, not what we want them to be. Wishing for Iran to be a responsible actor or for an unstable world to become stable in a vacuum does not make it so. It will be up to the next President, working with Congress as an equal partner and dealing honestly with the American people, to clean up the mess that inevitably comes when America withdraws from the world. Congressman Doug Lamborn represents the Fifth District of Colorado. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, he currently serves as the Vice Chairman of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, and is also a member of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities.

News article:
WASHINGTON (AP) — A group the White House recently identified as a key surrogate in selling the Iran nuclear deal gave National Public Radio $100,000 last year to help it report on the pact and related issues, according to the group’s annual report. It also funded reporters and partnerships with other news outlets. The Ploughshares Fund’s mission is to “build a safe, secure world by developing and investing in initiatives to reduce and ultimately eliminate the world’s nuclear stockpiles,” one that dovetails with President Barack Obama’s arms control efforts. But its behind-the-scenes role advocating for the Iran agreement got more attention this month after a candid profile of Ben Rhodes, one of the president’s top foreign policy aides. In The New York Times Magazine article, Rhodes explained how the administration worked with nongovernmental organizations, proliferation experts and even friendly reporters to build support for the seven-nation accord that curtailed Iran’s nuclear activity and softened international financial penalties on Tehran. “We created an echo chamber,” said Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, adding that “outside groups like Ploughshares” helped carry out the administration’s message effectively. The magazine piece revived Republican criticism of the Iran agreement as they suggested it was evidence of a White House spin machine misleading the American people. The administration accused opponents of trying to re-litigate the deal after failing to defeat it in congressional votes last year. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Outside groups of all stripes are increasingly giving money to news organizations for special projects or general news coverage. Most news organizations, including The Associated Press, have strict rules governing whom they can accept money from and how to protect journalistic independence. Ploughshares’ backing is more unusual, given its prominent role in the rancorous, partisan debate over the Iran deal. The Ploughshares grant to NPR supported “national security reporting that emphasizes the themes of US nuclear weapons policy and budgets, Iran’s nuclear program, international nuclear security topics and US policy toward nuclear security,” according to Ploughshares’ 2015 annual report, recently published online. Advertisement “It is common practice for foundations to fund media coverage of underreported stories,” Ploughshares spokeswoman Jennifer Abrahamson said. Funding “does not influence the editorial content of their coverage in any way, nor would we want it to.” Ploughshares has funded NPR’s coverage of national security since 2005, the radio network said. Ploughshares reports show at least $700,000 in funding over that time. All grant descriptions since 2010 specifically mention Iran. “It’s a valued partnership, without any conditions from Ploughshares on our specific reporting, beyond the broad issues of national and nuclear security, nuclear policy, and nonproliferation,” NPR said in an emailed statement. “As with all support received, we have a rigorous editorial firewall process in place to ensure our coverage is independent and is not influenced by funders or special interests.” Republican lawmakers will have concerns nonetheless, especially as Congress supplies NPR with a small portion of its funding. Just this week, the GOP-controlled House Oversight Committee tried to summon Rhodes to a hearing entitled “White House Narratives on the Iran Nuclear Deal,” but he refused. Ploughshares’ links to media are “tremendously troubling,” said Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas, an Iran-deal critic. Pompeo told the AP he repeatedly asked NPR to be interviewed last year as a counterweight to a Democratic supporter of the agreement, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who he said regularly appeared on the station. But NPR refused to put Pompeo on the air, he said. The station said it had no record of Pompeo’s requests, and listed several prominent Republicans who were featured speaking about the deal or economic sanctions on Iran. Advertisement Another who appeared on NPR is Joseph Cirincione, Ploughshares’ president. He spoke about the negotiations on air at least twice last year. The station identified Ploughshares as an NPR funder one of those times; the other time, it didn’t. Ploughshares boasts of helping to secure the deal. While success was “driven by the fearless leadership of the Obama administration and supporters in Congress,” board chairwoman Mary Lloyd Estrin wrote in the annual report, “less known is the absolutely critical role that civil society played in tipping the scales towards this extraordinary policy victory.” The 33-page document lists the groups that Ploughshares funded last year to advance its nonproliferation agenda. The Arms Control Association got $282,500; the Brookings Institution, $225,000; and the Atlantic Council, $182,500. They received money for Iran-related analysis, briefings and media outreach, and non-Iran nuclear work. Other groups, less directly defined by their independent nuclear expertise, also secured grants. J-Street, the liberal Jewish political action group, received $576,500 to advocate for the deal. More than $281,000 went to the National Iranian American Council. Princeton University got $70,000 to support former Iranian ambassador and nuclear spokesman Seyed Hossein Mousavian’s “analysis, publications and policymaker engagement on the range of elements involved with the negotiated settlement of Iran’s nuclear program.” Ploughshares has set its sights on other media organizations, too. Advertisement In a “Cultural Strategy Report” on its website, the group outlined a broader objective of “ensuring regular and accurate coverage of nuclear issues in reputable and strategic media outlets” such as The Guardian, Salon, the Huffington Post or Pro Publica. Previous efforts failed to generate enough coverage, it noted. These included “funding of reporters at The Nation and Mother Jones and a partnership with The Center for Public Integrity to create a national security desk.” It suggested using “web videos, podcasts, photo-based stories” and other “attention-grabbing formats” for “creatively reframing the issue.” The Center for Public Integrity’s CEO, Peter Bale, confirmed the grant. “None of the funding received by Ploughshares was for coverage of the Iran deal,” said Bale, whose company received $70,000. “In general, we avoided that subject because the topic did not lend itself to the type of investigative reporting the Center does.” Caitlin Graf, a spokeswoman at The Nation, said her outlet had no partnership with Ploughshares. She referred queries to The Nation Institute, a nonprofit associated with the magazine that seeks to strengthen the independent press and advance social justice. Taya Kitman, the institute’s director, said Ploughshares’ one-year grant supported reporting on US-Iran policy, but strict editorial control was maintained. Mother Jones’ media department didn’t respond to several messages seeking comment. The AP has taken grants from nonpolitical groups and journalism foundations such as the Knight Foundation. As with all grants, “AP retains complete editorial control of the final news product, which must fully meet AP standards for independence and integrity,” Standards Editor Thomas Kent said.

News article:
May 25, 2016 The Obama administration has spent months suggesting it would support a key Iran sanctions bill when the time is ripe. Not anymore. In back-to-back appearances May 25 in the House and Senate, the State Department's point man on implementation of the nuclear deal flatly declined to endorse renewal of the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) before it expires in December. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle say the secondary sanctions on Iran's energy sector give the administration international penalties to "snap back" to if Iran reneges on its obligations under the deal, but the administration disagrees. "Having the ISA in place or not is not necessary for snapping back. We have sufficient authority through various executive orders," Stephen Mull told the Senate Banking Committee. "The administration is ready to work with the Congress on [reauthorization]. We would have to see what form it would take. ... There have been various, slightly different variations in how it would be renewed, so we would certainly be willing to have that conversation." The evasive response infuriated Iran deal skeptics on both sides of the aisle after they repeatedly asked Mull about his views on a straight-up extension of the current law. Some accused the administration of a bait-and-switch to help sell the deal to Congress. "You seem very wishy-washy, as you have been in multiple settings. And it's very off-putting," said banking panel member and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn. "Either you support the Iran Sanctions Act being extended, or you don't." Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., the co-author of pending legislation to extend the current law by 10 years with a few extra reporting requirements, also grilled Mull. Menendez asked if straight-up reauthorization would be a violation of the nuclear deal, prompting Mull to answer, "We would have to look at that at the time that it was submitted." "That contravenes everything that we were told at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee," Menendez replied. "I cannot fathom for the life of me how we don't embrace authorizing it as it is so that at the end of the day the Iranians know that if in the out-years [of the deal] there is any violation, there is immediate snap-back to the most significant sanctions that exist." During and immediately after passage of the nuclear deal, administration officials urged lawmakers not to immediately reauthorize the sanctions law so as to avoid needlessly antagonizing the Iranians. That argument has lost any traction, however, as Congress quickly burns through its few remaining legislating days in this election year. "We absolutely support renewal of the ISA," a senior official told Politico in August 2015. “It’s an important piece of legislation, and we want to discuss renewal with Congress in a thoughtful way at the right time." The administration denies any flat-out change of heart. "We remain committed to working with Congress," State Department official Sam Werberg told Al-Monitor in an emailed statement, "and are willing to discuss how to further foreign policy priorities in a manner that does not jeopardize JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] implementation." Mull had similar exchanges with the House Foreign Affairs Committee earlier in the day, when he was also repeatedly pressed on the law's extension. Lawmakers across the ideological spectrum — from nuclear deal cheerleader Gerry Connolly, D-Va., to hard-core opponent Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y. — told Al-Monitor that the May 25 hearing was the closest they'd heard the administration come to opposing the Iran Sanctions Act's reauthorization. "The awful attempts at non-answers just leave everyone wondering what their real motives and plans are," Zeldin said. Mull's job is implementation of the Iran deal, while any larger decisions about whether to support or oppose sanctions legislation lie squarely with the White House. He may have sought to avoid committing to a course of action that's ultimately outside his wheelhouse. In addition, some lawmakers have made no secret of trying to use the Iran Sanctions Act renewal, which will likely be a relatively easy sell in Congress, to tack on extra measures. Still, few seemed to buy Mull's apparent argument that the mere possibility of such an outcome should preclude him from supporting a clean reauthorization. "I don't think that's a valid concern," House Foreign Affairs member and nuclear deal opponent Brad Sherman, D-Calif., told Al-Monitor. "That's like saying you can't be in favor of apples because somebody may turn it into a pumpkin. If you're endorsing apples, you're not endorsing pumpkins." While there's broad agreement in Congress that the Obama administration may be uncomfortable with anti-Iran legislative activity post-deal, the conclusions drawn have a partisan tilt. Zeldin suspects the White House would like nothing more than to see the legislation expire. "The impression that I got was that the White House is playing a game where they want the Iran Sanctions Act to expire at the end of the year and then be able to blame Congress," he told Al-Monitor. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-Calif., shared similar concerns. "The continued reluctance to reauthorizing the Iran Sanctions Act is a prime example of how the White House’s Iran policy amounts to walking on eggshells," Royce told Al-Monitor in an emailed statement. "Extending this act is essential to keep the pressure on Iran and ensure that Congress, not the president, has the final say on sanctions relief.” Sherman by contrast believes the Obama administration would perhaps prefer that the bill's sanctions authorities endure, just without a noisy congressional debate that would surely upset Tehran. "If it somehow happened automatically, if there was a bill that said that any law passed on such-and-such a date shall last four more years, I don't know if they'd oppose it," Sherman said. "If it somehow just happened, they might be happy. But the idea of us actually passing it doesn't bring them great joy."

In addition, some lawmakers have made no secret of trying to use the Iran Sanctions Act renewal, which will likely be a relatively easy sell in Congress, to tack on extra measures. Still, few seemed to buy Mull's apparent argument that the mere possibility of such an outcome should preclude him from supporting a clean reauthorization. "I don't think that's a valid concern," House Foreign Affairs member and nuclear deal opponent Brad Sherman, D-Calif., told Al-Monitor. "That's like saying you can't be in favor of apples because somebody may turn it into a pumpkin. If you're endorsing apples, you're not endorsing pumpkins." While there's broad agreement in Congress that the Obama administration may be uncomfortable with anti-Iran legislative activity post-deal, the conclusions drawn have a partisan tilt. Zeldin suspects the White House would like nothing more than to see the legislation expire. "The impression that I got was that the White House is playing a game where they want the Iran Sanctions Act to expire at the end of the year and then be able to blame Congress," he told Al-Monitor. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-Calif., shared similar concerns. "The continued reluctance to reauthorizing the Iran Sanctions Act is a prime example of how the White House’s Iran policy amounts to walking on eggshells," Royce told Al-Monitor in an emailed statement. "Extending this act is essential to keep the pressure on Iran and ensure that Congress, not the president, has the final say on sanctions relief.” Sherman by contrast believes the Obama administration would perhaps prefer that the bill's sanctions authorities endure, just without a noisy congressional debate that would surely upset Tehran. "If it somehow happened automatically, if there was a bill that said that any law passed on such-and-such a date shall last four more years, I don't know if they'd oppose it," Sherman said. "If it somehow just happened, they might be happy. But the idea of us actually passing it doesn't bring them great joy."

News article:
Israeli Premier Yitzhak Shamir urged Egypt Wednesday to convince its fellow Arab countries to enter into direct negotiations with Israel. “Egypt, a partner to the Camp David Accords, could play a significant role by encouraging our other neighbors to follow her example and enter into face-to-face talks with us without preconditions,” Shamir said after a meeting and working lunch with President Reagan at the White House. While both Reagan and Shamir, in their statements in front of the White House’s diplomatic entrance, stressed that peace can be achieved only through direct negotiations, the two leaders publicly stated their differences over an international conference. “Our goal now is setting in motion a process acceptable by Israel and its neighbors which can lead to a comprehensive settlement,” Reagan said. He said this requires “bilateral negotiations,” adding that any “reasonable” method of bringing about such negotiations should be explored, “including an international conference.” Shamir, however, said the “only viable cornerstone to peace” is the method used by Israel and Egypt in achieving the Camp David Accords. “We renew the call to our neighbors to join us in direct negotiations for the obtaining of peace between us,” he said. DIFFERENCES ON AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM The Israeli Premier was more direct Tuesday after his meeting at the State Department with Secretary of State George Shultz, when he called the idea of an international forum “a Soviet-inspired notion supported by radical Arab nations.” He said such a conference, demanded by King Hussein of Jordan, “will not bring peace to our area.” Shultz, admitting that the United States and Israel do not see “eye-to-eye” on this issue, said the U.S. believes that “all options” that could bring about direct negotiations should be explored, including an international conference. “Our objective is not an international conference, our objective is direct negotiations,” Shultz stressed. Shamir differs on this issue with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who believes an international conference may be the only way to bring Jordan into talks with Israel. A senior Administration official, briefing reporters Wednesday on Shamir’s talks with Shultz and Reagan, said that the U.S. is not trying to “play one side” in the Israeli government against the other. He said the U.S. deals with the national unity government, headed by Shamir, as it did when Peres was Peres was Premier. ‘REPRESENTATIVE PALESTINIANS’ MUST BE INCLUDED Both Reagan and Shultz stressed that any negotiations must include “representative Palestinians.” Shamir also agreed Tuesday that negotiations should include “representatives of Palestinians living in the area.” This apparently meant Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, rather than from outside. Reagan and Shamir also said they discussed the situation of Soviet Jewry. “We took note of recent releases, but are waiting to see the gates truly opened for Jewish emigration,” Reagan said. Shamir said Israel was “grateful” for Reagan’s efforts on behalf of “our brothers and sisters” in the USSR. He said the Soviet Union must continue to be pressed “to let all our people return to our ancient homeland, the land of Israel.” IRAN ISSUE DISCUSSED Iran was discussed by Shamir with both Reagan and Shultz. Reagan said it was agreed that Iran should be encouraged to end terrorism and the use of force. He added that it was also agreed that it was important to “look to the future instead of dwelling on the past.” Shamir said Tuesday that while Iran was a leading supporter of terrorism, it was an important country in the Mideast and indicated that ways should be found to exert “influence” on it. As for the U.S. sale of arms to Iran, Shultz said this was an American decision. The Administration official briefing reporters Wednesday said that Israel has agreed to cooperate with the various American investigations of the Iranian arms sales. OTHER ISSUES DISCUSSED Both Reagan and Shamir pointed to the U.S. decision to give Israel the status of a “major non-NATO ally,” which allows it to bid on Defense Department research and development contracts. Shamir called this a “new dimension to our relations.” Also discussed Tuesday and Wednesday was the Israeli economy and Israel’s agreement to allow the U.S. to build a relay station for the Voice of America in Israel. Not discussed, according to officials, was the case of Jonathan Pollard who was awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to spying for Israel. When Shamir was asked about the Pollard case Tuesday, he called it “a very painful experience” for Israel and said spying on the U.S. was “not a policy of the Israeli government.” Shamir concluded his remarks to Reagan Wednesday by noting that this year was the 200th anniversary of the U.S. constitution and the 90th anniversary of the Zionist movement. “Both events have enriched the quality of our lives,” he said. “They are the roots of our present relationship, joint efforts, our dreams and our confidence in the future.”

News article:
The Cabinet called on Egypt today to continue the Jarring talks “in order to reach a peace agreement between the two states.” Contrary to some expectations, the Cabinet did not attach the condition that such talks be face-to-face, thus leaving Cairo free to continue the indirect procedure applied to date. But the policymakers stated unequivocally that Israel “will not” restore the pre-Six-Day War borders of June 4, 1967. The resolution issued by the Cabinet today followed a debate that had begun at a special meeting last Thursday. In the resolution, the Cabinet declared that “the government of Israel views favorably the expression of the readiness of the government of Egypt to enter into a peace agreement with Israel, and expresses its own readiness for meaningful negotiations on all subjects relevant to a peace agreement between the two countries.” It was reported late last week that in its Feb. 15 aide memoire to United Nations negotiator Dr. Gunnar V. Jarring, Cairo for the first time indicated a willingness to effect a peace “agreement”–but not a peace “treaty” with Israel. The Cabinet said today that “the government of Israel hopes for a positive response by Egypt and for progress in the negotiations.” The resolution remarked that “the Egyptian note demonstrates the concrete differences between Egypt’s positions and those of Israel, and particularly the substantial gap which exists on the issues of borders and refugees.” it noted in this connection that “Egypt demands total withdrawal to the armistice lines, while the position of Israel is…that it will be ready to discuss the withdrawal of armed forces towards secure, recognized and agreed boundaries to be established in peace agreements.” The negotiations, the Cabinet stressed, “should not be subject to prior commitments on the outstanding issues,” But the key phrase in the Cabinet resolution was that Israel “views favorably…the readiness of…Egypt to enter into a peace agreement with Israel.” The question of what to say in the statement was thrashed out informally over the weekend by Premier Golda Meir, her senior Cabinet colleagues and Yitzhak Rabin, ambassador to the United States. Rabin, who arrived here Friday on urgent summons, reportedly conveyed to Mrs. Meir his distinct impression that if Israel rejected Egypt’s offer she would run the risk of losing American support. (At the airport on his arrival, Rabin told newsmen he was unaware of any special American pressure, but added: “It depends what you regard as pressure.”) ALLON, EBAN, SAPIR FAVOR ACCEPTING SADAT’S PROPOSAL; MRS. MEIR, GALILI OPPOSED It was understood that Mrs. Meir and her confidant, Minister Without-Portfolio Israel Galili, were against accepting Cairo’s offer, whereas Deputy Premier Yigal Allon, Foreign Minister Abba Eban and Finance Minister Pinhas Sapir favored acceptance. The current position of mercurial Defense Minister Moshe Dayan is not known for certain. But despite doubts about Egypt’s sincerity, the Israeli government welcomed its willingness to conclude a peace pact of some kind. A Foreign Ministry spokesman commented to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency today that Israel would never agree to restrict Jewish immigration, even if it meant the foundering of the peace talks. Egypt’s UN ambassador, Dr. Mohammed H. el Zayyat, was quoted in a New York daily last week as endorsing the sovereignty of a Jewish State of Israel if her government stopped the influx of Jews. The alleged remark gave rise to speculation that such a proposal was included in Cairo’s Feb. 15 message to Dr. Jarring. But Dr. Zayyat immediately told the JTA that the published story was “non-sense,” and reliable sources confirmed today that the Egyptian message made no mention of immigrants. Meanwhile, political circles in Jerusalem said Jordan would soon approve Dr. Jarring’s reported suggestion that Amman sign a peace accord with Israel after some territorial adjustments. And in another development, the Interparty Secretariat Against Withdrawal From Administered Territories–composed of Knesset members and professionals of all parties–urged the Meir administration to reject any demand for an unconditional pullback from the areas captured in the Six-Day War.

News article:
Israel’s Foreign Minister Abba Eban said last night that there were two concrete issues that could be the starting point for peace negotiations between Israel and Egypt–Sharm el-Sheikh and the establishment of a balance of forces in the Middle East. But he said the responsibility for starting peace talks belonged to Egypt since it was that country that initiated the belligerency of 1967. Eban made his remarks in a 45-minute telephone interview with six senior French journalists which was broadcast by Inter-Paris, the most popular French radio network shortly before the main evening news broadcast. The interview was wide-ranging and included an admission by Eban that there have been unofficial contacts between Israel and the Soviet Union but that there could be no improvement in relations between the two countries as long as Moscow persisted in its anti-Israel policies. Eban also dismissed China as a “decisive factor in the Middle East” and observed that “the really important Nixon talks on the Middle East are not taking place in Peking” but “will be taking place soon in Moscow,” a reference to President Nixon’s summit visit to the Soviet capital this May. As far as the Middle East is concerned “there are only two powers which count, the United States and the Soviet Union,” Eban said. The Interview was the first appearance by a prominent Israeli statesman or public personality on the French radio in recent years. It seemed to indicate a change in form, if not in content, of French policy toward Israel. But the Israeli Foreign Minister was not optimistic about the future of Franco-Israeli relations and listed the serious obstacles in the way of improvement. POWER BALANCE THROUGH DEMILITARIZATION Eban said that peace talks with Egypt hinged on two “crucial” points. The balance of power, he said, could be advanced appreciably through demilitarization of the Sinai peninsula. “A lot depends on the Egyptians. If they show themselves supple and conciliatory an agreement on borders can also be arranged,” he said. He said, however, that Israel must retain permanent control of Sharm el-Sheikh in view of what happened in 1967. “We have told this to Egypt in the past and we shall continue to tell her so frankly,” Eban said. He said that Egypt now commands the necessary prestige to enable it to initiate peace talks and is recognized in this position by both the US and the Soviet Union. He said that Russia’s position is somewhat changed as Moscow now agrees that there can be no Israeli withdrawal without “a real peace being signed.” But the Soviet Union still blocks a solution by opposing “territorial negotiations,” he added. Eban said, “I would much prefer a change of Soviet policy without secret contacts than secret contacts and no change of Russian policy.” He said that China’s presence in the Middle East was mainly in the field of propaganda. OBSTACLES TO ISRAELI-FRANCO AMITY Referring to Israel’s problems with France, Eban said he was a “realist,” and that while the friction point of the Mirage dispute has now been solved, there are still two major obstacles in the way of improved Franco-Israeli relations. One is France’s refusal to agree to Israel’s request to come to an agreement with the European Common Market which would safeguard its exports to Europe. The other is that France is the only West European country that has expressly stated that Israel should “evacuate all the occupied territories.” According to Eban, “Such a prerequisite cuts off the venue to all possible compromise solutions and this actually prevents a start to negotiations.” Asked about the Palestinian problem, Eban said that “had to be settled by the Arabs themselves.” He observed that “as far as Israel is concerned, we would be glad to live alongside a Palestinian state but this is for them to decide, not for us.” Eban claimed that the Soviet Union “has decided to allow Jewish emigration for two reasons: because it has come to realize that it cannot smother by force their Jewishness and because of the intensity of protests throughout the world’s progressive circles about this issue.”

The other is that France is the only West European country that has expressly stated that Israel should “evacuate all the occupied territories.” According to Eban, “Such a prerequisite cuts off the venue to all possible compromise solutions and this actually prevents a start to negotiations.” Asked about the Palestinian problem, Eban said that “had to be settled by the Arabs themselves.” He observed that “as far as Israel is concerned, we would be glad to live alongside a Palestinian state but this is for them to decide, not for us.” Eban claimed that the Soviet Union “has decided to allow Jewish emigration for two reasons: because it has come to realize that it cannot smother by force their Jewishness and because of the intensity of protests throughout the world’s progressive circles about this issue.”

News article:
Israel’s Foreign Minister Abba Eban said last night that there were two concrete issues that could be the starting point for peace negotiations between Israel and Egypt–Sharm el-Sheikh and the establishment of a balance of forces in the Middle East. But he said the responsibility for starting peace talks belonged to Egypt since it was that country that initiated the belligerency of 1967. Eban made his remarks in a 45-minute telephone interview with six senior French journalists which was broadcast by Inter-Paris, the most popular French radio network shortly before the main evening news broadcast. The interview was wide-ranging and included an admission by Eban that there have been unofficial contacts between Israel and the Soviet Union but that there could be no improvement in relations between the two countries as long as Moscow persisted in its anti-Israel policies. Eban also dismissed China as a “decisive factor in the Middle East” and observed that “the really important Nixon talks on the Middle East are not taking place in Peking” but “will be taking place soon in Moscow,” a reference to President Nixon’s summit visit to the Soviet capital this May. As far as the Middle East is concerned “there are only two powers which count, the United States and the Soviet Union,” Eban said. The Interview was the first appearance by a prominent Israeli statesman or public personality on the French radio in recent years. It seemed to indicate a change in form, if not in content, of French policy toward Israel. But the Israeli Foreign Minister was not optimistic about the future of Franco-Israeli relations and listed the serious obstacles in the way of improvement. POWER BALANCE THROUGH DEMILITARIZATION Eban said that peace talks with Egypt hinged on two “crucial” points. The balance of power, he said, could be advanced appreciably through demilitarization of the Sinai peninsula. “A lot depends on the Egyptians. If they show themselves supple and conciliatory an agreement on borders can also be arranged,” he said. He said, however, that Israel must retain permanent control of Sharm el-Sheikh in view of what happened in 1967. “We have told this to Egypt in the past and we shall continue to tell her so frankly,” Eban said. He said that Egypt now commands the necessary prestige to enable it to initiate peace talks and is recognized in this position by both the US and the Soviet Union. He said that Russia’s position is somewhat changed as Moscow now agrees that there can be no Israeli withdrawal without “a real peace being signed.” But the Soviet Union still blocks a solution by opposing “territorial negotiations,” he added. Eban said, “I would much prefer a change of Soviet policy without secret contacts than secret contacts and no change of Russian policy.” He said that China’s presence in the Middle East was mainly in the field of propaganda. OBSTACLES TO ISRAELI-FRANCO AMITY Referring to Israel’s problems with France, Eban said he was a “realist,” and that while the friction point of the Mirage dispute has now been solved, there are still two major obstacles in the way of improved Franco-Israeli relations. One is France’s refusal to agree to Israel’s request to come to an agreement with the European Common Market which would safeguard its exports to Europe. The other is that France is the only West European country that has expressly stated that Israel should “evacuate all the occupied territories.” According to Eban, “Such a prerequisite cuts off the venue to all possible compromise solutions and this actually prevents a start to negotiations.” Asked about the Palestinian problem, Eban said that “had to be settled by the Arabs themselves.” He observed that “as far as Israel is concerned, we would be glad to live alongside a Palestinian state but this is for them to decide, not for us.” Eban claimed that the Soviet Union “has decided to allow Jewish emigration for two reasons: because it has come to realize that it cannot smother by force their Jewishness and because of the intensity of protests throughout the world’s progressive circles about this issue.”

News article:
Israel is sending Egypt revised proposals for a joint declaration of principles. The new draft, submitted to U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Alfred L. Atherton this morning by Premier Menachem Begin and Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan, was said to contain new elements. Atherton, who declined to say what progress if any, has been made in the course of his shuttle diplomacy so far, did observe that there are “each time some new ideas that provide some new basis for progress.” He said the U.S. would submit its own ideas if necessary. He will take the latest Israeli proposals to Cairo tomorrow and return to Israel Thursday, presumably with Egypt’s response.” Obviously, there is still a gap. If there were no gap, the negotiations would have been completed,” Atherton told reporters. Begin spoke to newsmen later, on emerging from a meeting with visiting British Foreign Secretary David Owen. He said there was “reason to assume” that the negotiating process would continue, and Owen concurred. The British diplomat said Begin has not toughened the peace proposals he outlined to British leaders after his visit to the U.S. last December. “I have always thought that Sadat and Begin were resolved to have peace,” Owen said. HARDENING OF POSITIONS NOTED However, Israeli sources claimed there has been a hardening of the Egyptian position. Begin made it clear that there was no flexibility on the Israeli side either, on the question of the Palestinians and total withdrawal by Israel from occupied Arab territories. Commenting on Egypt’s proposals for a joint declaration which Atherton brought here from Cairo last week, Begin said: “Some of the paragraphs suggested to us can be negotiated. One paragraph is acceptable since it is identical with the Israeli draft. But we made it absolutely clear that total withdrawal to the 1967 borders or the creation of a Palestinian state were not acceptable to us.” Some observers noted that Begin spoke of a “Palestinian state” as unacceptable but did not mention Palestinian “self-determination,” which Israel also has rejected up to now. President Carter, in his Jan. 4 Aswan formula, proposed that the Palestinians be given the opportunity to participate in the determination of their future. Israel accepted that formulation but says now that Egypt has retreated from it. Atherton told reporters, as he has in the past, that he was “not going to characterize each discussion in terms of progress or no progress.” “But,” he said, “I have to add that there are each time some new ideas that provide some new basis for progress.” ROLE OF JORDAN Owen arrived in Israel from Jordan yesterday for a two-day official visit. It was seen as timely because of Britain’s close links to Jordan and that kingdom’s crucial role in the peace process which it has yet to join. According to Dayan and other observers, Jordan’s continued absence from peace talks is the most serious obstacle to further progress and President Anwar Sadat of Egypt seems to be making the resumption of the political talks conditional on Jordan’s involvement. Owen said on his arrival that Jordan felt the talks to date were “bilateral” and would consider joining them only if real progress was evident. He said he thought that attitude was “not unreasonable.” Owen also noted that Israel’s peace plan was presented originally as a scheme “for five years,” subject to review after that period. This important aspect seems to be “lost sight of,” he said, at least in some Arab quarters where Israel’s proposals “tended to be seen as permanent.” He urged emphasis on the five-year aspect of the Israeli plan. Asked whether Jordan would be prepared to break with Syria in order to join the Israeli-Egyptian negotiations, Owen said, “I think they are not going to make up their mind until they see a declaration of principles and until they get greater clarifications. I think they are very cautious about this and I think they don’t believe it necessarily requires breaking from Syria.” Owen met in Amman with Crown Prince Hassan. He conferred informally with King Hussein in London last week where the Jordanian monarch was on a private visit.

Israel is sending Egypt revised proposals for a joint declaration of principles. The new draft, submitted to U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Alfred L. Atherton this morning by Premier Menachem Begin and Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan, was said to contain new elements. Atherton, who declined to say what progress if any, has been made in the course of his shuttle diplomacy so far, did observe that there are “each time some new ideas that provide some new basis for progress.” He said the U.S. would submit its own ideas if necessary. He will take the latest Israeli proposals to Cairo tomorrow and return to Israel Thursday, presumably with Egypt’s response.” Obviously, there is still a gap. If there were no gap, the negotiations would have been completed,” Atherton told reporters. Begin spoke to newsmen later, on emerging from a meeting with visiting British Foreign Secretary David Owen. He said there was “reason to assume” that the negotiating process would continue, and Owen concurred. The British diplomat said Begin has not toughened the peace proposals he outlined to British leaders after his visit to the U.S. last December. “I have always thought that Sadat and Begin were resolved to have peace,” Owen said. HARDENING OF POSITIONS NOTED However, Israeli sources claimed there has been a hardening of the Egyptian position. Begin made it clear that there was no flexibility on the Israeli side either, on the question of the Palestinians and total withdrawal by Israel from occupied Arab territories. Commenting on Egypt’s proposals for a joint declaration which Atherton brought here from Cairo last week, Begin said: “Some of the paragraphs suggested to us can be negotiated. One paragraph is acceptable since it is identical with the Israeli draft. But we made it absolutely clear that total withdrawal to the 1967 borders or the creation of a Palestinian state were not acceptable to us.” Some observers noted that Begin spoke of a “Palestinian state” as unacceptable but did not mention Palestinian “self-determination,” which Israel also has rejected up to now. President Carter, in his Jan. 4 Aswan formula, proposed that the Palestinians be given the opportunity to participate in the determination of their future. Israel accepted that formulation but says now that Egypt has retreated from it. Atherton told reporters, as he has in the past, that he was “not going to characterize each discussion in terms of progress or no progress.” “But,” he said, “I have to add that there are each time some new ideas that provide some new basis for progress.” ROLE OF JORDAN Owen arrived in Israel from Jordan yesterday for a two-day official visit. It was seen as timely because of Britain’s close links to Jordan and that kingdom’s crucial role in the peace process which it has yet to join. According to Dayan and other observers, Jordan’s continued absence from peace talks is the most serious obstacle to further progress and President Anwar Sadat of Egypt seems to be making the resumption of the political talks conditional on Jordan’s involvement. Owen said on his arrival that Jordan felt the talks to date were “bilateral” and would consider joining them only if real progress was evident. He said he thought that attitude was “not unreasonable.” Owen also noted that Israel’s peace plan was presented originally as a scheme “for five years,” subject to review after that period. This important aspect seems to be “lost sight of,” he said, at least in some Arab quarters where Israel’s proposals “tended to be seen as permanent.” He urged emphasis on the five-year aspect of the Israeli plan. Asked whether Jordan would be prepared to break with Syria in order to join the Israeli-Egyptian negotiations, Owen said, “I think they are not going to make up their mind until they see a declaration of principles and until they get greater clarifications. I think they are very cautious about this and I think they don’t believe it necessarily requires breaking from Syria.” Owen met in Amman with Crown Prince Hassan. He conferred informally with King Hussein in London last week where the Jordanian monarch was on a private visit.

News article:
Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan blamed Egypt last night for the current impasse in peace talks with Israel and said his country preferred direct negotiations and practical discussions of mutual proposals with the Egyptians to the present contacts through an American intermediary. Addressing the 29th World Zionist Congress, Dayan claimed there are no direct negotiations with Egypt now because the Egyptians do not want or cannot conduct such negotiations without the participation of Jordan and other Arab countries. He also accused Cairo of toughening its stand and backing away from original positions. He said the current negotiations through American mediation was contrary to the understanding reached by Premier Menachem Begin and President Anwar Sadat at their Christmas Day meeting in Ismailia last year. According to Dayan, the Egyptians promised then to present counter-proposals to Israel’s peace plan for Sinai and the West Bank, but so far they have not done so. “It is hard to tell whether the Egyptians believed at the beginning of negotiations that they would eventually reach a separate agreement with Israel,” Dayan said. At the moment, he told the Congress delegates, negotiations are concentrated on the Palestinian issue and the future of the West Bank and there is no discussion of bilateral matters between the two countries. Dayan said Israel did not object to President Carter’s Jan. 4 Aswan formula that called for Palestinian Arab participation in determining their own future. “Israel is willing to sit with them and to discuss with them their future,” Dayan said. He claimed, however, that “it is quite obvious that when they speak of their future they mean that they will determine our future.” He said Israel would never allow the Palestinian Arabs to determine the future of its settlements in the occupied Arab territories.

News article:
The stalemated Middle East peace process took a dramatic turn today with the White House announcement that President Carter will leave Washington Wednesday afternoon for meetings with President Anwar Sadat in Egypt and Premier Menachem Begin in Israel. The President will arrive in Egypt Thursday afternoon and will fly to Israel Saturday night. The White House said his talks in both countries “will focus on the peace process, regional security and bilateral issues.” Only a short while before, the White House announced to the media that Israel had “responded positively” to President Carter’s suggestions to Begin for resolving the issues that block the conclusion of an Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty. The nature of the President’s suggestions was not disclosed. He proposed them to Begin at their meeting yesterday afternoon which appeared, at the time, to be the wind-up of the talks they had been engaged in since Begin’s arrival here last Thursday. The President met with Begin again this morning for about 15 minutes. He also spoke twice to President Sadat by telephone, once before seeing Begin and again after they met. Begin, who held a press conference of his own at Blair House shortly after the White House announcement, welcomed Carter’s visit to Israel and said he would cut short his stay in the U.S. by one day. He will leave for Israel Wednesday afternoon instead of Thursday as originally planned. (See separate story for Begin’s full statement.) CABINET ACCEPTS CARTER’S PROPOSALS The stage was set for today’s rapid developments by an extraordinary meeting of the Israeli Cabinet in Jerusalem this morning. After six hours of intensive debate it voted 9-3 to accept Begin’s recommendations regarding Carter’s latest proposals and authorized him to continue with the negotiations. Four ministers abstained. The Cabinet met as a ministerial security committee and its proceedings were classified. But according to one report from Jerusalem, the President’s new proposals introduced a completely different concept into the peace negotiations; thus setting aside major points of dispute between Israel and Egypt. A White House source told reporters this morning, “I think we have to consider this (the Cabinet’s action) a positive sign. But having said that, it is important to understand that real concern” over the Egyptian-Israeli peace process continues. The source emphasized that “difficult issues remain” and “the consequences of failure” of the Camp David accords are “no less grave now than a few days ago” when Begin arrived in Washington. That point was made again after the announcement that Carter was doing to the Middle East. A White House spokesman said that “obviously one reason” for the President’s trip is “the opportunity to discuss” the “ideas” that he proposed to Begin yesterday. The spokesman stressed that “difficult issues remain to be resolved.” Asked why the President was traveling to the Middle East when Begin is already here, the spokesman said that a “personal visit” by Carter “offers the best hope for success.” NO GUARANTEE OF SUCCESS However, White House Press Secretary Jody Powell, asked if a peace treaty will be signed on this trip, warned: “There is no guarantee of success but it is our feeling that without a major effort such as this the prospects for failure are almost overwhelming.” He said that there were no arrangements at this time for a three-way summit between Carter, Begin and Sadat. Powell also said he did not know when Carter would return, but emphasized there was no indication that Carter would engage in shuttle diplomacy between Cairo and Jerusalem. Israeli officials here also reported that no shuttle diplomacy was being planned by Carter. Earlier, a White House source said the President’s suggestions had not been discussed with Sadat when they spoke by telephone last night. The White House did not disclose what Carter and Sadat had discussed by phone this morning. A source said “As always in proposing suggestions to one side, we will take into consideration the concerns of the other.” The reports of the Israeli Cabinet action created some contusion here. A government spokesman in Jerusalem said the Cabinet had approved Begin’s “recommendations, ” not Carter’s suggestions. It was not known whether or how these differed or if Begin had simply recommended that the President’s proposals be accepted. The Cabinet remained divided. Transport Minister Haim Landau and Health Minister Eliezer Shostak of Likud and Education Minister Zevulun Hammer of the National Religious Party, voted against the recommendations. The four ministers who abstained-were not immediately identified. It was understood in Washington that the President did not offer suggestions concerning all of the five principal treaty elements in dispute between Israel and Egypt The issues on which he made his suggestions were reportedly on linkage and priority of treaty obligations. JEWISH LEADERS HAIL BREAKTHROUGH (In New York, Richard Maass, president of the American Jewish Committee, credited “this critical breakthrough” in the Mideast peace negotiations to “the calm statesmanship shown on the United States and Israeli side in this moment of crisis. President Carter’s perseverance and Premier Begin’s steadfastness found that mutual ground for U.S. Israel understanding which, given the special U.S. Israel relationship and common interest, is essential for progress and greater Middle East stability. Both men are to be congratulated. Let us hope that President Carter will be equally successful in his meeting with President Anwar Sadat in Cairo.”) (Howard M. Squadron, president of the American Jewish Congress, said: “President Carter’s courageous decision to go to Cairo and Jerusalem is heartening evidence of the Administration’s readiness to pursue every avenue that promises peace in the Middle East. The way has not been easy and we wish our President well as he sets forth on his historic, journey this week. He takes with him our blessing and our earnest hope that his bold and imaginative initiative will secure the peace to which we all aspire.”)

News article:
An Israeli official has met in Cairo with Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, marking the first time the two sides have held talks since the Feb. 25 murders of Palestinian worshipers in Hebron. An official close to Rabin confirmed that the secret talks were held Monday in the Egyptian capital in an effort to salvage the Israeli-PLO negotiations, which the Palestinians broke off abruptly after an Israeli settler killed more than 40 Palestinians at morning prayers at the Tomb of the Patriarchs. Jacques Neriah, an adviser to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, presented Arafat with new proposals for security arrangements in the territories in light of the Hebron killings. PLO sources in Tunis told Israel Radio on Monday they expect an Israeli minister to meet with Arafat within a day or two. But Israel Radio also reported that Arafat, following a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amre Moussa, reiterated that the PLO will not resume talks with Israel until the U.N. Security Council issues a condemnation of the Hebron murders. At the United Nations, Israeli sources said the resolution remains stalled over the Palestinian insistence that the resolution be specifically worded to call for an armed international presence in the territories. The sources said the Palestinians are also demanding that Jerusalem be specifically mentioned in reference to the territories. The United States, which has veto power over any Security Council resolution, is supporting Israeli opposition to these two points. Rabin is meanwhile standing firm against the PLO demand for an armed international force in the territories to protect Palestinians living there. Speaking at Hebrew University on Monday, Rabin said he believes an armed presence in the territories would run counter to agreements already negotiated with the PLO and would cast doubt on any agreements reached with them in the future. The self-rule accord signed last September includes a provision for the placement of international observers in the territories, but not for an armed presence. In the wake of the Feb. 25 killings of Palestinians at a Hebron mosque, the PLO has repeatedly called for an armed international presence in the territories. The PLO has also called for the removal of settlements in Hebron and for the disarming of all settlers throughout the territories. Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Monday that Israel would agree to the temporary presence of observers in the territories, from nations that have offered financial assistance to the future Palestinian autonomous area. Peres also said time was of the essence to reach agreement with the PLO. He said the biggest contribution to changing the current climate of tension and mistrust would be implementation of the self-rule accord. “Instead of opening the agreement, let’s realize it, and then all of us will see we do not have an agreement about a piece of paper but we do have an agreement about a new reality,” Peres told the Knesset. Dr. Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli Arab who is an adviser to Arafat, disagreed that the PLO demands violate the agreement between the two sides. “President Arafat and the PLO leadership (are) committed to the peace process,” Tibi said in remarks Monday at Hebrew University. “We are not talking about opening agreements. We are talking about new circumstances that were created after the massacre,” he said. He argued that the most important issue is the security of the Palestinians and said this should be solved as soon as possible if the two sides are to return to the negotiating table. Meanwhile, Israel Radio reported that PLO official Nabil Sha’ath announced that Britain and Norway are ready to participate in an international observer force stationed in the territories under U.N. auspices.

This is the last thing Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi needs: Having Israelis – ministers, Knesset members and economic leaders – running around his territory and taking election selfies or doing business at his expense. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Thirty country leaders, 100 states, dozens of financial companies, bank managers and more than 1,000 potential investors from the wide world and from Arab states arrived at the Sharm el-Sheikh conference over the weekend.

News article:
Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir said today that he intended to take an active part in the autonomy negotiations with Egypt and the U.S. He also said that May 26 is not the final date for completion of the talks but merely a desired date. Shamir’s remarks echoed those of Premiere Menachem Begin who stressed in a speech in Maalot yesterday that the May 26 target date set in the Camp David accords was not a deadline , Begin noted that it had taken six months rather than the targeted three, to negotiate the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and similarly the autonomy talks could proceed for as long as it takes to reach agreement. These comments by Shamir and Begin appeared intended to prepare the public for the all but certain prospect that the autonomy talks will not be completed by May 26. Reports from Washington indicated that the U.S. also realizes that the chance for a successful conclusion by that date is exceedingly slim. LINOWITZ DUE IN ISRAEL SATURDAY Nevertheless, the U.S., is urging Israel to make the most of the time available until May 26. Special Ambassador Sol Linowitz. due here Saturday, is expected to make that point, It is not known how long Linowitz will remain in Israel or what his precise schedule will be . Interior Minister Yosef Burg, Israel’s chief negotiator in the autonomy talks. told the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Security Committee today that neither Egypt for the US, objected to his proposal to speed up the negotiations, Burg suggested over the weekend that the top level autonomy team meet on a weekly basis instead of about once a month as has been the case until now. Burg made his proposal in response to Egyptian charges that Israel was responsible for the slow peace of the autonomy talks. The chief Egyptian negotiator, Prime Minister Mustapha Khalil, was quoted by the Cairo newspaper, AL-Gumhuriya, yesterday as, saying that while Egypt is not opposed to speeding up the negotiating process, “the good intentions are much more important than the frequency and the length of the autonomy sessions.”

News article:
Four days before Israeli elections, regional leaders met with US secretary of state John Kerry in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh to discuss the Palestinian situation and Israeli-Palestinian peace. King Abdullah II of Jordan, Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, and Kerry were all there to attend a major Egyptian investment summit, hosted by Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. On the sidelines of the conference, however, the four men considered how to stabilize the Palestinian economy and plotted moving the peace process forward with the next Israeli government. The electoral victory of Likud, and the continuation of Benjamin Netanyahu’s premiership, puts a damper on any peace plans—especially following the Israeli leader’s campaign promise to block the emergence of a Palestinian state. On numerous occasions, the last Israeli government spoke of its quiet cooperation with Egypt and other Arab states on issues of mutual interest: from countering salafi-jihadism to keeping Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Israeli leaders pointed out that all this was happening despite a stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and contended that such under-the-table relations can thrive without efforts to solve the Palestinian issue. From the Israeli perspective, the Palestinians are simply no longer a regional priority. A recent visit to Cairo suggests Egyptian officials see things differently. Egypt needs Israel’s next government to move forward on the peace process; and President el-Sisi is open to creative ways to achieve the two-state solution. Egyptian-Israeli security cooperation is closer than it has ever been as the two neighbors grapple with threats from jihadis in the Sinai Peninsula and concerns about the Gaza Strip’s Hamas rulers. Mutual interests on their shared border mean little is likely to change in security ties, but no movement on the peace process will increase tensions on diplomatic fronts and widen disagreements even where interests overlap: such as Gaza. Egypt’s rhetorical demands for Palestinian rights build from its historical, ethnic, and religious ties to the Palestinian people and the disputed land — especially Jerusalem. However, as one Egyptian official noted, peace between Israel and the Palestinians is also in Egypt’s self-interest for internal and regional stability. President el-Sisi previously linked the Palestinian conflict to radicalism in the Middle East. The Egyptian official was more direct: Egypt’s enemies, from Iran to extremist groups, use the Palestinian issue to undermine Egypt by attacking its Peace Treaty and security cooperation with Israel. Advertisement Interesting in the current context is that Egypt’s concern about the next Israeli-Palestinian flare-up centers on the Palestinian Authority-controlled West Bank and on Jerusalem: not on Gaza, which borders Egypt The humanitarian situation in Gaza is terrible, but Egyptian officials have limited concern about public backlash for its policies toward the Strip. For the most part, this stems from the negative image Egyptians have of Hamas: an outgrowth of the group’s relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood and the Egyptian government’s insistence on Hamas involvement in attacks in the Sinai Peninsula and Egypt’s mainland. This shows that, as much as Egyptian officials describe the need to consider public opinion in its relations with Israel, public opinion can be shaped by the government and a sympathetic media. If Egypt is serious about needing a peace push, its government has a number of inducements to encourage the next Israeli government to move forward. Advertisement Despite close ties, el-Sisi has not returned Egypt’s ambassador to Tel Aviv. The diplomat was recalled during the 2012 Gaza conflict, and he will continue to work from Cairo until there is progress on the peace process. Because there is value to Israel in the appearance of normal relations with any of its neighbors, the Egyptian government could publicly link its ambassador’s return with the resumption of talks between Israel and the Palestinians. At the conclusion of talks, or to get past major hurdles in the process, Egypt also holds a major trump card: Ouda Tarabin. The Bedouin citizen of Israel is nearing the end of a 15-year Egyptian sentence for spying for Israel — a charge Israel and he deny, and one he never had the opportunity to challenge in court. Israel’s efforts to free its citizens imprisoned and captured abroad are well known; and Tarabin’s release is a major priority for Israel in its bilateral relations with Egypt. Deporting Tarabin could induce difficult concessions from Israel; but his value is time-limited, as he completes his sentence later this year. Despite a number of other priorities and pressing matters, it is clear that el-Sisi is interested in a peace push. In October 2014 remarks to a gathering of Gaza donors, the Egyptian president delivered a message meant for the Israeli people: “It is high time to end conflict without delay and to give others their rights to establish justice so that prosperity and security could be achieved.” The vision put forward by el-Sisi is a settlement based on the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, which is considered a non-starter for many Israelis. El-Sisi speaks of 1967 lines, a shared Jerusalem, and a just settlement to the Palestinian refugee issue. Netanyahu and his prospective coalition partners reject all of the API’s concessions. For Cairo, then, the next Israeli government will not be a “serious partner” in achieving peace. The Egyptian government is likely to focus its efforts on reaching intra-Palestinian reconciliation, strengthening the Palestinian Authority, and keeping the Israeli-Palestinian conflict quiet. From Egypt’s perspective, though, even when the situation is quiet the possibility of an escalation puts it in a delicate position. Above all, Egyptian president el-Sisi wants internal and regional stability. As he sees it, the stability he demands cannot be achieved as long as the Palestinian problem remains.

News article:
Ambassador Abba Eban, addressing the United Nations Security Council today, said that the Israel Government “is prepared to give an assurance that if no hostile act is carried out by Egypt against Israel, then no hostile act of any kind will be carried out by Israel against Egypt.” He spoke at the session called to resume discussion of the Gaza incident and the tension prevailing on the Egyptian-Israel frontier. “Will the Government of Egypt join us in a declaration of fidelity to the provisions of the United Nations Charter calling upon us to settle all disputes by peaceful means and to refrain from threat or use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of any state#” Mr. Eban challenged. “The acceptance of such a code of Egyptian-Israel relationships would not take us beyond our existing commitments under the armistice agreement and the Charter of the United Nations,” he said. “These are all things that we have agreed to do already. But under the burden of belligerent doctrines the pacific obligations which we have undertaken have become lost to sight; and the insidious fallacy of a state of war has spread its contagion both in the theory and the practice of our relationships. If the Government of Egypt, through its delegation, is able at any stage to give affirmative answer to these questions, my government would make wholehearted response.” EGYPTIAN VIOLATIONS OF ARMISTICE CITED BY EBAN AT SECURITY COUNCIL Pointing out that “at no time since the signature of the armistice agreement has the pressure of Egyptian hostility been exerted upon Israel with such provocative intensity as during the past six months, “Ambassador Eban drew the attention of the Security Council to the fact that the tensions of the Egyptian-Israel frontier “are revealed with deep gravity” in the reports presented to the Council by Maj. Gen. E. L. M. Burns, United Nations truce chief. Mr. Eban cited a number of Egyptian violations of the armistice agreement in recent months. “If we were to follow up all such cases,” he said, “the preponderance of Egyptian violations would be greater than the 3 to 1 ratio appearing in Egypt’s disfavor in the Mixed Armistice Commission records over recent months. The Mixed Armistice Commission in the period between August 1, 1954 and March 7, 1955 has found Egypt guilty of violating the armistice on no less than forty occasions.” Ambassador Eban pointed out that according to the official transcript of the meeting of the Special Committee of the Egyptian-Israel Mixed Armistice Commission on the Gaza incident, held on March 11, 1955, the chairman addressed the parties as follows: “I think all of us realize that this did not arise out of a blue sky, and certainly no report or evidence before the Security Council by any responsible party would give that impression. The head of the Israel delegation emphasized that “the report to the Security Council by General Burns conveys the astonishing assertion by Egyptian authorities that ‘persons committing murders and sabotage (in Israel) were being inspired, paid and equipped by political elements in Egypt inimical to the government and desirous of aggravating the border situation.’ Whatever the truth of the explanation, the murders and sabotage thus candidly avowed emanated from Gaza headquarters, for whose activities the Egyptian Government is responsible.” Mr. Eban stressed. CALLS EGYPT’S REQUEST FOR NEGEV AN “INSOLENT TERRITORIAL CLAIM” Ambassador Eban revealed that the Governments of the United States and of the United Kingdom have also “considered the problem serious enough to warrant the use of their good offices within recent months.” He said that the Government of Israel received information from each of those two governments, as well as from the Government of Turkey, during the period between October 1954 and February 1955, concerning the representations which they had made in Cairo in support of the appeals of the Mixed Armistice Commission calling for the cessation of assaults and sabotage against Israel from the Gaza strip.” Quoting a number of threats against Israel voiced by Egyptian leaders, Ambassador Eban referred to the “insolent territorial claim” to the Negev put forward this week by Major Salah Salem, Egyptian Minister for National Guidance, who thereby “revealed the underlying purpose of Egyptian harassment in the Negev. The object is to impede the development of the Negev in order to bring about its annexation to Egypt.” “Is there a single precedent in contemporary international life for a state openly to assert a claim to half the territory of its smaller neighbor, to launch dozens of assaults upon it against severe international condemnation, and, on the first occasion when it provokes resistance, to run for protection to the very Security Council whose authority it had repudiated a few weeks before#” Mr. Eban asked. Concluding, Ambassador Eban said: “My delegation feels justified in seeking a condemnation by the Security Council of the Egyptian incursions, murders, demolitions and sabotage activities described in Ceneral Burns’ report as ‘a main cause of present tension’ and in the Mixed Armistice Commission resolutions as ‘repeated aggressive acts by Egypt against Israel.’ “We seek confirmation of the Security Council’s view that the claim or practice of active belligerency by land and sea is inconsistent with the Armistice Agreement and the Charter of the United Nations. We urge a reassertion by the parties of their obligations to each other in terms of non-belligerency, pacific settlement and respect for political independence and territorial integrity; and we await the Egyptian reply to this proposal. “We advocate, after six years of armistice, a serious effort to make a transition towards permanent peace. To any attempt at stabilization and pacification our government will lend its full support.” Before the Council adjourned without setting the date of its next meeting, Egypt’s Omar Loutfi answered Ambassador Eban, but instead of referring to the Israel delegate’s peace challenge accused Israel again of “flagrant, brutal” aggression. Then Dr. Loutfi made what seemed to many observers here a tactical error by shifting his attack to Gen. Burns, alleging that Gen. Burns in his report went “far beyond the framework of urgent considerations concerning the aggression against Gaza.” Both Dr. Loutfi and Mr. Eban addressed a number of questions to Gen. Burns in an effort to strengthen their cases. The Israel delegate elicited the information that Egypt has been gravely condemned by the Mixed Armistice Commission at least twice since the Gaza incident.

News article:
Israel expressed confidence Sunday that the Egyptian government will do everything possible to find and punish the terrorists who fatally shot an Israeli woman and wounded three other Israelis in a car ambush outside the Cairo International Trade Fair last Wednesday night. The victims were Israeli Embassy staff members in Cairo. A statement issued by Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir after Sunday’s Cabinet meeting said he was satisfied with the way the Egyptian authorities are handling the case and the wide coverage it has gotten in the Egyptian media. Israel’s Minister of Tourism, Avraham Sharir, who was on an official visit to Cairo when the attack occurred, returned home Thursday night with a personal message from President Hosni Mubarak pledging to press the investigation into the attack and track down the assailants. The plane that flew Sharir from Cairo also carried the body of Etti Tal-Or, 24, who was killed by the ambushers. She was the wife of an Embassy official. She was buried Friday at a cemetery in Beersheba, her home city, where Shamir delivered a eulogy. Her three companions who were flown to Israel immediately after the attack were reported in stable condition after surgery at Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer. Vascular surgery was performed on Savid Zruya, who was struck by bullets in his chest and left thigh. Esther Yefet, 26, was hit in her jaw, left shoulder and wrist. Uri Ziv, 31, suffered wounds in both hands. Both underwent lengthy surgery. 40,000 CAIRENES VISITED ISRAELI PAVILION The four young Israelis had been staffing the Israel pavilion at the Trade Fair. The pavilion manager, Yossi Peri, reported that in the two weeks it was open prior to the attack, the Israeli exhibits were visited by about 40,000 Cairenes who eagerly picked up pamphlets and brochures promoting Israeli industrial and agricultural technology. Peri said that millions of dollars worth of orders were placed with Israeli firms during the fair. The attack Wednesday night was the third on Israeli Embassy personnel in the Egyptian capital and the second to cause fatalities. Last August, Albert Atrakchi, an administrative attache, was killed in his car in the Maadi quarter of Cairo. In June, 1984, another Embassy official, Zvi kedar, was wounded by gunmen but survived. A group calling itself “Egypt’s Revolution” claimed credit for those shootings and for Wednesday night’s ambush killing. There have also been at least two sabotage attempts, one against the Embassy in Cairo and the other aimed at the Israel Consulate in Alexandria.

Israel expressed confidence Sunday that the Egyptian government will do everything possible to find and punish the terrorists who fatally shot an Israeli woman and wounded three other Israelis in a car ambush outside the Cairo International Trade Fair last Wednesday night. The victims were Israeli Embassy staff members in Cairo. A statement issued by Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir after Sunday’s Cabinet meeting said he was satisfied with the way the Egyptian authorities are handling the case and the wide coverage it has gotten in the Egyptian media.

News article:
Premier Yitzhak Shamir sent a message of warm greetings today to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt to mark the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Israel-Egypt peace treaty. Shamir expressed his hope for “development” of the relations between the two countries and also expressed his confidence that the treaty would be a “cornerstone” for broader Middle East peace. Shamir’s aides said his message was especially significant because it follows some harsh statements by the Premier accusing Egypt of failure to abide by the spirit of the peace treaty in its cool relations with Israel. Meanwhile, Abba Eban, the Labor Party’s foreign affairs spokesman, is scheduled to visit Egypt next week at the invitation of top government figures there. Eban expects to meet with Mubarak. This would be a relatively rare dialogue between a leading Israeli personality (albeit from the opposition) and the Egyptian leader. Just back from Egypt on a private business visit, Haim Zadok, a Justice minister in the former Labor government, told reporters that the Egyptians are presently occupied with their own elections to be held in May. But, he said, they are clearly interested in promoting ties with Israel’s Labor movement. Zadok met with former Premier Mustafa Khalil and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Butros Ghali.

News article:
Ten years after Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty, one of its architects, Menachem Begin, expressed disappointed at the incomplete manner in which relations between the two countries have developed. Begin, in a radio interview unusual for the reclusive former premier, said there is no cause for real celebration now, despite the exchange of ambassadors and the air and road links between the former enemies. Begin rejected Egyptian assertions that Israel has not fully implemented the Camp David accords and made no progress in helping to resolve the Palestinian issue. But Eliahu Ben-Elissar, Israel’s first ambassador to Egypt and now a Likud member of the Knesset, said the peace treaty has gone beyond his expectations. He said relations between the two nations are better today than he anticipated when he first took up his post in Cairo. Then, said Ben-Elissar, he had been concerned that Egypt would not live up to its promise of no more war with Israel. The 10th anniversary of the signing of the Camp David accords Sunday was celebrated on Israeli radio and television by almost all-day coverage. Israeli newspapers published special supplements to mark the date. Israel Radio broadcast interviews with leading Egyptians from a studio in Egypt Radio headquarters that were made available by Egyptian broadcasting authorities. HUGE GAP IN TOURISM But pointing out the discrepancies in relations between the two countries, the Central Bureau of Statistics on Sunday published tourism figures showing that the number of Israelis traveling to Egypt, including Sinai, outnumbered Egyptians visiting Israel by 343,000 to 40,000. This strengthens Israeli contentions that the two nations have failed to achieve “full normalization.” In a recent New York Times account, it was pointed out, moreover, that Israeli-bound flights leaving Cairo airport are not listed by their destinations on the departure board, and the Israeli Embassy is not listed in the most recent telephone book. Egyptian authorities told a reporter he could write about an agricultural project provided he would not mention Israeli agricultural advisers there, the Times said. Boutros Ghali, Egypt’s foreign minister, calling the Egypt-Israel peace “cold,” told the Times, “We are still at the stage of peacekeeping, not at the stage of peace-building.” One of the treaty’s other architects, former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, cannot comment on the status. He was killed by Moslem extremists two years after signing the treaty. And the American conciliator, former President Jimmy Carter, told The New York Times, “I don’t think we took advantage of any opportunities in the last eight years.”

News article:
Foreign Ministry officials said today that the forthcoming visit to Israel of Joseph Sisco, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, and his visit to Cairo and other Arab capitals, is welcomed by Israel. No American diplomat of Mr. Sisco’s rank has visited Egypt since Cairo severed diplomatic relations with the U.S. during the June, 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Officials here said Mr. Sisco’s visit would enable him to see and compare the stands of Israel and Egypt on Middle East peace and make it clear to him that Israel wants peace while the Arabs do not. Foreign Minister Abba Eban informed the Cabinet today of Mr. Sisco’s impending visit. Foreign Ministry officials said they have not yet been informed of the exact date of Mr. Sisco’s arrival, accompanied by his assistant, Alfred Atherton. Consequently no schedule has been prepared. They said Israel was informed by the U.S. that Mr. Sisco’s visit was an “orientation tour” of the Middle East in connection with meetings to take place later at Teheran, Iran. He will stop over at London and Paris on his way to the Mideast. The U.S. State Department disclosed in Washington last week that Mr. Sisco was going to Teheran for routine consultations with the chief of the U.S. Mission in the Mideast. Department spokesman Robert J. McCloskey said at the time that while there were no definite plans to visit other countries in the region a stop-over in Egypt was emphatically ruled out. (Diplomatic sources in Cairo said over the week-end that Mr. Sisco was due there next Friday for talks with Foreign Minister Mahmoud Riad and possibly with President Gamal Abdel Nasser. He is also scheduled to visit Amman and Beirut. According to Washington sources, a Sisco meeting with Egyptian leaders would represent a new departure for the Nixon Administration since the U.S. has no diplomatic relations with Cairo.) Mr. Sisco, a career diplomat, visited Israel in the summer of 1968 when he accompanied George Ball, then U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations in the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. In the last few weeks Mr. Sisco has had several meetings with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly E. Dobrynin in what some Washington observers have termed the renewal of bilateral talks but which others have viewed as preparatory talks for the resumption of bilateral negotiations.

News article:
Israel has imposed a trade blockage on the Palestinians since 2007 A $5billion island could be constructed by Israel to connect Gaza with the rest of the world. The Israeli government's security cabinet is debating the proposal which is backed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The island would be linked to Gaza by a three mile bridge and could provide an airport and sea port. The island could cost up to $5billion to construct and would connect Gaza with the rest of the world From left finance minister Yair Lapid, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and transportation minister Yisrael Katz during a press conference in 2013 Yisrael Katz, a top deputy of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel had no objection to easing the Gaza blockade as long as its security needs are met. Israel would supervise security checks but the island would otherwise be run by Palestinians and the international community. 'I do not think it is right to lock up two million people without any connection to the world,' he said. 'Israel has no interest to make life harder for the population there. But because of security concerns we can't build an airport or seaport in Gaza.' Israel destroyed Gaza's original airport during the second Palestinian uprising and its small seaport is not large enough to handle container ships. The country and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza after Hamas seized power in 2007. The blockade is still in place because it prevents arms from reaching the Islamic militant group, which has fought three wars against Israel since the takeover. Critics say the closure amounts to collective punishment of Gaza's 1.8 million residents. Israel currently allows about 800 truckloads of goods into Gaza each day through a land crossing, but aid groups and U.N. officials say it's not enough to meet its people's needs. Katz said the island would be in international waters and could provide economic independence to Palestinians. Palestinians protect themselves from the sun at the current small port in Gaza City The U.S, which also considers Hamas to be a terrorist organisation, has been informed of the proposals. Katz said he is hopeful that Israel's security establishment will back the plan, and that it will soon come up for a vote in the cabinet. After that, international bodies would have to get involved in the implementation and funding. Israel, which will not negotiate directly with Hamas, believes the Western-backed Palestinian Authority would welcome such a plan. Palestinian officials have yet to comment on the plans. Mokhamir Abu Sa'da, a professor at Al-Zahar University in Gaza, told the Washington Post: 'Opening a seaport and airport would help Gaza to end the siege, people could travel, goods could be exported and easily imported from abroad.'

News article:
Gaza's doors are opening to Turkish companies after Turkey and Israel's agreement on the normalization of ties. Out of a total of $5 billion in international funds for Palestinian development, $3.5 billion has been earmarked for Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade for 10 years, and the remaining $1.5 billion has been earmarked for Ramallah. Turkish companies are expected to undertake at least $1 billion worth of projects in Gaza. The contract process for the Erez Industrial Zone in Jenin will start in September. The Turkish business world will take the first step with a strategic invigoration plan for Gaza, which has a population of 2 million living in 360 square kilometers. The Israeli government will allow entrance and exit from the industrial zone to be established near the port in Jenin where Israeli, Palestinian and Turkish investors will operate and provide jobs for 10,000 people. Turkey will provide occupational training for Palestinians while Israel will provide electricity and water for the industrial zone. First step for Gaza With the normalization of ties, strained after the Mavi Marmara raid, the two countries have turned a new page both in economic relations and regarding Gaza. Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci said bilateral economic and commercial relations will continue to gain strength, adding: "We see no harm in bringing Turkey's interest to the maximum level in commercial and military relations. Palestine's interests are Turkey's interests. It is pleasing that bilateral relations will gain strength." As part of the talks, Turkey will first send humanitarian aid ships to Gaza before Eid al-Fitr. This will be the first time Israel will have let through civilian materials, including humanitarian aid to Gaza, after the offensive on Gaza in 2014. Three important steps to be taken The process of normalization of bilateral relations will be seen from airports to Ramallah, visits to Gaza and in investments. Turkish firms will be prioritized in Gaza's reconstruction, particularly regarding infrastructure, and the embargo will be eased, especially for Turkish firms. Industrial zone operations in Palestine will escalate. About 10,000 people will be employed in the industrial zone in Jenin constructed by Turkish Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges (TOBB). The establishment of the Jenin industrial zone was calculated in recent months, and its master plan was prepared. While the final approval phase for the industrial zone is approaching, the contracting process will start in September. The Israeli government will facilitate the entrance and exit of goods in the Jenin industrial zone next to the port. Israeli, Palestinian and Turkish investors will operate in this region. While Turkey will share its experience in developing industrial zones, young Palestinians will be able to take vocational courses. Israel to provide power, water Israel will meet the region's power and water requirements. An area of 950,000 square meters will be surrounded with fences and administration buildings will be built. After the completion of the construction plans, the administration will set off on an international promotion tour. While an international fund of $3.5 billion was set aside for Gaza, Turkey has prepared its project portfolio eyeing Gaza's revival. Israel will provide steel and cement required for urban transformation operations. Turkey will apply for the construction of the Gaza Port. Regarding the agreement signed between Turkey and Israel, Foreign Economic Relations Board Chairman Ömer Cihad Vardan said the deal will positively contribute to the trade and investment relations between the two countries, as well as supporting the political and economic future of their region. Speaking on behalf of Turkish business communities, Vardan noted that the deal will create new opportunities to ensure the security of energy supply and diversify energy source in the region, adding that new business cooperation will be formed, particularly in the fields of energy, construction, infrastructure and tourism. shortlink copied KEYWORDS business

News article:
In March 2013, Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu called then Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to apologize for the Mavi Marmara raid. This was the first time Israel apologized to a foreign state in its history. With this agreement, Israel agreed on Turkey's second stipulation. Accordingly, it will pay compensation to the families of the victims of the Mavi Marmara raid. The third condition is that Israel eliminates the blockade on Gaza. Turkey succeeded to a large extent in this. According to media reports, as part of the agreement, "Turkey will take materials with civilian purposes, including humanitarian aid, to Gaza and make infrastructure investments there. It will construct houses for Gazan people and put the 200-bed Turkey-Palestine Friendship Hospital into service soon." Moreover, Turkey will build a power plant to meet Gaza's energy requirements. It will also establish a water treatment plant to purify seawater with the objective of resolving the drinking water problem there. Currently, the amount of electricity and water to be provided to Gaza will increase. Additionally, an industrial zone in Jenin and similar comprehensive projects in the West Bank will be realized. As the terms of the agreement offend Israel, which has never reconciled with any country or apologized to any country so far, Zionist media outlets either publish headlines, saying Israel is surrendering, or news reports that insult Turkey in order to relieve the Israeli public. Refuting these reports, it was announced that any article that would restrict the activities of Hamas's authorities in Turkey was not cited in the agreement text. Dr. Mahmoud Zahar, a Hamas leader, in an interview one-and-half years ago said: "Things seem worse than before. It seems the U.N. turns a hand to the matter, but we know that they are in cooperation with Israel. Their projects mostly aim to pressure us. They have not made the slightest contribution. They have not realized any construction or repair work. Construction materials are not let through. Tents they distributed drift in the rain. The U.N. does not do anything in Gaza now. Gaza is completely destroyed. Financial difficulties are at the highest level." The situation in Gaza is no different at the moment. Following Erdoğan's "one minute" response to then Israeli President Shimon Peres and the Mavi Marmara raid, not only were relations between Turkey and Israel broken, but all channels of supporting Gaza were also closed. Support initiatives and projects for Palestine, especially for Gaza, are at the core of the agreement. This is why Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri three days ago said: "We are proud of Turkey's stance on Palestine." Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Khaled Mashal congratulated Turkey's insistence on the removal of the blockade on Gaza and Hamas issued an official statement thanking Turkey for protecting the Gazan public. Although only a few leaders from Turkey and the Arab world have embraced Palestine as much as Erdoğan since Sultan Abdülhamid II, some want to hold Erdoğan responsible for the century-old Palestine cause. Those who have questions about the present agreement must listen to the Gazan people and their legitimate representatives. About the author Hilal Kaplan is a journalist and columnist. Kaplan is also board member of TRT, the national public broadcaster of Turkey. shortlink copied

Turkey's humanitarian aid ship carrying 11,000 tons of relief supplies to the Gaza Strip is ready to sail from the country's southern port of Mersin on Friday. The move by the Panama-flagged ship named "Lady Leyla," which has been loaded with relief supplies including rice, flour, and toys since Wednesday, comes in the wake of a reconciliation deal reached between Turkey and Israel after a six-year hiatus. Lady Leyla will also carry 10,000 toys and 10,000 packages of food and aid to children in Gaza via the Israeli port of Ashdod, which it is expected to reach within 30 hours. Five tons of flour and 2,000 tons of rice aid from the Turkish Grain Board, as well as sugar aid from the Turkish Red Crescent, will be delivered. A farewell ceremony will be held at 15:30 p.m. local time on Friday with the participation of Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Veysi Kaynak, Development Minister Lutfi Elvan and Palestinian Ambassador to Ankara, Faed Mustafa, before the ship departs for the port of Ashdod. Turkey and Israel reached an initial reconciliation agreement late Sunday. Diplomatic ties between the two countries were suspended after Israeli troops stormed a Gaza-bound aid ship called Mavi Marmara in international waters in 2010, killing 10 Turkish activists. The Mavi Marmara aid ship was among six civilian vessels trying to break Israel's blockade of Gaza when Israeli commandos boarded it. In the aftermath of the attack, Turkey demanded a formal apology from Israel, compensation for the families of those killed, and the lifting of Israel's Gaza blockade. In 2013, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced regret for the attack. On Monday, months of talks between the two countries finally bore fruit, with Turkey announcing that a deal would be signed, normalizing relations with Israel. Under the deal, in addition to agreeing to Turkey's humanitarian presence in Gaza, Israel will pay $20 million in compensation to the families of the Mavi Marmara victims. shortlink copied Last Update: Jul 01, 2016 4:50 pm KEYWORDS homepage

News article:
A Turkish aid ship carrying 11,000 tons of supplies for the Gaza Strip left the southern port of Mersin Friday afternoon, Anadolu reported. The Lady Leyla sailed south for the Israeli port of Ashdod carrying 2,000 tons of rice, 5,000 tons of flour, 3,000 tons of sugar, 500 tons of cooking oil, and 10,000 food packages in addition to 100,000 pieces of clothing, 20,000 shoes, and 10,000 toys from the Turkish Grain Board and the Turkish Red Crescent (Kizilay). The Panamanian-flagged vessel is expected to dock within 30 hours. The humanitarian mission departed Turkey following this week’s reconciliation deal between Ankara and Tel Aviv to end a six-year freeze in relations. “The supplies aboard this ship are a sort of present from the Turkish people to their brothers and sisters in Gaza ahead of the upcoming Eid al-Fitr,” Development Minister Lutfi Elvan said at a ceremony in Mersin to mark the ship’s departure. “They are a present from our children to Gazan children.” Eid al-Fitr is the festival marking the end of Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. Elvan thanked Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan for leading the process which led to the restoration of ties between Turkey and Israel, and subsequently the aid being sent today. He also extended his thanks to the Turkish aid agency AFAD, the Turkish Red Crescent, and the Foreign Ministry for their help and coordination. Deputy Prime Minister Veysi Kaynak said that Turkey would continue to help the Palestinian people in the areas of education, health, development, and information technology. "God willing, all these projects will be completed at the earliest thanks to the [reconciliation] deal,” Kaynak said, adding that Palestine’s largest hospital – which is being built by The Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA) – would be opening soon. "The end goal is to ensure that the Palestinians live happily and freely in their own country, and enjoy the same rights as everyone else,” he said. Mersin Governor Ozdemir Cakacak said that the aid being sent to the Palestinians was not only a show of support, but an indication that “we are always with them”. “We hope that the pain and tears in Palestine will end soon,” he said. Palestinian Ambassador Faed Mustafa praised Turkey’s continued help and support to the Palestinian cause since the beginning. "Turkey has given us much support during the establishment of the State of Palestine. And later on the Gaza issue. Turkey continues to be our number one supporter,” he said. Diplomatic ties between Turkey and Israel were suspended after Israeli troops stormed a Gaza-bound aid ship, the Mavi Marmara, in international waters in May 2010 and killed 10 Turkish activists.

One week after Israel and Turkey signed a reconciliation agreement , the first Turksih ship carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza arrived at the port of Ashdod on Sunday afternoon. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The ship contained food, medicine and toys which will be transferred into the coastal strip following a security check by Israeli authorities. Aboard the ship was a 22-person crew, journalists, and people from the Red Crescent. All passengers were checked by the Interior Ministry and their entrance into Israel was approved. First humanitarian ship arrives from Turkey to Ashdod (Photo: Avi Rokeach) On Sunday morning dozens demonstrated at the Kerem Shalom crossing against transferring the goods into Gaza and the arrival of the Turkish ship in particular, and attempted to block the passage of trucks and goods. Among the demonstrators was the father of Oron Shaul, whose body was snatched by Hamas during Operation Protective Edge and Illan Sagi, father of Erez Sagi , who was killed during the Gaza incursion in 2014. A police presence accompanied the protest. The parents have vowed to continue to protest and block humanitarian aid shipments into Gaza as long as their son’s body, as well as that of Hadar Goldin, are held in Hamas captivity. Avrah Mangisto , also remains in Hamas’ hands and has been a focul point of the objections to the Israel-Turkey deal. Indeed, the three sets of parents have argued that to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza from Turkey constitutes the forfeiting of IDF soldiers "There is nothing more humanitarian than releasing the captured bodies of our sons in exchange for giving benefits to Gaza. It needs to be two concurrent humanitarian gestures," said Oron Shaul's parents.” "Unilateral steps don't work, and we can not continue to abandon IDF soldiers who have been held in Gaza for two years since Operation Protective Edge," the parents continued. "We aren't against the agreement or aid reaching Gaza, but we believe that this agreement was a chance to release our boys. For this to happen the Israeli government and its leadership must make sure that this condition (the release of the bodies –ed) appears as a central component to the reconciliation agreement."

The first Turkish ship with humanitarian aid for the Gaza Strip arrived in Israel a week after Turkey and Israel reached an agreement normalizing their diplomatic relations that were suspended in 2010 after a deadly IDF raid against the Gaza Freedom Flotilla. The Lady Leyla container vessel, carrying more than 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid for the Gaza Strip, reached the Israeli port of Ashod after departing on Friday from the Turkish city Mersin, Turkey’s Anadolu news agency reported Sunday. It took Lady Leyla 35 hours to reach its destination, the agency added. The delivery, which comes days ahead of the major Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, includes food packages, toys, clothes and shoes to the people in Gaza, according to Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Authority. Diplomatic ties between the two countries suffered a setback after an incident in 2010 when Israeli troops attacked the Gaza-bound Mavi Marmara aid ship in international waters, killing eight Turkish and one Turkish-American activists. The six ships sent by the Free Gaza Movement and the Turkish Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief (İHH) were carrying humanitarian and construction supplies to the blockaded Gaza Strip. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his regret for the attack as long ago as 2013, but it has taken three years to normalize diplomatic relations. The agreement was brokered with the help of the US. Under the deal, Israel will agree to Turkey's humanitarian presence in Gaza, which among other things involves the completion of a hospital in the Palestinian enclave and the construction of a new power station as well as a plant for desalination of water, local media reported. Israel rendered an apology and will also pay $20 million in compensation to a special fund dedicated to the families of the victims killed by the IDF soldiers. Turkey agreed to pass a law that would put an end to lawsuits from the families of the victims killed in the raid. It also demanded that Israel lift the Gaza blockade, but Israel refused to fulfill this condition.

News article:
Turkey has sent food, medicine and clothes to Gaza via the Israeli port of Ashdod, as part of its rapprochement with Israel. The move comes six years after a deadly raid by Israeli commandos on another Turkish aid ship. A Turkish cargo ship carrying more than 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid bound for the Gaza strip has docked at an Israeli port 40 km (25 miles) to the north. Turkey's state-run Anadolu (news) agency said the vessel, Lady Leyla, arrived at the Israeli port in Ashdod on Sunday, 35 hours after leaving the Turkish port city of Mersin. The ship is carrying food, medicine, clothes and toys, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority. "The ship is docking these very moments," a spokesman for the Ashdod Port, Yigal Ben Zikry, said earlier on Sunday. The aid delivery marks a return to normalized relations between Turkey and Israel, which were ruptured in 2010. Back then Israel had imposed an all-out naval blockade of Gaza, but a Turkish aid ship sought to breach the blockade. The results proved deadly as Israeli forces stormed the vessel, killing nine on board. Eight of those killed were Turkish nationals. The ninth victim was an American with Turkish ancestry. The countries severed diplomatic relations after the incident. Turkey and Israel reconcile Containers are unloaded from an aid ship bound for Gaza Image: Reuters/A. Cohen Aid for the 1.9 million Palestinians in the poverty stricken enclave is part of a reconciliation deal signed between Turkey and Israel last week. Months of negotiations between the two sides led to the agreement, which included compensation for the victims of the Israeli raid. Tel Aviv will contribute $20 million (18 million euros) to a victims' fund for those killed in the so-called Mavi Marmara affair - the name of the ship that Israeli forces raided. In return, Ankara will drop criminal charges against the Israeli soldiers involved in the raid. Israel rejected Turkey's main demand - easy access to the Gaza strip - but Israel has agreed to allow aid shipments to Hamas-run Gaza, as long as they first pass through the Ashdod port for inspection. Turkey will also be allowed to build a hospital, power plant and water desalinization plant in Gaza. A small number of Israelis protested the shipments outside the port. They are supporters of two Israeli soldiers who were killed in the 2014 Gaza war. The Islamist Hamas government has kept the soldiers' remains, and the Israelis want them back. They blasted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for going ahead with the reconciliation, and allowing the aid shipments without getting the return of the bodies. Sunday's delivery comes before the start of one of Islam's major holidays - Eid al-Fitr. bik/bk (AP, dpa)

(JTA) — A Turkish ship packed with aid for the Gaza Strip arrived in Israel, the first since Turkey and Israel reached a reconciliation deal that allows such transfers. The cargo ship docking at Ashdod, just north of Gaza, on Sunday afternoon was bearing 10,000 tons of humanitarian equipment and food, Haaretz reported. Israel and Turkey last month agreed to fully reestablish ties ruptured by Israel’s raid on a Turkish-flagged aid flotilla in 2010. Israeli commandos killed 10 Turkish nationals in violent encounters during the raid on the Mavi Marmara, one of the ships attempting to breach a blockade on the strip imposed by Israel after the 2009 Gaza war with Hamas. As part of the deal, Israel is keeping the blockade in place but is easing the transfer of Turkish aid to the strip. Israel also will pay $20 million in compensation to the families of the Turkish nationals. Turkey will press Hamas to return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers slain during wars with Hamas and two Israeli citizens still being held in the strip. The families of the slain soldiers and their supporters protested the arrival of the ship, Haaretz reported.

News article:
Gaza City (Palestinian Territories) (AFP) - Turkish aid arrived in the Gaza Strip on Monday via Israel, after the two countries restored ties frozen over a deadly Israeli raid on a Gaza-bound Turkish ship in 2010. Turkish and Palestinian officials welcomed 10 truckloads of supplies, including food parcels, toys and children's clothing and shoes as they reached the impoverished territory in time for the Muslim Eid celebrations on Wednesday marking the end of Ramadan fasting. "These are the first Turkish aid trucks into Gaza," Mustafa Sarnıc, Turkey's ambassador to the Palestinian Authority, told a press conference near the Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel. "Turkey will continue its efforts to help the residents of the Gaza Strip and to help solve the water and power crisis." The Panama-flagged Lady Leyla container ship docked at southern Israel's Ashdod port on Sunday after sailing from Turkey. Its contents were unloaded, inspected and sent on to the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, hit by three wars with Israel since 2008 and under an Israeli blockade. Youssef Ibrahim, the Hamas deputy minister of social affairs, said the 11,000-tonne shipment would be distributed to those most in need by his ministry along with the Turkish and Palestinian Red Crescent societies. It was due to be the first of many, he added. "These 10 trucks are part of 400 trucks of Turkish aid for Gaza." Turkey had initially pushed for a lifting of Israel's years-long blockade of Gaza as part of the negotiations to normalise ties, but Israel rejected this. A compromise was eventually reached allowing Turkey to send aid through Ashdod rather than directly to the Palestinian enclave. Israel says the blockade is necessary to prevent Islamist movement Hamas from receiving materials that could be used for military purposes. But UN officials have called for it to be lifted, citing deteriorating conditions in the territory. Turkey's ruling Islamic-rooted AKP party has friendly ties with Gaza's Hamas rulers, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause. Story continues Turkey and Israel were formerly close regional allies, but fell out in 2010 when Israeli commandos killed 10 Turkish activists in a raid on a flotilla seeking to run the blockade. Under the reconciliation deal, Israel will pay $20 million in compensation to the families of those killed. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promoted the economic benefits of restoring ties, with talk of building a pipeline to Turkey to export Israeli gas, and the need to find allies in the turbulent Middle East.

News article:
Turkey has sent its first aid shipment to the Gaza Strip in six years after the country struck a reconciliation deal with Israel. The Lady Leyla ship—carrying 11,000 tons of humanitarian aid including food, clothing and toys—docked at the Israeli port of Ashdod, the BBC reported Sunday. The cargo will be unloaded and transported overland to Gaza in time for the Muslim feast of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan on Tuesday. Turkey has not sent an aid ship to Gaza since 2010 followed an incident when Israeli naval forces boarded a Turkish flotilla, killing nine Turkish activists. The incident caused a freeze in diplomatic relations between the two countries, but the pair signed a deal to restore relations on Tuesday. It includes Israel paying $20 million in compensation to Turkish families affected by the flotilla raid and allows Turkey to send aid to and carry out infrastructure projects in Gaza. Turkey and Israel will also appoint ambassadors. Israeli spokesperson Oren Rosenblatt said the ship's arrival was "an immediate implementation of the agreement" and that the Israeli government was making a "special effort" to ensure the aid reaches Gaza in time for Eid. Gaza's 2-million population is mostly Muslim. The Gaza Strip, controlled by Islamist group Hamas, has been under blockade by Israel since 2006 after an Israeli soldier was abducted by Hamas. The blockade has been criticized by the United Nations, with outgoing Secretary General Ban Ki-moon saying Tuesday during a visit to Palestine that it "suffocates its [Gaza's] people, stifles it economy and impedes reconstruction efforts." Israel says the blockade is necessary, however, to prevent Hamas from receiving military materials. Hamas currently uses a network of underground tunnels to smuggle materials into the coastal enclave.

First Trucks of Turkish Aid Arrive in Gaza by Smita Nordwall July 04, 2016 Trucks carrying about 10,000 tons of aid from Turkey have begun arriving in Gaza via Israel, a week after Turkey and Israel mended ties. The first of about 500 trucks carrying toys, diapers, clothes, medicine and food entered Gaza on Monday after a security check in Israel, with more planned in the coming days. Relations between Israel and Turkey broke down in May 2010 after Israeli marines stormed a Turkish ship challenging Israel's naval blockade of the Gaza Strip and killed 10 pro-Palestinian Turkish activists during fighting on board. Kerem Kinik, president of the Turkish Red Crescent Society, traveled to Gaza to supervise the distribution of the goods. He said Turkey would provide "continuous, regular humanitarian assistance" for the territory. The delivery comes in time for Wednesday's Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Israel imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip in 2006 after the Palestinian group Hamas, which runs the territory, abducted an Israeli soldier. The measures were tightened in 2007 after Hamas ousted its rival Fatah and forcibly took control in Gaza after winning elections the year before. Israel says the blockade is necessary to prevent Hamas from receiving materials that could be used for military purposes, but the United Nations has long been critical of it. Last week, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called it "collective punishment for which there must be accountability." NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

Turkey will ready another aid ship to Gaza before the Eid-al-Adha holiday in September, Deputy Prime Minister Veysi Kaynak said on Thursday. Speaking in Turkey's capital Ankara, Kaynak confirmed that another aid ship will be readied before the Eid of Sacrifice. Following a breakthrough restoration of Turkish-Israeli ties, a Turkish aid ship carrying 11,000 tons of supplies for the Gaza Strip arrived at Israel’s Ashdod port on July 3, just before the post-Ramadan Eid al-Fitr holiday. The Panama-flagged Lady Leyla delivered 10,000 toys and 10,000 packages of food and aid for children in Gaza. Kaynak recalled how Turkey and Israel froze their ties in 2010 after Israeli troops stormed the Gaza-bound Mavi Marmara aid ship in international waters, killing 10 Turkish activists. "Israel realized our terms to revive relations between the two countries,” he said. “Israel agreed that Turkey will be the coordinating country in delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza." Kaynak said that distribution of the aid shipment -- food, toys, and packages of aid for children -- began on the first day of the Eid al-Fitr holiday and still continues. He also confirmed that the new shipment will deliver as much aid as the first. Under the deal reached between Turkey and Israel -- in addition to agreeing to Turkey’s humanitarian presence in Gaza -- Israel will pay $20 million in compensation to the families of the Mavi Marmara victims.

He also confirmed that the new shipment will deliver as much aid as the first. Under the deal reached between Turkey and Israel -- in addition to agreeing to Turkey’s humanitarian presence in Gaza -- Israel will pay $20 million in compensation to the families of the Mavi Marmara victims.

News article:
The Palestinian Ministry of Social Affairs on Thursday began the second stage of distributing Turkish humanitarian aid to poor families in the blockaded Gaza Strip. "The aid will be transferred to several Gaza-based NGOs, which will in turn distribute them to more than 30,000 Palestinian families," ministry undersecretary Youssef Ibrahim told Anadolu Agency. The first stage of aid distribution benefited some 11,000 poor families in Gaza, he said, adding that a third stage would be organized in upcoming weeks. Since 2007, the Gaza Strip has groaned under a joint Israeli-Egyptian blockade that has deprived the enclave's roughly 1.9 million inhabitants of basic commodities, including food, fuel and medicine. On July 3, a Turkish aid ship docked in Israel's port of Ashdod carrying 11,000 tons of humanitarian aid destined for Gaza. The influx of Turkish aid to Gaza comes within the context of a deal signed last month between Ankara and Tel Aviv in which the two agreed to restore diplomatic relations following a six-year hiatus. According to Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım, Tel Aviv has met all of Ankara's preconditions for normalizing ties, which were severed in 2010 after Israeli commandos stormed a Turkish aid vessel bound for Gaza. The attack led to the death of nine Turkish activists and left another 30 injured, one of whom succumbed to his injuries nearly four years later. At the time, Turkey had demanded that Israel officially apologize for the attack, compensate the families of those killed, and lift its longstanding blockade of the Gaza Strip. In 2013, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced his regret to Turkey's then-prime minister (now president) Recep Tayyip Erdoğan over the incident. Under the terms of last month's agreement, the two countries will exchange ambassadors and Israel will pay $20 million in compensation to the families of the 2010 flotilla attack victims. Israel has also agreed to Turkey's request to maintain a "humanitarian presence" in the blockaded Gaza Strip.

News article:
Riyadh has cut oil prices to Asia by $1.60 per barrel, the most in 10 months, signaling mounting competition with fellow OPEC member Iran. Saudi Arabia is ramping up exports to regain market share. State-run Saudi Aramco plans to sell Arab Light crude at $1.10 per barrel below the Asian regional benchmark, starting September. Experts had expected a $1 per barrel drop. Prices for Light and Extra Light crude for US clients was cut by 20 cents and 40 cents respectively with the Medium and Heavy grades left unchanged. The company raised prices on all grades except Extra Light to northwest Europe and the Mediterranean. Tehran has boosted crude output 25 percent in 2016 aiming to reach daily production of four million barrels by the end of the year. According to shipping data, the Asian market makes up the largest share of Iranian sales. Since January when international sanctions restricting its exports were lifted, Iran has managed to become OPEC's third-biggest producer. Saudi Arabia has responded by increasing exports of its oil and refined products. “This is a throw down challenge that I’m sure the Iranians will match,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital as quoted by Bloomberg, adding that the market battle between the two rivals was back on in a big way. Demand for crude in Asia is currently slowing with refineries cutting production due to a slump in margins and constantly rising supply from state-owned corporations. Since the start of the year Brent crude rose 17 percent as a result of supply disruptions in Nigeria and Canada. However crude prices have slipped in the last three months and are still 12 percent lower compared to a year ago. Iran predicts balance will be restored to the oil market. “The oil market is oversupplied now but there are expectations that there will be a balance between demand and supply in the market,” said Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh in an interview with Iranian state television on Monday.

News article:
Riyadh said it pumped 10.67 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) in July, its biggest monthly output. Saudi oil production usually peaks in the summer, and it’s a sign it won’t curb output despite plummeting prices and will stay focused on market share. Total OPEC daily production was up 46,000 barrels to 33.11 million bpd. Saudi Arabia’s previous production high was 10.56 million (bpd) in June 2015. “It’s not surprising to see Saudi output at a record. The Saudis didn’t want to cut back on exports and they needed to produce more to meet local summer demand. Also, the Saudis are processing more crude this year at refineries as they want to grow in the products market,” analyst Anas al-Hajji told Bloomberg. And there it is: Saudi Arabia reports July crude output at 10.67m b/d - a new all-time high - in latest #Opec report pic.twitter.com/zNOKb6XzD1 — Nader Itayim (@ncitayim) August 10, 2016 Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries across the globe to burn crude oil for electricity. In the two hottest months of the year, July and August, people in the country turn on air conditioners more often, increasing the demand for crude. Global oil prices declined almost 15 percent in July over concerns oversupply of crude and finished products would delay the rebalancing of the market. However, prices didn’t fall because of Saudi production news, trading flat at $45.19 for Brent and $42.89 for US WTI. “Lower-than-predicted demand, high refined product stocks during the peak summer driving season and rising crude supply … have all significantly exerted pressure over the month,” OPEC said in its monthly report. The cartel expects demand for its oil to average 33.01 million bpd next year, which suggests a daily surplus of 100,000 barrels. OPEC will meet in September at a conference in Algiers to continue talks on stabilizing the market, Qatar Energy Minister Mohammed Al Sada said on Monday. In April, the talks on a production freeze between Russia, OPEC and other oil producers collapsed after Saudi Arabia demanded rival Iran to be part of the deal. Tehran ruled out any production cuts at the time, aiming to produce a pre-sanction level of four million bpd. On Tuesday, Iran said its exports have regained 2.5 million bpd, last seen before sanctions were imposed on Tehran over its nuclear program. The country has not expressed a readiness to talk about an output freeze.

News article:
Tehran, London: Iran says it still hasn’t decided whether it will attend informal Opec (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries) talks in Algiers next month, two weeks after the group announced plans to meet. Iran might delay making a decision until the day before the gathering, a spokesman for the country’s Oil Ministry said, asking not to be identified. Two Opec delegates, who also asked not to be identified discussing a private matter, said Iran has written to fellow members confirming it will participate. The talks, due to take place during an industry conference on September 26 to 28, have fanned speculation the Opec could revive an accord to freeze production with non-members such as Russia. A similar initiative collapsed in April after Saudi Arabia insisted on the participation of Iran, which refused as it was restoring output previously curbed by sanctions. Iran’s position hasn’t changed since the April talks, and while the country supports action to stabilise the market, it won’t participate in a freeze before regaining its pre-sanctions share of Opec output, a delegate for the organisation said last week. Former Opec president Chakib Khelil said earlier this month that Iran’s efforts to ramp up production this year might make it more receptive to an output cap. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh weighed up whether to attend the previous oil-freeze talks in Doha in mid-April, ultimately deciding not to. Opec’s new secretary-general, Mohammad Barkindo, will visit Iran and Qatar early next month, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified. Venezuelan Energy Minister Eulogio Del Pino, who helped organise the failed Doha negotiations, also has been touring oil-producing nations as he seeks an accord to stabilise the market. London: Opec’s secretary-general will visit members Iran and Qatar next month, just weeks before the group holds informal talks in Algeria, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Mohammad Barkindo, who became the organisation’s chief diplomat this month, met earlier this week with Venezuelan Energy Minister Eulogio Del Pino, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the discussions were private. Del Pino, who has pushed the group to take action that would revive crude prices, has been touring oil-producing countries. Barkindo’s visits were earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal. Oil prices have gained 13 per cent in the past two weeks on speculation the group could revive an agreement to freeze production with non-members such as Russia, after a similar initiative collapsed in April. — Bloomberg

News article:
TEHRAN — Iran will take part in an informal meeting of OPEC countries in Algeria next month, state media reported on Thursday. "I will take part in this session," Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh told the ministry's Shana news service. Iran had previously said it had not yet taken a decision on whether to attend the closed-door meeting on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum in Algiers in late September. Oil markets have been carefully tracking reports of whether Iran will attend the meeting, which other OPEC members hope will lead to a freeze in production that would boost oil prices. Iran refused to accept a freeze earlier this year, having just emerged from international sanctions and keen to maximise its oil revenues, but rumours this week that it may have changed its position have led to a 10 per cent spike in prices, according to Bloomberg. Zanganeh did not comment on whether Iran, OPEC's third-biggest producer, would support a cap on production at the September meeting. He did mention that OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo will be visiting Iran "in the near future", according to the Shana agency. Adding to the difficulties of reaching an agreement, tensions have spiked in recent months with Saudi Arabia, the dominant member of OPEC. Iran says it has doubled its exports of oil and gas to 2.7 million barrels per day (bpd) since signing an accord with world powers in July 2015 that removed sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme. Oil production has risen from 2.7 million bpd to 3.85 million bpd in that time, close to the level before international sanctions were imposed in 2012.

Iran refused to accept a freeze earlier this year, having just emerged from international sanctions and keen to maximise its oil revenues, but rumours this week that it may have changed its position have led to a 10 per cent spike in prices, according to Bloomberg. Zanganeh did not comment on whether Iran, OPEC's third-biggest producer, would support a cap on production at the September meeting. He did mention that OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo will be visiting Iran "in the near future", according to the Shana agency. Adding to the difficulties of reaching an agreement, tensions have spiked in recent months with Saudi Arabia, the dominant member of OPEC. Iran says it has doubled its exports of oil and gas to 2.7 million barrels per day (bpd) since signing an accord with world powers in July 2015 that removed sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme. Oil production has risen from 2.7 million bpd to 3.85 million bpd in that time, close to the level before international sanctions were imposed in 2012.

News article:
BAGHDAD: Iraq is willing to play an active role within OPEC to support oil prices but will not sacrifice its goal of expanding market share and will continue to ramp up output, said Oil Minister Jabar Ali Al-Luaibi. Al-Luaibi, on a visit to Basra, renewed calls for local and international oil companies in Iraq to increase production and announced plans to double crude storage capacity at the country’s southern export terminals to 24 million barrels in the “coming years” from 12 million barrels currently. “The ministry has new ambitious plans to develop the oil sector,” he said. “Among them, the most important is to increase crude output to reach a level that suits Iraq’s needs; we don’t want to specify a ceiling for future production like in the past.” Al-Luaibi, who became oil minister this month, said Iraq wants to “strengthen OPEC’s role in achieving a balance in the oil market,” but his comments on continuing to increase output suggested it was not looking to take part in a possible agreement to freeze output. “Iraq is seeking to play an active role in order to support oil prices while preserving a share that is proportionate to its reserves,” Al-Luaibi said. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are due to meet informally in Algeria next month on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum (IEF). Russia is also expected to attend the IEF. Iraq’s production currently stands at around 4.6 to 4.7 million barrels per day for the whole country, including the self-rule Kurdish region in northern Iraq, Al-Luaibi said. Iraq’s Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi on Tuesday said the country has not yet reached its full oil market share, suggesting his government is not willing to restrain crude output. Iraq depends on oil sales for 95 percent of its public spending. Its economy is reeling under the double impact of low oil prices and the rising cost of the war on Daesh militants. The government has invited international oil companies to express interest in the country’s plan to expand four of its refineries, oil ministry spokesman Asim Jihad said separately. The government would consider investment offers on a build-own-operate or build-operate-transfer basis for the refineries, which are located in Kirkuk, in northern Iraq, and the southern regions of Samawa, Kut and Basra, the spokesman said. Sources in OPEC and the oil industry this week told Reuters that Iran was sending positive signals that it may support joint action to prop up the oil market. Tehran refused to join an attempt in April to freeze output at January levels, scuppering those talks.

News article:
New York: It’s almost time to short this year’s crude rally, according to the new chief executive officer of Phibro LLC, the century-old commodities firm that was once the largest independent oil refiner in the US. Simon Greenshields, who became Phibro’s CEO in January after his firm bought the merchant trader, recommended shorting benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude at $50 to $55 a barrel. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting next month, probably won’t cut output, and Iran’s production is set to rise, Greenshields said in an interview Wednesday. WTI settled at $47.33 on Thursday. “The fundamentals remain bearish,” he said at Phibro’s headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut. “If we get a rally into the Opec meeting through September, it’s an opportunity to get short. We are in a rangebound market. I’d rather sell rallies than buy dips.” The storied trading house is known for churning out big names in the oil world including Astenbeck Capital Management LLC’s Andy Hall and Glencore founder Marc Rich, so Greenshields’ calls on oil carry some weight. The former co-head of Morgan Stanley’s commodities business has been working since January to revive and regain the clout that Phibro once had in markets as banks back out of the space. “We plan to build out a series of portfolio companies,” he said, in addition to the fertiliser unit announced earlier this year and a newly minted renewable fuel unit. In September, Phibro will start the biofuels business with ex-Trafigura trader Jerome Lunot that will mark the merchant’s re-entry into oil-related markets, Greenshields said. The company, betting on strong demand from low-carbon fuel policies established by states including California and Oregon, will hire four to five people to run the unit out of Switzerland and a couple more in China, he said. It may involve tolling agreements to use refineries or buying assets outright. Phibro is also looking at entering the liquefied petroleum gas market, as well as gasoline blending, storage and logistics, he said. Phibro was founded in 1901 and initially dealt in metals before growing to become, at one point, the world’s largest commodities trading house. The firm cemented its reputation as a heavyweight in oil markets in the 1970s when the Arab oil embargo sent prices surging. New Reality The company wound up in the spotlight during the financial crisis when, as a unit of Citigroup Inc, it awarded then-CEO Hall a $100 million compensation package, igniting controversy over pay at bailed-out banks. Occidental Petroluem Corp bought the trading house in 2009 only to shut it five years later with Hall’s departure. ‘Extreme’ Volatility Greenshields’s purchase of Phibro — which included its brand name, intellectual property, technological platform and customer database — came just as traders were settling into a new reality of oil below $50 a barrel and natural gas near $2 per million British thermal units. Both markets have been plagued by a glut of US shale supplies. “We’ve got extreme levels of volatility across the commodity sector, from oil to metals to gas,” he said. “You’ve got lots of opportunity because the pool of competitors is shrinking. That translates into wider bids and offers.” Greenshields said he sees the surplus of oil persisting through 2017, with US crude stockpiles rising through the end of the year. Gains in production abroad will overwhelm any cutbacks in US shale drilling, he said. “What we know is that the US producers are very responsive to the forward curve for WTI,” he said. “As the price goes up, they will bring more production up.” ‘Rosy’ on Gas Greenshields said he still has a “rosy” long-term outlook for US natural gas because of rising liquefied natural gas exports, shipments to Mexico and strong demand from petrochemical plants. He said he’d recommend buying gas at $2.25 to $2.50 per million British thermal units and shorting it at $3 to $3.50. The power-plant fuel traded at $2.846 on Thursday. Phibro is interested in buying power plants and potentially converting retired coal-fired ones into gas generators, he said. It’s also working on a deal on smaller, modular LNG projects that could make a profit with lower capacity payments of $2.25 to $2.50 needed to gain financing, Greenshields said. That’s 50 cents or more lower than what the larger export terminals coming online in the US require, he said. “The price of LNG in the medium term does not look good: The market is going to remain well-supplied and the new players think they can come in and undercut the incumbents,” Greenshields said. “We think that’s probably true.”

Saudi Arabia and Qatar’s stock markets made a partial recovery from last week’s losses on Sunday. Other Gulf markets dropped in quiet trade and Egypt sank as the government was hit by a corruption scandal in its wheat industry. Saudi Arabia’s index, which had dropped 4.0 percent last week because of concern about the country’s economic slowdown, rose 1.6 percent as many stocks reliant on domestic demand rebounded. Utility Saudi Electricity added 5.3 percent and Al Jazira Bank rose 3.1 percent. The biggest petrochemical company, Saudi Basic Industries, dropped 0.3 percent as it went ex-dividend. Qatar’s index rose 0.6 percent in modest turnover as top lender Qatar National Bank rebounded 1.5 percent. Drilling rig provider Gulf International Services added 0.8 percent after the Qatar exchange said index compiler FTSE had added GIS to the list of companies eligible for its secondary emerging markets index. FTSE’s original list of 20 companies did not include GIS, sending the stock 1.4 percent lower on Thursday. FTSE will publish a confirmed list of stocks to be included in its index after the market closes on Wednesday. Dubai edged 0.1 percent lower although courier firm Aramex climbed 3.9 percent in unusually heavy trade. Abu Dhabi slipped 0.4 percent in a broad-based decline, with eight of the 10 most heavily traded stocks falling. In Egypt, the index fell 1.0 percent to a three-week low after the Minister of Supply Khaled Hanafi resigned amid the highest-profile corruption case since President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi came to power in 2014. A parliamentary fact-finding commission’s report into corruption in Egypt’s wheat industry found the government played a key role in “wasting public funds” in its costly food subsidy program. The controversy could destabilize the cabinet or distract its attention from economic reforms needed to secure a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. It could also complicate an international bond issue which the country plans in late September or early October. Asharq Al-Awsat English Asharq Al-Awsat is the world’s premier pan-Arab daily newspaper, printed simultaneously each day on four continents in 14 cities. Launched in London in 1978, Asharq Al-Awsat has established itself as the decisive publication on pan-Arab and international affairs, offering its readers in-depth analysis and exclusive editorials, as well as the most comprehensive coverage of the entire Arab world.

Iran ready to help restore oil market balance after it regains share - official DUBAI, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Iran is ready to support any decision to help restore balance to the oil market after it regains its pre-sanctions market share, the Iranian oil ministry's SHANA news agency reported on Saturday, quoting a minister. Algerian Energy Minister Nouredine Bouterfa said after talks in Tehran with his Iranian counterpart, Bijan Zanganeh, that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) wanted an oil price of between $50-60 a barrel, according to SHANA "Deputy Petroleum Minister in International Affairs and Trading Amir Hossein Zamaninia voiced Iran's support for any decision that would help restore balance in the oil market, saying the country can only be cooperative in this field once it regains its pre-sanctions oil market share," SHANA said. Global oversupply in oil had knocked crude prices down from mid-2014 highs above $100 a barrel to a 12-year lows earlier this year of around $27 a barrel. Brent has since rebounded and was trading at around $49 a barrel last week. Iran, OPEC's third largest producer, has been sending positive signals that it may support joint action to prop up the oil market, potentially aiding efforts to revive a global deal on freezing production levels. Members of OPEC will meet on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum (IEF), which groups producers and consumers, in Algeria on Sept. 26-28. Zanganeh has confirmed that he will attend the Algeria meeting. Zamaninia said OPEC countries need to find a way to revive the quota system. "Naturally, if a country wants to produce at its full capacity, there will not be any balance in the market," Zamaninia said, without naming any country, but in an apparent reference to Saudi Arabia. SHANA said that after the meeting with Zanganeh, Bouterfa told the agency that a crude oil price of $50 per barrel was "unacceptable".

Baku, Azerbaijan, Sept. 5 By Emil Ilgar – Trend: Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser met in Doha with Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and discussed the oil market and other related issues, OPEC's official website reported Sep. 5. The meeting was also attended by Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada, Qatar’s minister of energy and industry and current OPEC conference president. The Qatari prime minister expressed confidence that Barkindo would work closely with OPEC member countries to overcome the current challenges in the interest of all oil producers and consumers. “The Doha initiative in February and April this year has provided both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers with a platform upon which a credible framework can be further developed to restore oil market stability,” Barkindo said. Qatar invited OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers for a meeting that was held in Doha in April this year to discuss oil market developments. OPEC members will meet on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum (IEF), which groups producers and consumers, in Algeria on Sept. 26-28. Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh has earlier confirmed that he will take part in the upcoming meeting, aimed at a "common action" to support the global oil prices. Iran’s oil output stood at 3.9 million barrels per day (mbpd) before sanctions brought it down to 2.8 mbpd. The output now stands at 3.7 mbpd. Saudi Arabia and some other countries used Iran’s partial absence from the market under sanctions to export beyond their OPEC quotas, with a result that the OPEC output for July stood at 33.44 mbpd while the official ceiling is 30.45 mbpd. OPEC’s secretary general is expected to hold on Sept. 5 a tripartite meeting with Al-Sada and Noureddine Boutarfa, Algeria’s minister of energy, who is also currently visiting Qatar, OPEC's website reported. Boutarfa was in Tehran on Sunday. Barkindo was scheduled to later travel from Doha to Tehran to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, the report said.

News article:
ALGIERS — Algeria’s energy minister will meet his Saudi counterpart and OPEC’s secretary-general in Paris on Friday as part of moves towards clinching a global deal on stabilising crude output to support oil prices, an Algerian official and OPEC sources said. Algeria will host the informal meeting with Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih and OPEC’s Mohammed Barkindo, said the Algerian official, who asked not to be identified. A source at the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries confirmed the meeting as part of a push for an output deal, with producers battered by a glut-induced halving of oil prices over the past two years. “There is a strong move towards a deal between OPEC and non-OPEC to at least freeze production,” the source told Reuters. “It seems we are going in this direction. But if we are going to freeze, we have to use secondary sources to gauge production levels. We can’t allow each country to use a different method,” the source said. “Iran must agree to be in line with other producers and use secondary sources.” Tehran says it supports any measures to stabilise the market. However, it has stopped short of indicating whether it would join a global deal before its production reaches 4 million barrels per day (bpd), the level at which it says it was pumping before the imposition of Western sanctions in 2012. The sanctions ended in January this year. Iran has been the main factor preventing an output deal between OPEC and non-OPEC Russia as Tehran has said it should be excluded from any such agreement before its production recovers. The OPEC source said Iran’s production before sanctions had never exceeded 3.75 million bpd according to secondary sources, which include consultants and industry media that estimate output independently. Iran has said it is producing slightly more than 3.8 million bpd. It signalled on Tuesday it was prepared to work with Saudi Arabia and Russia to prop up prices, although Tehran has begun to bargain with OPEC on possible exemptions from any output cap. The OPEC source said major oil producers were trying to convince Tehran to come onboard, adding there was an initial understanding that only Libya could be offered an exemption. “Now there is a push to smooth things out and solve any problem,” the OPEC source said, adding there had been no agreement yet on any level at which to freeze production. “This will be discussed in Algeria,” the source said. Algeria is hosting meetings of the International Energy Forum and OPEC on September 26-28. Energy Minister Noureddine Bouterfa travelled to Moscow on Thursday, following recent trips to Qatar and Iran. OPEC and Russia are expected to revive talks for a global deal on production in Algeria. A similar initiative failed in April after Saudi Arabia insisted Iran join the pact.

News article:
LONDON/MOSCOW: The energy ministers of Saudi Arabia and Algeria will meet with Opec’s top official later on Friday as major oil producers continue to lay the ground for a potential deal to bolster crude prices in Algiers this month. Algerian Energy Minister Noor Al Deen Bouterfa told reporters in Moscow that he will hold talks with his Saudi counterpart Khalid Al Falih and Mohammad Barkindo, secretary-general of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, in Paris Friday afternoon. He declined to comment on the agenda of the meeting. After two years of a Saudi-led strategy of all-out pumping, adopted to protect market share against the surge in US shale oil, crude is still trading at half its 2014 level and major producers are putting cooperation to stabilise the market back on the table. Opec and Russia — which together produce more than half the world’s oil — will hold informal talks in the Algerian capital later this month, raising expectations that a deal to freeze output that failed in April could be revived. For a story on four scenarios for nations attending the Algiers talks, click here. Bouterfa was speaking before a meeting with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak in Moscow. A freeze in production by Opec and Russia would be the most effective way of stabilising the market, Novak said in a joint press conference at the G20 summit in China with his Saudi counterpart on Sept. 5. Novak said his country is ready to cap output at the level of any month in the second half of this year, a period that so far has delivered record volumes from both Russia and Opec. Iraq has already given fellow Opec members the level of crude production at which it would be prepared to freeze output, Falah Al-Amri, the director general of Iraq’s Oil Marketing Co., known as SOMO, said Thursday at a conference in Singapore. It will be too early for Iran to discuss freezing crude output when the world’s biggest producers meet later this month in Algiers, Mohsen Ghamsari, director for international affairs at state-run National Iranian Oil Co., said at the same event. The April talks on freezing production collapsed in acrimony because Saudi Arabia insisted that Iran should join, while the Persian nation said it would keep increasing output after the lifting of international sanctions.

Rouhani: Iran supports any move for oil market, price stability TEHRAN, Sept 18 (Shana) — President Hassan Rouhani says Tehran supports any move for stabilization of the market and improvement of oil prices based on justice, fairness and observation of fair quota for the producing countries.Speaking to Ecuador President Rafael Correa on the sidelines of the NAM Summit in Venezuela on Saturday, Rouhani said the Islamic Republic of Iran welcomes expansion of cooperation with Ecuador in all fields. He said strong bonds between Iran and Ecuador and their common goals along with their abundant commonalty in international and regional issues all necessitate further expansion of bilateral ties. He went on to say that lift of sanctions has provided a suitable opportunity for expansion of bilateral relations. He noted that Iran is fully prepared to provide Ecuador with its potential and experience in the scientific, technological and energy domains. The Iranian president said expansion of banking cooperation between Iran and Ecuador is a must and to give an impetus in bilateral relations, especially in the private sectors, expansion of banking cooperation is highly important. Referring to the upcoming meeting of the OPEC and non-OPEC producers in Algeria, President Rouhani said instability and falling oil prices are harmful to all countries, especially oil producers, and Tehran welcomes any move aimed at market stability and improvement of oil prices based on justice, fairness and fair quota of all the oil producers. Correa said in turn that Ecuador nation and government has always been appreciating the campaigns of Iranian government and nation and always supported them. He said lift of unjust sanctions provides the two countries with an opportunity to upgrade ties and they should benefit from the chance. “Ecuador is determined to expand cooperation with the Islamic Republic of Iran in all domains and to this end, promotion of mutual banking cooperation is essential to proceed with projects and plans.” He referred to the upcoming meeting of the oil producers and consumers in Algeria and said justice in price of oil is essential and all countries should strive for success of the meeting.

News article:
Dubai: The supply glut is just worsening by the day, and even the prices. After vows to stabilise the oil market by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and non-Opec members, now more supplies from Nigeria and Libya are threatening the recent price recovery ahead of the much anticipated oil producers meeting in Algeria next week. Production from Nigeria and Libya hit 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, almost half of 2013 production levels. Any additional supplies is expected to add to the current overhang of supplies, which according to the International Energy Agency will last deep into 2017. Oil prices, which recovered more than 60 per cent after prices hit a 12 years low to sub-$30 per barrel in January, traded at $45 per barrel on Friday. “With these extra barrels potentially hitting the market, the pressure on prices and the need for other producers to cut production may continue to weigh on prices. This at a time of year where crude oil prices from a seasonal perspective tend to trade lower,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank said. Analysts are not sure of a deal even as Iran and Saudi Arabia have been raising exports despite the approaching meeting from September 26 to 28 in Algeria. “I am sceptical not only about the willingness of Saudi, the Opec in general, and Russia to reach an agreement, but also about the capacity of such agreement to impact prices,” Francisco Quintana, Head of Strategy at Foresight Advisors said over email. “I am still comfortable with a 10 per cent range around the $50 benchmark as the final target for the year,” Quintana said. At the G20 meeting in China earlier in the month, Saudi Arabia and Russia vowed to undertake necessary steps to stabilise the oil market, but gave no concrete details. Other countries like the UAE, Kuwait also welcomed and agreed to support any moves. However, about the supply and demand dynamics and recent estimates by IEA and Opec, according to Quintana, “depict a complicated picture, in which supply is resilient or expanding, and demand is weakening in China and India.” “We are only seeing adjustments in over-optimistic demand forecasts that took place over the last years,” Quintana added.

ALGIERS: Opec members could decide to hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss oil prices immediately after an informal gathering in Algiers next week, Algerian Energy Minister Noor Al Deen Bouterfa said on Tuesday. Bouterfa told local radio he was optimistic that participants would reach a consensus on how to stabilise the oil markets at the Algiers meeting of Opec and non-OPEC producers on Sept. 26-28. “Oil ministers may decide to hold an extraordinary meeting immediately,” he said. Algeria has been pushing for oil to be stabilised at around $60 a barrel. Bouterfa has travelled to Qatar, Iran and Russia to lobby for action to steady the market. International benchmark Brent crude oil futures were trading at about $45 per barrel on Tuesday. On a visit to Algiers over the weekend, Mohammed Barkindo, secretary-general of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said an extraordinary meeting could happen if the Algeria conference produced a consensus. He has said the Algiers meeting was for consultations and not decision-making.

Ohio – Hillary Clinton is tweaking rival Donald Trump’s decision to travel to Mexico, saying it takes more to make up for a “year of insults and insinuations” than a quick trip to America’s southern neighbor. Clinton says at the American Legion’s annual convention in Ohio that voters need to know that they can count on you. She says “it certainly takes more than trying to make up for a year of insults and insinuations by dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and then flying home again.” The Democratic presidential nominee adds, “That is not how it works.” Trump was meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto later Wednesday. Trump’s surprise visit was coming hours before a major address on immigration in Arizona. Clinton says the United States in “an exceptional nation” and is accusing rival Donald Trump of thinking that approach is “insulting to the rest of the world.” She says the U.S. is an indispensable nation and has a “unique and unparalleled ability to be a force for peace and progress.” Referencing Trump’s threats to “walk away from our alliances,” she notes that when America fails to lead, the country leaves a vacuum for the rest of the world to fill.

News article:
Tampa, FL – Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of insulting America’s veterans and pressing dangerous military plans around the globe on Tuesday, seeking to undercut his appeal to service families in Southern voting battlegrounds. Trump declared “our country is going to hell” because of policies she would make even worse. Clinton, addressing supporters in Florida, warned that Trump would lead the nation back to war in the Middle East. And to military vets and their families, she pointed anew to his summertime dust-up with the Muslim parents of a slain American soldier. “His whole campaign has been one long insult to all those who have worn the uniform,” the Democratic nominee said at the University of South Florida in Tampa. Republican Trump, trying emphasize his military support, released a letter from 88 retired generals and admirals citing an urgent need for a “course correction” in America’s national security policy. It was aimed at rebutting Clinton’s arguments that she would be best positioned to lead the military and reassuring Republicans who have openly worried that his provocative statements might undermine U.S. alliances. “We believe that such a change can only be made by someone who has not been deeply involved with, and substantially responsible for, the hollowing out of our military and the burgeoning threats facing our country around the world,” the military leaders wrote. “For this reason, we support Donald Trump’s candidacy to be our next commander in chief.” Clinton pushed back, saying Trump has lagged in securing key military supporters compared to past Republican nominees including John McCain and Mitt Romney. She pointed to her endorsements from retired Marine Gen. John Allen, who blasted Trump at the Democratic National Committee, and former CIA deputy director Mike Morell. “They know they can count on me to be the kind of commander in chief who will protect our country and our troops, and they know they cannot count on Donald Trump,” Clinton said en route to Florida. “They view him as a danger and a risk.” The conflicting messages came as the candidates prepared to appear at an MSNBC forum Wednesday night on national security. While they will appear separately and not be on stage at the same time, it could serve as a warm-up to their highly-anticipated first presidential debate on Sep. 26 in New York. Campaigning in Virginia Beach, Virginia, Trump vowed to take aggressive action to help veterans at home and confront threats abroad including acts of terrorism from the Islamic State group. He was questioned by retired Gen. Michael Flynn, the former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency who is a strong supporter. “We are going to solve the ISIS problem,” Trump said. “But we have to get back to building our country, because our country is going to hell.” Trump promised to fix problems at the Veterans Administration, which has grappled with patient care mismanagement during the Obama administration. Until those problems are resolved, he said he would allow veterans to seek treatment at private doctors or hospitals free of charge. “Your government is going to pay your bill,” he pledged. Clinton’s message was amplified by her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, who was telling a North Carolina audience that Trump has misled voters on his views on the Iraq war and intervention in Libya. Excerpts of Kaine’s speech, which was billed by Clinton’s campaign as a major national security address, painted Trump as dishonest, clueless and dangerous when it comes to national security. Kaine was saying Trump tells voters he was opposed to the Iraq War even though he expressed support for it leading up to the U.S. invasion. Meanwhile, Clinton’s campaign released a new television ad entitled, “Sacrifice,” that shows military veterans watching some of the New York businessman’s more provocative statements. The spot includes clips of Trump claiming to know more about the Islamic State group than military generals, and his criticism of McCain, the Republican senator from Arizona and a former prisoner of war. The ad, which features former Georgia Sen. Max Cleland, a triple-amputee who served in Vietnam, also keys on Trump’s assertion that he has sacrificed a lot compared to families who have lost loved ones in conflict. “Our veterans deserve better,” reads a line at the end of the ad, which is airing in Ohio, Florida, Iowa, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Republicans, too, have questioned Trump’s capacity to serve as commander in chief. Dozens of GOP national security leaders released a letter last month warning that he would risk the nation’s “national security and well-being.” Separately, Trump continued to face questions about his immigration policy a day after refusing to rule out a pathway to legal status for immigrants in the country illegally. He focused on his proposed border wall plan in a Tuesday interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Last week in Phoenix, he told a raucous crowd of supporters that there was “one way only” for immigrants here illegally to become legal — to return home and get in line for official readmittance.

News article:
Tampa, FL – Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of insulting America’s veterans and pressing dangerous military plans around the globe on Tuesday, seeking to undercut his appeal to service families in Southern voting battlegrounds. Trump declared “our country is going to hell” because of policies she would make even worse. Clinton, addressing supporters in Florida, warned that Trump would lead the nation back to war in the Middle East. And to military vets and their families, she pointed anew to his summertime dust-up with the Muslim parents of a slain American soldier. “His whole campaign has been one long insult to all those who have worn the uniform,” the Democratic nominee said at the University of South Florida in Tampa.

News article:
Hillary Clinton said in an interview in Israel that the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is praying for Donald Trump to win the presidency. Clinton said terrorists are praying, “Please, Allah, make Trump president of America,” saying ISIS is “rooting for Donald Trump’s victory.” {mosads}”We have made a judgment based on a lot of research that bringing Islam into the definition of our enemy actually serves the purpose of the radical jihadists, and there is a lot of evidence of that,” Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, told Israel’s Channel 2 in an interview broadcast Thursday. She cited an article from Matthew Olsen, the former head of the National Counterterrorism Center and a Clinton backer, saying it showed “ISIS spokespeople rooting for Donald Trump’s victory.” “Basically, Matt Olsen argues that the jihadists see this as a great gift,” Clinton said. “They are saying, ‘Oh, please, Allah, make Trump president of America.’ So, I’m not interested in giving aid and comfort to their evil ambitions. I want to defeat them. I want to end their reign of terror.” Her response came after being asked why she doesn’t call the fight against ISIS a war on “radical Islam.” Trump, the Republican nominee, has long criticized Clinton and the Obama administration for refusing to use the term. Clinton over the summer did refer to “radical Islamism.” The remark is intended to undercut Trump’s standing on terrorism and national security issues as the nominees battle on related topics this week, including at a forum on national security Wednesday night. Clinton’s campaign has used similar arguments in the past, including last year claiming that ISIS was invoking the outspoken businessman to recruit more terrorists. “Trump’s anti-Muslim proposals are likely to inspire and radicalize more violent jihadists in the U.S. and Europe. Specifically, his calls for a ban on Muslims visiting our country and for blanket spying on mosques reinforce ISIS’s view that the U.S. is hostile to all Muslims,” Olsen wrote in his article. “Trump’s statements also serve to isolate and alienate the same Muslim Americans who must be our partners in this fight,” he wrote.

News article:
Baltimore – Donald Trump criticized Hillary Clinton Monday for her characterization that half of his supporters belonged in “a basket of deplorables,” denouncing the comment as “an explicit attack on the American voter” and suggesting that it makes her unfit for the presidency. No stranger to making his own sweeping negative characterizations of large groups of people, Trump nonetheless deployed the remark as the foundation for a new campaign theme. The message: Clinton is divisive, while Trump is the only candidate representing “all Americans.” “You cannot run for president if you have such contempt in your heart for the American voter,” Trump said. “You can’t lead this nation if you have such a low opinion of its citizens.” In a speech to the National Guard Association conference in Baltimore, Trump said Clinton’s comments were aimed at those in uniform, whether in the military or in law enforcement. “These were the people Hillary Clinton so viciously demonized,” said Trump, who demanded that Clinton issue a full apology. “She divides people into baskets as though they were objects not human beings.” Clinton has said she regrets using the term, “half,” to describe the proportion of Trump supporters she considers “deplorables.” But she didn’t back down from describing his campaign as largely built on prejudice and paranoia. The comments, though, combined with Clinton’s health scare Sunday at the 9/11 memorial — she was captured on video struggling to step into a waiting van and her doctor later announced that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia — could reshape the race, in which Clinton holds slim leads in several battleground states. Trump and his allies pounced on Clinton’s “deplorables” remark, but remained mostly disciplined and silent on Clinton’s health. A new ad, set to air in the battleground states of Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, is squarely aimed at the voters the Trump campaign says Clinton is vilifying. “You know what’s deplorable? Hillary Clinton viciously demonizing hard working people like you,” concludes the ad. Clinton, who has said she is the candidate to unify a divided country, made the “deplorables” comment at a fundraiser Friday night in New York. She has made similar comments recently, including on an Israeli television station. “To just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic — you name it,” she said, before stressing that other Trump supporters are frustrated and need sympathy. Trump and his aides have predicted that Clinton’s statement would be more damaging than the gaffe to which it has been frequently compared, when Mitt Romney four years ago suggested that “47 percent” of voters wouldn’t back him because they were dependent on government. “When I saw this in its full form and I saw the anger with which she said it,” Trump told the Fox News Channel early Monday, “I think it’s the single biggest mistake of the political season.” But Trump has also attacked Americans who don’t intend to vote for him. When he trailed Dr. Ben Carson in the polls last December in Iowa, he mocked his opponent’s claim that he had tried to stab a family member only to fail after the blade hit a belt buckle. “How stupid are the people of Iowa?” he asked. “How stupid are the people of the country to believe this crap?” He also criticized voters in Iowa by retweeting a supporter’s jab that the Midwestern state’s number one commodity export — Monsanto’s genetically engineered corn – “creates issues in the brain.” Trump has also suggested that those who vote for Clinton would try to “rig” the election away from his supporters and, in a 2015 interview with Sean Hannity, made comments that appeared to echo Romney’s damaging remarks. “The problem we have right now, we have a society that sits back and says, ‘We don’t have to do anything.’ And eventually, the 50 percent cannot carry, and it’s unfair to ’em, but cannot carry the other 50 percent.” Trump, meanwhile, set aside his recent digs at Clinton’s health and told Fox that he hopes “she gets well and gets back on the trail and we’ll be seeing her at the debate.” In recent weeks, Trump has suggested that Clinton lacked “the stamina” to president and criticized her campaign schedule.

News article:
WASHINGTON, D.C. (JTA) — I support Hillary Clinton for president because I have seen her work up close – as first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state. She has the temperament, experience and judgment to be commander-in-chief and our country’s representative to the world. And I know she has a deep commitment to the State of Israel and a special sensitivity to help Holocaust survivors. During his first term, President Bill Clinton appointed me his special representative for Holocaust issues to provide belated justice for Holocaust victims and their families. With his and Hillary’s strong support, I helped recover $8 billion for slave and forced labor, unpaid insurance policies, Nazi-looted art, and property restitution and compensation. As senator from New York and then as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton continued her intense efforts for Holocaust victims and survivors. In my service as special adviser to the secretary of state on Holocaust issues, she supported me when we advanced a number of new initiatives to help survivors. Having worked across four U.S. administrations, I’ve seen firsthand that every president needs a temperament that can endure great pressure. Hillary Clinton has it. Donald Trump does not. With his dangerous combination of impulsiveness, erratic behavior and emotional outbursts when he is criticized, Trump would be a disaster in the Oval Office. Trump even confuses our allies and foes. He has expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin’s leadership style; he is considering recognizing Russian control of Crimea, which it brutally invaded; and has suggested Russia conduct cyber espionage against his political opponent at a time when the U.S. government is increasingly concerned that Russian intelligence is seeking to interfere in our election. Trump has also upset our NATO allies by putting conditions on our longstanding obligations to come to their defense if they are attacked. It is critical to American global leadership and influence that our allies know they can depend on us to honor our obligations. This was recognized recently by 50 former senior Republican officials who said Trump lacks the “character, values and experience” to be president, and “would put at risk our country’s national security and well-being.” This election is not about partisanship, it’s about our values as a nation. Hillary Clinton believes that at a time of great challenge at home and abroad, our diversity is a great source of our country’s strength. That’s why she says we’re “stronger together.” Trump, on the other hand, seeks to inflame one group against another. Given our own history, American Jews have a special concern with this approach – especially when it comes to his plans to round up and expel over 10 million immigrants and their children. And in a chilling echo of the immigration barriers that Jewish refugees found when they sought safety from Hitler’s clutches in World War II, Trump said he wants to bar all refugees who are Muslim from our shores. One of the greatest contrasts between Trump and Clinton is over Israel and U.S.-Israel relations. The United States is Israel’s only real ally, and having the right person in the Oval Office is crucial to Israel’s security. Trump has made no effort to study and learn from the peace process, and has only the most fleeting relationship with Israeli leadership. He has even said that he was “a neutral guy” when it came to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. At one point, Trump even suggested that Israel should repay the U.S. for the military aid it provided. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has always been among Israel’s strongest supporters. In the wake of the continued knife attacks on innocent Israelis, she publicly demanded that the Palestinian leadership stop inciting their people to violence, publicly condemn terrorism and end the pernicious practice of paying rewards to the families of terrorists. She has strong relationships with leaders like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom she played a major role in negotiating the 2012 Gaza cease-fire, and supported vital U.S. assistance to Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system. Clinton has set out a concrete plan to take the U.S.-Israel relationship to “the next level.” And she called for the expeditious completion of a new 10-year defense memorandum of understanding to ensure that Israel maintains its qualitative defensive advantage; the memorandum was signed last week. Her plan includes a pledge to work shoulder to shoulder with Israel to combat the rising terrorist threat in the region. Clinton has called for tougher sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, to curb its ballistic missile development, and to cut the flow of Iranian funds and arms to Israel’s enemies. She has pledged to take swift action, including militarily if necessary, if Iran attempts to obtain a nuclear weapon. And Hillary will do everything in her power to combat the growing Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions effort to marginalize Israel. Israel will have no better friend in the Oval Office than Hillary Clinton, and I enthusiastically support her. (During the Clinton administration, Stuart E. Eizenstat was the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, undersecretary of commerce and of state, deputy secretary of the Treasury, and special representative of the president on Holocaust issues. During the Carter administration, he was the president’s White House chief domestic policy adviser.)

US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s “alter ego” in so many ways, according to an American political analyst and activist. “In so many ways Donald Trump is Hillary Clinton’s alter ego,” Myles Hoenig, a Green Party candidate for Congress, told Press TV on Tuesday. “Although Hillary may never dare to be so publicly racist, anti-feminist, or Islamophobic, she has done in practice what Trump can only scream about.” “How about a wall that would be so huge that it’ll keep the Mexicans out? In 2006, Senator Clinton voted for the Secure Fence Act. This wasn’t your white picket fence with flower pots. Wasn’t quite neighborly, either,” he stated. “On nuclear weapons, Trump has said he would use them against ISIS [Daesh]. Yet it was Clinton, running for president in 2008 who threatened to ‘obliterate’ Iran if it were to attack Israel. The Republican nominee has spoken quite often showing off his militaristic side. He even went to a military boarding school so knows how to salute,” he pointed out. “Clinton on the other hand has promoted and set policies to engage in wars before diplomacy could even take place. To count the number of military actions she has endorsed and pushed would be too long and detailed. Needless to say, Trump talks, Clinton acts,” the analyst noted. In a Politico podcast interview on Monday, US Green Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein said Trump is a moron who would be neutralized by his own party if elected, but Clinton poses a greater threat to America and the world. “Donald Trump, I think, will have a lot of trouble moving things through Congress,” Stein said. “Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, won’t … Hillary has the potential to do a whole lot more damage, get us into more wars, faster to pass her fracking disastrous climate program, much more easily than Donald Trump could do his,” she explained. 'Clinton is far more dangerous' Hoenig said Stein is right that “Clinton is far more dangerous. We can see both views on environmental destruction, which they both support. Again, with Trump it’s his words, mostly, but with Clinton it’s her actions.” He said Trump “might want to drill the hell out America but she has promoted fracking all over the world, considered one of the most destructive environmental actions one can take- from poisoning ground water to potentially causing earthquakes.” “Stein is also correct in seeing the political ramifications of both candidates if either were to win. Trump is loathed by Democrats but maybe even not so much as his own party. One wonders if there were to be an impeachment against a President Trump that it wouldn’t be initiated by the GOP! He’s a fool and the top leadership knows that. They also know that four years of him would almost guarantee a lifetime of Democrats afterwards,” the activist said. “Clinton on the other hand, much like Obama, would get a Republican agenda through a Congress, whether her party is in a majority or not. The anti-war Obama engaged in more wars of aggression than Bush did, and with Congress’s support,” he noted. “Same goes for his support of bankers over homeowners, police terrorists over average citizens, health insurance industry over patients, etc. Clinton would have a free ride to do all that she has promoted in past positions, regardless of her empty rhetoric on the campaign trail,” the commentator stated. “Jill Stein often says when asked if she could sleep well at night if Trump is elected and her response has always been that she wouldn’t sleep well if either of them are elected. We will never know what each will actually do when elected but with both their track records, it is clear that Hillary Clinton is the greater threat to all,” Hoenig concluded.

News article:
US presidential contenders Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump jabbed at each other over how to fight terror, negotiate with allies and keep the US safe and prosperous as the two contenders locked horns in a debate marked by vociferous — and sometimes boisterous — attacks on each other. Locked in an exceedingly close race, the presidential rivals tangled for 90-minutes over their vastly different visions for the nation’s future and how to engage with the world. Trump repeatedly pushed at Clinton over her record in the Middle East and elsewhere, painting her as a “lying politician,” and accusing her of aiding Iran through the last year’s landmark nuclear deal and helping foster the rise of Islamic State. “You look at the Middle East, it’s a total mess, under your direction, to a large extent,” Trump said. “You’re talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now, it’s in over 30 countries, and you’re going to stop them? I don’t think so.” “Well at least I have a plan to fight ISIS,” Clinton shot back. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don’t think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much,” quipped Trump, insisting both that Clinton lacked a plan, but that by publishing that plan on her website “you’re telling the enemy everything you want to do.” “No wonder you’ve been fighting — no wonder you’ve been fighting ISIS your entire adult life,” he said, though it was not clear what he was referring to. Advertisement Clinton contended that Trump lacks “good judgment or the right temperament” and could take the country to war over small issues, like being mocked on Twitter. “A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes,” she said. Trump replied: “That line’s getting a little bit old.” Still, he avoided a specific declaration on how he would use nuclear weapons if elected president. The Republican nominee said he “would not do first strike” because “once the nuclear alternative happens, it’s over.” That statement suggests he would not authorize a nuclear attack unless the US was struck first. But in the same answer Trump said he “can’t take anything off the table.” He mentioned adversary nations such as North Korea and Iran in his answer. Advertisement While Israel was not mentioned in the debate, Trump name-checked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who met both candidates separately on Sunday, saying he was “not a happy camper” over the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump called “one of the worst deals in history.” “You started the Iran deal, that’s another beauty, they were about to fall” because of sanctions, Trump said. “They were choking on the sanctions and now they’re probably going to be a major power.” Clinton responded that Iran was only “weeks away” from a nuclear bomb when she became secretary of state — and said the Obama administration thwarted that progress with the deal, which exchanged sanction relief for limits on Iran’s uranium enrichment and other nuclear activities. “It’s been very successful in giving us access to facilities we’ve never been to before,” she said. She added that the deal freed the United States to deal with other Iranian acts, including the Islamic Republic’s backing of terrorism and record of interfering in other countries. “Personally, I would rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program,” she said. The televised face-off was the most anticipated moment in an election campaign that has been both historic and unpredictable. Both sides expected a record-setting audience for the showdown at Hofstra University in suburban New York, reflecting the intense national interest in the race to become America’s 45th president. The centerpiece of Trump’s case against Clinton was that the former senator and secretary of state is little more than a career politician who has squandered opportunities to address the domestic and international issues she’s now pledging to tackle as president. Advertisement “She’s got experience,” he said, “but it’s bad experience.” Clinton insisted that one key to fighting terrorism in the United States and abroad was working closely with Muslims and Muslim-majority countries, while Trump has “consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home.” “I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policeman of the world, we cannot protect countries all over the world, where they’re not paying us what we need,” Trump said, referring to alliances with US allies to help fight terror. Clinton knocked at Trump for his comments suggesting he would ice-out NATO, and said her plan included an intelligence surge to obtain “every scrap of information” and to “do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.” Yet Trump took credit for NATO’s focus on terrorism. He insisted the alliance’s launch of a new anti-terrorism division earlier this year was “largely because of what I was saying, and my criticism of NATO.” Clinton noted that NATO’s first-ever invocation of Article 5, charging all members to come to the defense of another member under attack, was after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks on American soil. Advertisement Much of the debate focused on domestic issues, as well as personal quibbles between the candidates and their records. Clinton called for lowering taxes for the middle class, while Trump focused more on renegotiating trade deals that he said have caused companies to move jobs out of the US. The Republican candidate backed the controversial “stop-and-frisk policing” tactic as a way to bring down crime, while the Democrat said the policy was unconstitutional and ineffective. The debate was confrontational from the start, with Trump frequently trying to interrupt Clinton and speaking over her answers. Clinton was more measured and restrained, but also needled the sometimes-thin-skinned Trump over his business record and wealth. “There’s something he’s hiding,” she declared, scoffing at his repeated contentions that he won’t release his tax returns because he is being audited. Tax experts have said an audit is no bar to making his records public. She said one reason he has refused is that he may well have paid nothing in federal taxes. He interrupted to say, “That makes me smart.” Trump aggressively tried to turn the transparency questions around on Clinton, saying he would release his tax information when she produces more than 30,000 emails that were deleted from the personal internet server she used as secretary of state. Trump’s criticism of Clinton turned personal in the debate’s closing moments. He said, “She doesn’t have the look, she doesn’t have the stamina” to be president. He’s made similar comments in previous events, sparking outrage from Clinton backers who accused him of leveling a sexist attack on the first woman nominated for president by a major US political party. Clinton leaped at the opportunity to remind voters of Trump’s numerous controversial comments about women, who will be crucial to the outcome of the November election. “This is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,” she said. Both candidates portrayed themselves as best-prepared to lead a nation where many are still struggling to benefit from a slow economic recovery and are increasingly fearful of terror threats at home and abroad. When Trump jabbed Clinton for taking time off the campaign trail to study for the debate, she said, “I prepared to be president, and that’s a good thing.” The candidates sparred over trade, taxes and how to bring good-paying jobs back to the United States. Clinton said her Republican rival was promoting a “Trumped-up” version of trickle-down economics — a philosophy focused on tax cuts for the wealthy. She called for increasing the federal minimum wage, spending more on infrastructure projects and guaranteeing equal pay for women. Trump panned policies that he said have led to American jobs being moved overseas, in part because of international trade agreements that Clinton has supported. He pushed her aggressively on her past support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact while she was serving in the Obama administration. She’s since said she opposes the sweeping deal in its final form. “You called it the gold standard of trade deals,” Trump said. “If you did win, you would approve that.” Disputing his version of events, Clinton said, “I know you live in your own reality.” Trump struggled to answer repeated questions about why he only recently acknowledged that Obama was born in the United States. For years, Trump has been the chief promoter of questions falsely suggesting the president was born outside of America. “He has really started his political activity on this racist lie,” Clinton charged. Trump also repeatedly insisted that he opposed the Iraq War before the 2003 US invasion, despite evidence to the contrary. Trump was asked in September 2002 whether he supported a potential Iraq invasion in an interview with Howard Stern. He responded: “Yeah, I guess so.” Presented with the comment during the debate, Trump responded: “I said very lightly, I don’t know, maybe, who knows.” JTA and AFP contributed to this report

Trump Reacts to #SniffleGate: There Were no Sniffles Donald Trump the morning after the first presidential debate denied he was sniffling, suggesting it could have been his breathing that people heard.

Clinton's best moment, Sen. Tim Kaine told TODAY, was when Trump challenged her on her stamina. Kaine praised the Democratic candidate for her response, which included mentioning the 120 countries she traveled to as secretary of state and the 11-hour hearing on the Benghazi attack that she sat through. "In the split screen I was watching at that moment, she looked like she was ready for another 11 hours, and he looked like he had run out of gas and was leaning against the ropes. That showed kind of a temperament and a preparedness issue that I think really worked to Hillary's advantage," Kaine said. Trump, Kaine added, was "easily rattled" and never answered certain questions, such as ones about his tax returns.

News article:
Donald Trump questioned Hillary Clinton's loyalty to her husband on Saturday night, adding an explosive personal charge against his Democratic opponent to a turbulent week when he repeatedly veered off script. "Hillary Clinton's only loyalty is to her financial contributors and to herself," Trump told thousands gathered in Manheim, Pennsylvania. "I don't think she's even loyal to Bill if you want to know the truth ... Why should she be, right? Why should she be?" The extraordinary personal attack, a reference to former President Bill Clinton's infidelities, came as Trump works to sharpen his focus on the economy – and his Democratic opponent's shortcomings – as he treks across the Midwestern battlegrounds he needs to become the 45th president of the United States. The audience roared with approval when Trump, reading from a teleprompter, lashed out at an economic system he said was rigged against everyday Americans. Friends and foes agree he is at his best in those scripted moments. But Trump's frequent unscripted moments are often drowning them out – diverting attention from his economic message and alienating women and minorities with early voting already underway in some states. He raised questions about Clinton's loyalty to her husband for the first time Saturday night. He also questioned her physical stamina, her mental health and insisted she has contempt for all Americans. "She should be in prison," Trump declared as his supporters chanted: "Lock her up!" Even before Saturday's remarks, the former reality television star this week fueled a self-inflicted political firestorm in a series of interviews and tweets after an underwhelming debate performance by attacking a former Miss Universe, first seizing on her weight and then calling on the world to view her "sex tape." "He's not going to change. This is who he really is," said former Minnesota Congressman Vin Weber, a Republican. "It's ridiculous to even argue this, but if he could stay on message, which is to say if he could be somebody else, he could win." Lifelong Republican loyalists across the country are beyond frustrated that Trump's dueling personas appear to be jeopardizing the GOP's chance to take back the White House. Despite Trump's faults, Clinton remains deeply unpopular and untrusted by a large segment of the electorate. There is little room in the national conversation for Clinton's challenges when Trump tweets about sex tapes and questions his rival's fidelity to her husband, however. Ohio GOP Chairman Matt Borges calls Clinton a "liar" and says she deserves to lose. "And just when it's looking like it's a good bet that she will lose, we're talking about things that I believe don't help us win," he says. There is little sign that Trump's approach will help him expand his support beyond the white working-class voters who cram into his rallies. During Monday's opening debate, the New York billionaire said African-American voters are "living in hell." And his four-day feud with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, a Venezuelan who is now an American citizen, threatens to push his already-low standing among women and Hispanics even lower. The day before his Pennsylvania speech, Trump took another political risk by highlighting Clinton's role in her husband's infidelities. "Hillary was an enabler," Trump told The New York Times on Friday. "And she attacked the women who Bill Clinton mistreated afterward. I think it's a serious problem for them, and it's something that I'm considering talking about more in the near future." That's even as Trump's acknowledged his own marital infidelities, although he tried to draw a distinction with Bill Clinton. "I wasn't president of the United States," he told the Times when asked about his affair with Marla Maples when he was married to Ivana Trump. "I don't talk about it." Trump veered into other areas on Saturday night that may raise questions about his temperament. He questioned the integrity of the nation's voting system, warning supporters to keep a close eye on polling places after they vote next month – especially in "certain areas." "We can't lose an election because of, you know what I'm talking about," he said. "A lot of bad things happen. I don't want to lose for that reason." Trump has repeatedly suggested that only election fraud could stop him from becoming president. There has never been evidence of widespread voting fraud in the United States. He also suggested that organizers conspired against him at Monday night's debate. The Commission of Presidential Debates acknowledged on Friday that there was an issue with Trump's microphone, which was quieter than Clinton's at times. "How many people in this room think maybe that was done on purpose?" Trump asked. In the crowd of thousands, at least one Trump supporter wants him to back off the personal attacks. "He needs to stick more to the relevant issues," said Grace Sauder, a 67-year-old retired nurse from Mountville, Pennsylvania. "It just makes him look and sound immature."

News article:
U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan was booed and heckled by Donald Trump supporters at a party unity rally in his congressional district Saturday, an event that the Republican nominee had originally planned to attend. Ryan announced on Friday that Trump was no longer welcome at the rally after a recording was released featuring the former reality TV star making vulgar comments about women. Trump's running mate Mike Pence was to fill in for Trump, but the Indiana governor canceled hours before the annual "Fall Fest" event began. Defiant Trump supporters voiced their frustration at Ryan and other Republicans who spoke at the county fairgrounds in front of two large American flags, rows of pumpkins and stacks of straw. Ryan — who said Friday he was "sickened" by Trump's words — was heckled with shouts of "Shame on you!" and "You turned your backs on us!" Trump's comments were made in a 2005 video obtained and released Friday by The Washington Post and NBC News. In the video, Trump is heard describing his attempts to have sex with a married woman. He also brags about women letting him kiss and grab them because he is famous. Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel, the only speaker to directly address Trump's crude remarks, was heckled when he said "I know Donald Trump has said some things that are bad." "Get over it!" someone shouted. Ryan obliquely referred to the furor as "a bit of an elephant in the room," at the opening of his 7-minute speech. "It is a troubling situation, and I'm serious, it is," Ryan said. "I put out a statement about this last night. I meant what I said and it's still how I feel. But that is not what we are here to talk about today." Other speakers — including Sen. Ron Johnson and Gov. Scott Walker — didn't mention Trump and instead focused on state contests, such as Johnson's Senate race with Democrat Russ Feingold. But Walker and Johnson both released statements ahead of the event denouncing Trump. Many in the crowd made clear they were standing by the candidate. "Trump is a great man," said Scott Reese, a 40-year-old plumber wearing a red "Make America Great Again" hat. "We all make mistakes." Jean Stanley, a 50-year-old woman from New Berlin, Wisconsin, came to the rally wearing a pink T-shirt with bold, black lettering that said "Wisconsin Women Love Trump." "He's a real human," Stanley said. "It was a long time ago. We all have something in our past. He was a Hollywood icon then." Julie Marso, from Milwaukee, said she still supports Trump. "You should vote according to the issues facing this country, not the kind of dirt you can dig up on people," she said. Orville Seymer, a 62-year-old conservative activist wearing a red, white and blue American flag hat, said the "mildly vulgar comments from 11 years ago" are getting a disproportionate amount of media attention, especially compared to Clinton's "numerous scandals." Stanley called Ryan a "traitor" for denouncing Trump, a sentiment echoed by Dennis Karbowski, a trucker from Elkhorn, Wisconsin. "Mr. Trump is human," Karbowski said. "We've all said those things. ... Either you believe in your party or you don't. I don't like Judases."

News article:
Washington – Donald Trump says he’ll jail opponent Hillary Clinton if he wins the presidency. The Republican presidential nominee made the threat — an unprecedented break with U.S. political decorum — in the middle of the second presidential debate, held Sunday in St. Louis. It came as the Democratic nominee said it is “awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.” Trump blasted back, “Because you’d be in jail.” That drew applause in a town hall-style debate that was supposed to be free of audience participation. A few moments earlier, Trump had said he’d instruct his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor who would investigate the tens of thousands of emails that Clinton deleted when she was secretary of state. After saying people across the country were “furious” with Clinton, Trump said, “So we’re going to get a special prosecutor, and we’re going to look into it.” He added: “It’s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.” Trump’s remarks drew widespread and bipartisan condemnation as un-American. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who served under President Barack Obama, wrote on Twitter: “In the USA we do not threaten to jail political opponents. @realDonaldTrump said he would. He is promising to abuse the power of the office.” Ari Fleischer, White House press secretary under George W. Bush and a supporter of Trump, wrote: “Winning candidates don’t threaten to put opponents in jail. Presidents don’t threaten prosecution of individuals. Trump is wrong on this.” Trump’s “jail” line was one of the most-discussed debate moments on social media during the debate. Trump’s campaign seemed proud of the moment, tweeting a video clip of the exchange shortly afterward with the message, “@HillaryClinton is NOT above the law!” Tens of thousands of his followers retweeted and “liked” the tweet, with some calling it a “mic-drop” moment and the best line of the debate. The FBI and the Justice Department have closed their investigations into Clinton’s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.

News article:
Rolling his eyes at the Republican nominee, U.S. President Barack Obama mocked Donald Trump's purported business acumen and newfound rage against the "global elite," as he rallied Friday for Democrat Hillary Clinton. He warned that democracy itself was at risk if Trump wins. As the presidential election draws to a close, Obama has increasingly embraced his role as troll-in-chief to the former reality star who hopes to succeed him in the Oval Office. With his own popularity having rebounded, Obama has become one of Trump's chief antagonists making the claim that Trump's exaggerated boasts aren't to be believed. He used a rally for Clinton in battleground Ohio to try to debunk Trump's charge a day before that Clinton was at the center of a global conspiracy by wealthy elites and political big-wigs to rig the system against working people. Obama encouraged voters to judge candidates by "what they've been doing their whole lives." "This is a guy who spent all his time hanging around, trying to convince everybody he was a global elite ... and flying around everywhere and all he had time for was celebrities," Obama said. "Suddenly he's going to be the champion of working people?" "Come on, man," Obama said with a sardonic laugh, in what became a recurrent refrain of his campaign speech. In a cutting jab at Trump's business acumen, the president invoked the gambling adage that "the house always wins." "Unless he owns the house," Obama said of Trump, his voice dripping with contempt. "Then it loses a billion dollars." Trump, who formerly had a casino empire in Atlantic City, reported losing more than $900 million in 1995 in tax returns that were recently leaked. He's since acknowledged using those losses and accounting measures to avoid paying federal incomes taxes for years. Obama's final-stretch push for Clinton has coincided with growing concerns among both parties that the intense toxicity of this year's campaign could pose long-term problems for American democracy, as citizens lose faith in the well-being of their political system. In his most direct terms yet, Obama echoed those concerns. "Democracy itself is on the ballot right now," he said. The president pointed to Trump's claims that the election is "rigged" against him, a charge Trump has leveled while encouraging his supporters to monitor for voter fraud he believes will be perpetrated in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. He likened Trump's tactics — including barring journalists he dislikes — to the way undemocratic nations operate, adding that "they are tyrannies and they are oppressive." In a nod to Democratic concerns that Trump is trying to drive down turnout, Obama said Trump wanted to make politics so toxic that voters would figure they have "no good choices, and just not vote." "Don't fall for it," he urged some 2,500 rally-goers in Cleveland. Ohio, with its diverse mix of cities and rural areas, is a coveted prize every four years, seen as a barometer for the shifts in the nation's political climate. This year, it's one of just four states that polls still suggest are toss-ups, along with Nevada, North Carolina and Florida. This week Obama entered the final 100 days of his presidency, and he's increasingly devoting his time to trying to push Clinton over the finish line. Deploying his own popularity against Trump, Obama warned in dire terms that his legacy would falter if the businessman is elected. "I'm here to tell you that all that progress goes out the window if we don't make the right choice right now," Obama said.

News article:
First, here is the problem with Clinton and Bashar Assad. Now she is vehemently anti -Assad, but alas, here is the famous Face the Nation interview from 27 March 2011, when Syria is already burning, in which the then Secretary of State, referred to the dictator as a ''reformist'', who is expected to take the proper action and correct the situation leading to the outburst of protest in his country. A moot point? Not really, because she should have known and understand better at that time. The reference to Bashar Assad as a ''reformist'' belonged already before the beginning of violent protest in Syria to the Hall of Fame of the political absurd. Yes, Left Wingers and Liberals in the West were fascinated by a young fellow speaking good English, believing that this in itself is a certificate of progress, ignoring a political culture of sectarian oppression leading to inevitable economic stagnation . In sum, anything but reforms. Trump of course, did not respond to that, nor did the moderators ask the former Secretary to explain, but the problem emerging is one of conceptual misunderstanding of the future President about what the Middle East in general and a country like Syria in particular, need to happen which will be considered to be a REAL reform. Second, it was the point about the Kurds, who, as she said, should be armed. Yes, they should, and should have been since 2011 when she was in place as Secretary of State. But then, what for? What is the endgame? Is it to use them as the West's mercenaries against ISIS only, or is it to allow them to finally realize a measure of nationhood in North East Syria? If it is the latter, then the Kurds fight and will always for their own homes and survival, if however it is also to achieve the former, then there is the Turkish factor, and the Turkish PM was quick to criticize the former Secretary a few days ago. I, for one, expected her to say something about the fact, that the current Turkish invasion to Syria is NOT against ISIS but against the Kurds, and it has the support of the Obama Administration. So, in fairness to reality, what REALLY does it mean when the next President calls for arming the Kurds? Third, Clinton referred to the negative role of Iran in Syria. With that, we move from the absurd and unreliable elements of the first two points, to the sheer irritation. Yes, this is Iran which is perpetuating the conflict in Syria, yes it is Iran which is engaged in a bloody anti -Sunni war there, but it does it with 150 BN $ US added to their coffers by the nuclear deal which Clinton claims credit for, and with the licence of moderation given to Iran exactly by that agreement. So, where is the real Iran role in all that? Many in Syria and the rest of the Middle East think, that it is in the killing fields of Syria where we see the true face of the Mullahs, not in the conference rooms in Vienna. It was so easy for her to get away with all that in the debate , because Trump, if I understood correctly his gibberish English, is all but ready to succumb Syria to Iran and Russia altogether.

News article:
WASHINGTON — Israel’s Ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer told a campaign aide of Hillary Clinton that the Obama administration was “tone deaf” to the “existential threat” Israel faces from Iran, according to an email from Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta that has been released by WikiLeaks. On July 2, 2015, roughly two weeks before the nuclear accord between Iran and world powers was reached, former US diplomat Stuart Eizenstat sent Clinton’s top foreign policy adviser Jake Sullivan a summation of a recent meeting with Dermer. In that message, Eizenstat relayed that Dermer upbraided President Obama’s team for its failure to appreciate Israeli concerns over the Iranian accord. “The Administration is ‘tone deaf’ about the ‘existential threat’ to Israel from Iran,” he quoted Dermer as saying. The Israeli ambassador also recognized that the former secretary of state would likely need to support the deal in her campaign for the presidency, but went on to issue advice for how she should best handle that support amid her bid for the White House. “It is important that even as Hillary endorses the agreement, and says she would vote for it if she was in the Senate, she ‘should not get too invested in it,'” Dermer said, according to Eizenstat. “She should ‘list the concerns’ she has with it, while saying that ‘it is better than no deal.'” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Much of the further counsel that Dermer reportedly provided was seemingly heeded by the presidential hopeful. Eizenstat told Sullivan that Clinton needed to emphasize that she would, as president: “confront Iran’s challenges in other areas (terrorism, Syria, Iraq)”; “maintain all the non-nuclear sanctions on Iran (human rights, terrorism, etc.)”; “join her support for the nuclear deal with a strong statement that as president she would strengthen all of the US allies in the region, starting with Israel,”; and vow to “redouble efforts to work closely with Israel.” Indeed, in her first speech expressing support for the landmark pact, at the Brookings Institution in September 2015, Clinton promised to “vigorously enforce and strengthen, if necessary, the American sanctions on Iran and its Revolutionary Guard for its sponsorship of terrorism, its ballistic missile program, and other destabilizing activities. Advertisement “I’ll enforce and strengthen, if necessary, our restrictions on sending arms to Iran and from Iran, to bad actors like Syria,” she continued. “And I’ll impose these sanctions on everyone involved in these activities, whether they’re in Iran or overseas.” She also said of Tehran: “They vowed to destroy Israel. And that’s worth saying again, they vowed to destroy Israel. We cannot ever take that lightly, particularly when Iran ships advanced missiles to Hezbollah, and the ayatollah outlines an actual strategy for eliminating Israel or talks about how Israel won’t exist in 25 years.” When introducing her strategy for managing the Iran issue after implementation of the deal, Clinton stressed her objective of fortifying the US-Israel relationship and enhancing the Jewish state’s military capabilities. “First, I will deepen America’s unshakeable commitment to Israel’s security, including our longstanding tradition of guaranteeing Israel’s qualitative military edge,” she said. “I’ll increase support for Israel rocket and missile defenses and for intelligence sharing. I’ll sell Israel the most sophisticated fighter aircraft ever developed, the F-35. We’ll work together to develop and implement better tunnel detection technology to prevent arms smuggling and kidnapping, as well as the strongest possible missile defense system for Northern Israel, which has been subjected to Hezbollah’s attacks for years.” Throughout her campaign Clinton has made similar pledges when prodded to discuss the Middle East, including signaling that she would enforce the Iran deal strenuously and would be willing to exert force if necessary. “If I’m elected the leaders of Iran will have no doubt that if we see any indication that they are violating their commitment not to seek, develop or acquire nuclear weapons, the United States will act to stop it, and that we will do so with force if necessary,” she said to the AIPAC Policy Conference in March. Advertisement WikiLeaks began divulging the Podesta emails last week, and has been releasing a steady stream of messages from the hacked account on an almost daily basis. They mark an unprecedented effort by the group to inject itself into this year’s presidential campaign. US officials have said WikiLeaks is working with Russian operatives to undermine Clinton’s candidacy and boost her opponent Donald Trump. So far the group has unveiled 11,000 hacked emails and purports to release 50,000 more before the November 8 election. The Clinton campaign has neither denied nor confirmed the authenticity of these emails.

On July 2, 2015, roughly two weeks before the nuclear accord between Iran and world powers was reached, former US diplomat Stuart Eizenstat sent Clinton’s top foreign policy adviser Jake Sullivan a summation of a recent meeting with Dermer. In that message, Eizenstat relayed that Dermer upbraided President Obama’s team for its failure to appreciate Israeli concerns over the Iranian accord. “The Administration is ‘tone deaf’ about the ‘existential threat’ to Israel from Iran,” he quoted Dermer as saying. The Israeli ambassador also recognized that the former secretary of state would likely need to support the deal in her campaign for the presidency, but went on to issue advice for how she should best handle that support amid her bid for the White House. “It is important that even as Hillary endorses the agreement, and says she would vote for it if she was in the Senate, she ‘should not get too invested in it,'” Dermer said, according to Eizenstat. “She should ‘list the concerns’ she has with it, while saying that ‘it is better than no deal.'” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Much of the further counsel that Dermer reportedly provided was seemingly heeded by the presidential hopeful. Eizenstat told Sullivan that Clinton needed to emphasize that she would, as president: “confront Iran’s challenges in other areas (terrorism, Syria, Iraq)”; “maintain all the non-nuclear sanctions on Iran (human rights, terrorism, etc.)”; “join her support for the nuclear deal with a strong statement that as president she would strengthen all of the US allies in the region, starting with Israel,”; and vow to “redouble efforts to work closely with Israel.” Indeed, in her first speech expressing support for the landmark pact, at the Brookings Institution in September 2015, Clinton promised to “vigorously enforce and strengthen, if necessary, the American sanctions on Iran and its Revolutionary Guard for its sponsorship of terrorism, its ballistic missile program, and other destabilizing activities. Advertisement “I’ll enforce and strengthen, if necessary, our restrictions on sending arms to Iran and from Iran, to bad actors like Syria,” she continued. “And I’ll impose these sanctions on everyone involved in these activities, whether they’re in Iran or overseas.” She also said of Tehran: “They vowed to destroy Israel. And that’s worth saying again, they vowed to destroy Israel. We cannot ever take that lightly, particularly when Iran ships advanced missiles to Hezbollah, and the ayatollah outlines an actual strategy for eliminating Israel or talks about how Israel won’t exist in 25 years.” When introducing her strategy for managing the Iran issue after implementation of the deal, Clinton stressed her objective of fortifying the US-Israel relationship and enhancing the Jewish state’s military capabilities. “First, I will deepen America’s unshakeable commitment to Israel’s security, including our longstanding tradition of guaranteeing Israel’s qualitative military edge,” she said. “I’ll increase support for Israel rocket and missile defenses and for intelligence sharing. I’ll sell Israel the most sophisticated fighter aircraft ever developed, the F-35. We’ll work together to develop and implement better tunnel detection technology to prevent arms smuggling and kidnapping, as well as the strongest possible missile defense system for Northern Israel, which has been subjected to Hezbollah’s attacks for years.” Throughout her campaign Clinton has made similar pledges when prodded to discuss the Middle East, including signaling that she would enforce the Iran deal strenuously and would be willing to exert force if necessary. “If I’m elected the leaders of Iran will have no doubt that if we see any indication that they are violating their commitment not to seek, develop or acquire nuclear weapons, the United States will act to stop it, and that we will do so with force if necessary,” she said to the AIPAC Policy Conference in March. Advertisement WikiLeaks began divulging the Podesta emails last week, and has been releasing a steady stream of messages from the hacked account on an almost daily basis. They mark an unprecedented effort by the group to inject itself into this year’s presidential campaign. US officials have said WikiLeaks is working with Russian operatives to undermine Clinton’s candidacy and boost her opponent Donald Trump. So far the group has unveiled 11,000 hacked emails and purports to release 50,000 more before the November 8 election. The Clinton campaign has neither denied nor confirmed the authenticity of these emails.

News article:
Private documents released by WikiLeaks show that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton held significantly different private views on Middle East policy than President Barack Obama, Eli Lake of Bloomberg View reported Monday. In the transcript of a speech given to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago in 2013, Clinton rejected the idea that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was in any way an agent of moderate change in Iran. “I believe that Rouhani was allowed to be elected by the two major power sources in Iran, the supreme leader and the clerics and the Revolutionary Guard … in part because the sanctions were having a quite damaging effect on the economy,” her transcript read. “I don’t think anyone should have any illusions as to the motives of the Iranian leadership,” she added. “What they really want to do is get sanction relief and give as little as possible for that sanction relief.” She also dismissed Rouhani’s moderation as a “charm offensive” intended to deceive the West, not to bring about change in Iran. This contrasted with the view that Obama expressed to NPR in April 2015, when he portrayed Rouhani as a change agent: “I think that, if in fact the Rouhani administration — the forces that are more moderating, even if, let’s acknowledge, that they don’t share our values and they still consider us an enemy — if they are shown to have delivered for their people, presumably it strengthens their hand vis-a-vis some of the hardliners inside of Iran.” Leaked e-mails show Clinton to be more attentive to concerns of skeptics of the nuclear deal with Iran. In a December 2015 e-mail exchange between Stuart Eizenstat, a senior State Department official under Bill Clinton, and Jake Sullivan, Hillary Clinton’s chief national security adviser, Eizenstat quoted a senior Israeli official who wrote that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “always had a ‘surprising good relationship’ with Hillary; she is ‘easy to work with,’ and that she is more instinctively sympathetic to Israel than the White House.” In another speech, Clinton criticized the president for his failure to enforce the “red line” he declared when the government of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against civilians in September 2013, killing more than 1,400 people. “You can’t squander your reputation and your leadership capital,” Clinton said at a Goldman Sachs event in October 2013. “You have to do what you say you’re going to do. You have to be smart about executing on your strategies. And you’ve got to be careful not to send the wrong message to others, such as Iran.” The WikiLeaks transcripts comport with other indications Clinton has given about what shape U.S. foreign policy might take under her administration. In a speech at the Brookings Institution in September 2015, Clinton outlined five steps she would take to counter Iran’s growing influence in the Middle East: an “unshakeable commitment to Israel’s military security;” defending the Persian Gulf and assuring Gulf allies that America will act if they are threatened; building coalitions across the Middle East to battle Iran’s proxies and to enforce embargoes of Iranian arms shipments; taking a strong stand against Iran’s humans rights abuses; and adopting a “comprehensive regional strategy that promotes stability and counters extremism.” In the same speech, Clinton said that “not being able to follow through on [the “red line” violation] cost us.” She also pledged to keep disagreements with the Israeli government private, and to invite the Israeli prime minister to Washington during her first month in office, which she reiterated in an op-ed in The Forward.

In the USA the headline from last night’s final presidential debate was Trump’s steadfast refusal to accept the result of the election should he lose. The flagrant disregard for democracy made it perhaps appropriate that this was the debate to really zero in on Middle East policy. During the debate Trump and Hillary clashed on the battle for Mosul, bombing of Aleppo, ISIS and immigration. Trump was taken to task on his mistruths from the last debate, when he controversially claimed that Russia and Assad were fighting ISIS, and had taken the city of Aleppo. Moderator Chris Wallace confronted Trump outright with the inaccuracies: “you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir,” he said. “You said Aleppo had basically fallen… You also said Syria and Russia were fighting ISIS” Trump didn’t only stick to his guns – he even produced more mistruths for the American public and punditry to struggle through. “Aleppo is a disaster, it’s a humanitarian nightmare, but it has fallen, from any standpoint,” he said. “What do you need, a signed document?” He continued to claim the catastrophe in the city was because of Hillary Clinton who, he said, caused the bloodshed by fighting Assad – a man who turned out to be “much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama”. “They are being slaughtered because of bad decisions,” he said. “If she did nothing we’d be in much better shape” *Nobody* could look at this and think it makes sense: Trump's full answer on Syria, Aleppo and Assad #debate https://t.co/9Nyu6MtYYq pic.twitter.com/DCAD6ExbA3 — Claire Phipps (@Claire_Phipps) 20 October 2016 The extent to which the US administration’s contributions have affected the current situation in Aleppo is, of course, debatable. But the government is not fighting Assad outright, and idea that the indiscriminate bombing of the east of the city, carried out by Russia and the regime, is the fault of the American actions is somewhere between a stretch and an absurdity. Confusion about international security aside, Trump’s statement about refugees was deemed not just foolish but deeply dangerous and inhumane. His description of Syrian refugees being “not probably, definitely in many cases ISIS aligned” is false: refugees are carefully vetted and there’s currently no evidence to suggest any in the US are Daesh operatives. Trump says we have "ISIS aligned" syrian refugees in America. (This is a terrible charge to make without evidence, of which he has zero). — Adam Servianski (@AdamSerwer) 20 October 2016 The candidates also discussed Iraq, and the imminent retaking of Mosul. Trump argued that the Obama administration had missed out on the element of surprise in the retaking of the city – and even accused Clinton of timing the Mosul offensive to coincide with the election in order to boost her popularity. In both candidate’s rhetoric, the battle for Mosul was cast as an American operation – repeatedly saying “we” would take the city – although Trump argued that the winner of the advance would be Iran. Clinton’s rhetoric on Syria was much more pro-intervention than Trump. She argued that a no-fly zone “could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict” – although she recognised that there were “legitimate concerns” over just what the tactic might mean. Those worries are a sticking point for many observers, who align Clinton’s “hawkish” attitude with broader tradition of intervention that they believe could prove disastrous for global security.

News article:
Donald Trump wants to keep us in suspense. The Republican nominee’s refusal to say Wednesday evening during the final debate whether he would accept the results of the election is the stuff of breaking news and six-column headlines. “What I’m saying is that I will tell you at the time, I will keep you in suspense,” Trump said. Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival, called his promise “horrifying.” It is unprecedented in U.S. presidential elections for a nominee to not pledge to respect the outcome. What did Trump mean by “suspense”? Who truly knows – his aides were quick to insist that he would indeed respect the results. But whether the next three weeks will be “Suspense! Horrifying! Bad!” in a decline of the republic kind of way or “Suspense! Horrifying! Fun!” in a found footage, “Paranormal Activity: Election Day” kind of way, we’re determined not to keep our readers in suspense about Wednesday night’s Jewish content. Iran, again Clinton has been reticent about making Iran a major issue throughout the campaign: It’s a hard straddle for her between her skepticism of the nuclear deal reached last year and honoring the legacy of President Barack Obama. (Her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., was a prominent backer of the deal, and in a rare tonal differentiation from Clinton, has emphasized the deal as a win.) Yet she was the first to mention Iran in the final debate on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus. It was one of several cudgels she used to depict Trump as beholden to Russia. Her most prominent gambit was in goading him to condemn Russia’s responsibility for the hacks into the private emails of her associates as unprecedented interference in the U.S. election. That led to this notable exchange: Trump: (Putin) has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And I’ll tell you what: We’re in very serious trouble because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads — 1,800, by the way — where they expanded and we didn’t, 1,800 nuclear warheads. And she’s playing chicken. Look, from everything I see, (Putin) has no respect for this person. Clinton: Well, that’s because he’d rather have a puppet as president of the United States. Trump: No puppet. No puppet. You’re the puppet! No, you’re the puppet! Clinton worked in her Iran reference when she circled back to Russia a few questions later, after moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News Channel pressed the Democratic nominee on her plans to defeat the Islamic State, the terrorist group also known as ISIS that controls swathes of land in Syria and Iraq. “I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real — a really successful military operation,” she said, referring to the thrust underway against ISIS in Mosul, the group’s stronghold in Iraq. “But we know we’ve got lots of work to do. Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.” This was a subtle – probably too subtle – reference to Trump’s suggestion in the second debate that the United States may as well concede Syria to Russia and Iran, a prospect that horrifies Israel and the pro-Israel community. (It was Wallace, not Clinton, who later in the debate cornered Trump on his views on Syria, Russia and ISIS.) But Clinton’s reference to Iran, and to Mosul, gave Trump the opening for one of his most cogent and damaging arguments against the Obama administration’s foreign policy, and the opportunity to tie it to a prospective Clinton presidency. The assault on Mosul, Trump argued, may be successful, but ultimately it would be a gift to Iran, which he depicted as the prevailing power in Syria and Iraq. And that’s when he brought in the deal, reviled by Republicans as well as by Israel’s government, which exchanged sanctions relief for Iran to a partial rollback in its nuclear program. Trump: So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing. And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid — the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that’s going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they’ve wanted to do forever, but we’ve made it so easy for them. So we’re now going to take Mosul. And do you know who’s going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Those Jewish names Trump has taken flak from Jewish commentators – most recently Rabbi Jonah Pesner, who heads Reform Judaism’s Religious Action Center – for invoking, in a sinister way, prominent Jewish figures. He was at it again Wednesday and it’s always hard what exactly to make of it. He also cites Jewish names (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his son-in-law Jared Kushner) in a positive way to reinforce his arguments, and the Jewish folks he derides, he has genuine beefs with. On the other hand, Trump seems to subtly emphasize the names – and that coupled with his invocations of grand secret conspiracies is guaranteed to make folks nervous. The first mention Wednesday went to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice who attacked Trump this summer as a “faker” and then apologized. He cited her as the kind of justice he would definitely not appoint. Trump: Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent. And she was forced to apologize. And apologize she did. But these were statements that should never, ever have been made. It’s a legitimate reference, but also emblematic of Trump’s tendency to swerve into personal affronts when he should be dealing with issues. Ginsburg’s attack on him seemed to take precedence, in his mind, over how she and others would rule on abortion and on gun laws. The second Jewish name check was George Soros, the financier who backs an array of liberal causes. It came up when Clinton attacked Trump for not paying his fair share of taxes. Trump: So let me just tell you very quickly, we’re entitled [to tax breaks] because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it. And all of her donors — just about all of them — I know [Warren] Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars … Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do. Refugees Refugees these days are seldom Jewish, but the issue remains a priority of an array of Jewish groups, particularly HIAS, the immigrant activist group. Faulting Obama (and by extension, Clinton) for the carnage in the Syrian city of Aleppo, Trump pivoted to the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States, something Clinton has said she wants to expand. Trump: She’s taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases — not probably, who are definitely in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see — this is going to be the great Trojan horse. And wait until you see what happens in the coming years. Lots of luck, Hillary. Thanks a lot for doing a great job. The “Lots of luck” stirred a social media hornet’s nest – the “tens of thousands” of refugees will arrive only if Clinton is elected. Was Trump, behind in the polls, in a Freudian way, conceding? In any case, here’s how Clinton responded: Clinton: He’s made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in. But I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting. And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. Jewish immigration advocates, led by HIAS, back Clinton’s argument – refugees coming into the United States are vetted, they say, to a fault, with the process lasting up to two years. Most Jewish groups would also be aghast at Trump’s certainty that “in many cases” the refugees are “definitely ISIS-aligned.” For them it smacks of the nativists who in the 1920s and ’30s insisted that Jews fleeing Europe did not have American interests at heart. (On the other hand, hawkish groups believe Syrian immigrants “pose a grave danger to all Americans – and an even greater danger to American Jews,” as the Zionist Organization of America has put it.) Qatar and Saudi Arabia Dinging Clinton’s charitable foundation, Trump brought up donations by Middle Eastern autocrats. Trump: It’s a criminal enterprise. Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries. You talk about women and women’s rights? So these are people that push gays off business — off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money. That’s a bizarre gambit for a developer who has extensive dealings with the same folks.

News article:
Iran’s media say the country has received the first wave of proposals by major international companies to develop oil and gas projects within the new format of oil contracts recently approved by the administration of President Hassan Rouhani. Tasnim News Agency reported that 10 companies have so far submitted their proposals to Iran’s Ministry of Petroleum for the development of 15 projects. They, Tasnim said in its report, include big European names such as Total, Lukoil, Shell, Eni, OMV and Asian giants like CNPC, Sinopec and Pertamina. Several of the key projects that the companies have targeted are the same ones they had been previously involved in or for which they had been negotiating with Iran in the past. The most lucrative project up for the grabs may be South Azadegan for which Total has presented its proposal. South Azadegan was discovered in 2001 in what was described at the time as the world’s biggest oil find in decades. Next in line could be Yadavaran for which both Shell and Sinopec have presented their proposals. Total and Shell had been negotiating with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) in early 2000s over the development of South Azadegan and Yadavaran but their talks did not lead to an agreement. Shell has also bid for the re-development of Soroush oil field – located in the Persian Gulf - which it had previously developed in early 2000s. Total, Eni and Hyundai have presented proposals for unspecified phases of South Pars gas field. Total was already involved in the development of South Pars Phases 2 and 3. Eni was involved in the development of Phases 4 and 5 and Hyundai in Phases 4, 5 and 6. Iran’s new format of oil contracts is replacing buyback deals. Under a buyback deal, the host government agrees to pay the contractor an agreed price for all volumes of hydrocarbons the contractor produces. But under the new contracts, the NIOC will set up joint ventures for crude oil and gas production with international companies which will be paid with a share of the output. Under the new contracts, different stages of exploration, development and production will be offered to contractors as an integrated package, with the emphasis laid on enhanced and improved recovery.

News article:
Iran’s media say the country has received the first wave of proposals by major international companies to develop oil and gas projects within the new format of oil contracts recently approved by the administration of President Hassan Rouhani. Tasnim News Agency reported that 10 companies have so far submitted their proposals to Iran’s Ministry of Petroleum for the development of 15 projects. They, Tasnim said in its report, include big European names such as Total, Lukoil, Shell, Eni, OMV and Asian giants like CNPC, Sinopec and Pertamina. Several of the key projects that the companies have targeted are the same ones they had been previously involved in or for which they had been negotiating with Iran in the past. The most lucrative project up for the grabs may be South Azadegan for which Total has presented its proposal. South Azadegan was discovered in 2001 in what was described at the time as the world’s biggest oil find in decades. Next in line could be Yadavaran for which both Shell and Sinopec have presented their proposals. Total and Shell had been negotiating with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) in early 2000s over the development of South Azadegan and Yadavaran but their talks did not lead to an agreement. Shell has also bid for the re-development of Soroush oil field – located in the Persian Gulf - which it had previously developed in early 2000s. Total, Eni and Hyundai have presented proposals for unspecified phases of South Pars gas field. Total was already involved in the development of South Pars Phases 2 and 3. Eni was involved in the development of Phases 4 and 5 and Hyundai in Phases 4, 5 and 6. Iran’s new format of oil contracts is replacing buyback deals. Under a buyback deal, the host government agrees to pay the contractor an agreed price for all volumes of hydrocarbons the contractor produces. But under the new contracts, the NIOC will set up joint ventures for crude oil and gas production with international companies which will be paid with a share of the output. Under the new contracts, different stages of exploration, development and production will be offered to contractors as an integrated package, with the emphasis laid on enhanced and improved recovery.

News article:
BP, Hungary buy first post-sanctions Iran oil British oil company BP has clinched its first oil deal with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) since last year’s landmark nuclear accord for purchase of condensate, a NIOC official says. Under the deal, BP will receive South Pars condensate for loading between September and October, the unnamed official was quoted as saying on Wednesday. Director of NIOC’s international affairs Mohsen Qamsari said on Monday that BP would get a cargo of one million barrels of Iranian condensate, based on a spot contract. He said another firm had also purchased condensate but did not identify it, only saying Iran was negotiating to sell crude to British companies. BP has a long history of operation in Iran. The company started life as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1908 before parting ways with Iran and becoming British Petroleum. NIOC and BP equally own the Rhum gas field in the North Sea, which was shut down for four years due to Western sanctions. Condensate is a type of light crude oil produced in association with natural gas. Iran’s total crude oil and condensate sales likely reached around 2.8 million barrels per day in September, nearly matching a 2011 peak in shipments before sanctions were imposed, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Iran sold 600,000 bpd of condensate for September, including about 100,000 bpd shipped from storage, to meet robust demand in Asia, the news agency said. The sale to BP marks another milestone in NIOC’s efforts to win back its former customers around the world, including those in Europe, after the lifting of sanctions. France’s Total was the first European oil major to resume purchases of Iranian oil in February this year while Royal Dutch Shell shipped a cargo of Iranian crude to Europe in July. Hungary’s MOL said on Tuesday it has commissioned a cargo of 140,000 tonnes of Iranian heavy crude oil on Oct. 23 for the first time since the lifting of sanctions. “Since sanctions against Iran are lifted, Iranian crude has become part of these alternative crude grades MOL is actively considering for use in its refineries,” an MOL spokeswoman was quoted as saying by Reuters. The cargo will be delivered from Iran’s Kharg Island terminal to Croatian port of Omisalj, the report said. The world’s second largest private oil trader, Trafigura, has also been in talks to supply Iran’s heavy crude grade to independent processors in China for the first time. Trafigura loaded 2 million barrels of Iranian heavy crude for the first time in June. Independent processors, known as teapots, typically buy shipments at short notice and in small quantities. The arrangement is expected to further boost Iran’s resurgent rise in the oil market. The country has surprised the market by ramping up its oil output faster than expected, to 3.63 million bpd in August, according to OPEC. Iran aims to increase exports to 2.35 million barrels a day in coming months from about 2.2 million barrels a day (bpd), Qamsari said on Sunday. The Shana news agency quoted NIOC Managing Director Ali Kardor as saying that Iran’s crude oil production capacity must reach 5.2 to 5.7 million bpd in the future. By Press TV

TEHRAN, Oct. 07 (MNA) – The OMV group, the international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Vienna, is negotiating for a long term contract of crude oil with National Iranian Oil Company. “Iran’s oil export to Austria has kicked off through spot contracts,” said Seyed Mohsen Ghamsari, Executive Director for International Affairs at National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), when asked about the latest status of Iran-Austria oil trade and the agreements signed with the OMV group, an integrated international oil and gas company headquartered in Austrian capital city of Vienna. The official announced that so far a cargo of 1 million barrels of crude oil has been delivered to the OMV group and concurrently the talks for signing a long term contract of oil sale to the Austrians are underway. “No final agreement has been reached yet,” reiterated the board member of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), “hence no volume of oil trade for the long term contract has been agreed upon.” Two weeks ago, the OMV group announced that the company has received an Iranian cargo of 1 million barrels of crude oil at Italian port of Trieste.

News article:
Belarus, Iran in talks on oil supplies – President Belarusian President said that Belarus is in talks with Iran on supplies of oil. MINSK (Sputnik) —Belarus is in talks with Iran on supplies of oil, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said Friday. “We have been in talks with Iran which is desperately trying to find an oil market and is ready to lower prices,” Lukashenko told Belarusian lawmakers. He added that the country’s refineries should not face shortage of oil deliveries and should receive crude oil to the full extent. Belarus faces decline in oil deliveries from Russia. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said that the decrease in deliveries was linked to Minsk’s gas debt and shortfall of petrochemicals’ deliveries to Russia. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich said that the level of deliveries could be restored if Moscow and Minsk reached an agreement on the gas debt. Moscow and Minsk have been locked in talks over the price of Russian gas supplied to Belarusian consumers. In July, Novak said that Belarus owed $270 million in unpaid gas bills to Russia. Minsk has been refusing to recognize the debt, saying that the price of $132.77 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas demanded by Moscow is unfair. Russia has stressed that payments must be made in line with the contract. At the same time, the Belarusian leader said that oil and gas issues should not be mixed. By Sputnik

News article:
State-run energy giant Pertamina officially received a cargo of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from Iran on Oct.13, marking Iran’s first shipment as a new supplier of LPG to Indonesia, The Jakarta Post reported. Pertamina president director Dwi Soetjipto welcomed the 44,000 metric tons of LPG transported from Asaluyeh Port in Iran 13 days ago by its VLGC Pertamina Gas 2 vessel, at Kalbut Port in Situbondo, East Java. According to him, the LPG shipment from the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) would open up other business development opportunities between Pertamina and the NIOC, in both the upstream and downstream sectors. "It marks a new chapter of cooperation between Pertamina and the NIOC and makes trade cooperation between Indonesia and Iran more significant," Dwi said in a statement on Thursday. Earlier, the NIOC agreed to supply Pertamina with a total volume of 600,000 tons of LPG for 2016 and 2017. Following the arrival of the first cargo, the NIOC will immediately send the next cargo, which is expected to arrive on Nov. 20. In addition to the LPG purchase , the two state-run companies signed an agreement to conduct a preliminary study of two giant oil fields in Iran, namely Ab-Teymour and Mansouri, which have an oil reserve of more than 5 billion barrels.

News article:
Iran has invited international companies to begin bidding for the country’s vast oil and gas fields for the first time since the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal was implemented in January of this year. Foreign companies will be able to bid for exploration and production of Iran’s oil and gas starting today, according to the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC). The NIOC has said that it will be giving priority to neighboring countries that share border fields, which include 28 joint offshore and onshore gas and oil reserves. Since bidding began, Iran has already signed several agreements. The first company to sign is the domestic Iranian organization Persia Oil & Gas Industry Development Co. The US Treasury claims that this company is a subsidiary of Setad Ejraiye Farman-e Emam, or Setad – an organization with strong ties to the Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Setad is known for its shadowy dealings within the Islamic Republic. The company provides Ayatollah Khamenei with immense economic strength as it holds significant real estate and corporate investments. One of the leaders of Setad has been wanted by the United States since 2013 on arms smuggling charges. Iran has also signed agreements with two British companies, including British Petroleum (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell. French Company Total SA has also resumed oil trade with Iran – in 2010 it was forced to stop all oil exploration and production in the country as a result of international sanctions placed on Iran. International sanctions on Iran were lifted in January under the JCPOA deal, allowing for Iran to expand trade with the international community. The country was slapped with sanctions by the United Nations Security Council and the EU as a result of intelligence that suggested Iran’s nuclear program – which it claimed was for peaceful use – was instead being used for clandestine weapons development. The international community signed an agreement with Iran that prevented the country from producing nuclear weapons in exchange for the dropping of sanctions. Iran’s oil production exceeds 3.5 million barrels of crude oil per day, compared to approximately 10 million barrels per day produced by Saudi Arabia in 2015. The country hopes to bring more than $150 billion in foreign investment by 2020. DL

'Following the signing of the agreement, Total is going to participate in developing a lower olefin project which is going to cost at least two billion dollars,' Adel Nejad Salim told the Islamic Republic News Agency in an exclusive interview.Nejad Salim also said that the Persian Gulf Holding so far has signed seven memorandums of understanding with international companies, including the European companies like Total.It is expected that, two agreements be finalized until the end of the current Iranian calendar year, he said.'One of them is going to be with Total,' Nejad Salim said.Managing Director of the Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industry said that the company is eager to absorb domestic and foreign investments.Lower olefins are petrochemical derivatives produced by cracking feedstocks from raw materials such as natural gas and crude oil. The main olefin products are ethylene, propylene, butadiene and C4 derivatives.These petrochemical derivatives are used to produce plastics, as chemical intermediates, and, in some cases, as industrial solvents.2044**

TEHRAN, Oct. 30 (MNA) – A Fresh round of oil negotiations was conducted between Iran’s NIOC and Hungary’s MOL Group over inking long-term crude sale contracts. Executive Director for International Affairs at National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) Seyyed Mohsen Ghamsari made a visit to Budapest and began a new round of talks with MOL, the largest integrated oil and gas company from Hungary, to ink long-term and permanent contracts for crude oil sales. During his stay in Hungary, Iran’s Ghamsari, in addition to attending a meeting with MOL officials, made a visit to a Hungarian refinery. Other axes of talks between Iranian and Hungarian officials in Budapest, apart from long-term sales of crude oil, included investments in upstream and downstream sectors of Iran’s oil industry. Negotiations kick off in the European country at a time when Iran has recently shipped one million barrels of crude oil to Hungary. MOL Group of Hungary had previously made an official proposal to NIOC calling for a daily import of 30 to 40 thousand barrels of Iran’s light oil. Nevertheless, restrictions on light oil production and high capacity of heavy crude had remained as the main barriers to exports of Iranian crude to Hungary as an oil consumer in the Eastern Bloc. Meanwhile, implementation of the first developmental phase of Khesht oilfield in southern Iran will provide the possibility to produce 20 thousand barrels of light oil enough to supply Hungary’s crude demand.

Moscow and Tehran are in talks over a potential exclusive presentation of Iran’s oil and gas contracts to Russian companies, Russia’s Deputy Energy Minister Kirill Molodtsov said, TASS reported. Molodtsov added that the sides have reached this agreement and currently the place and date are being discussed. “We expect the agreements reached by heads of two ministries – of energy [of the Russian Federation] and Iran’s Petroleum Ministry – about a potential exclusive presentation of the current conditions and contracts, under which the Islamic Republic of Iran is planning to attract foreign companies and foreign investments in the projects on its soil, to be presented to Russian companies,” he said. “Respective notes and respective documents have been sent and we are expecting a response from the Iranian side about the date and location,” Molodtsov added. Amir Hossein Zamaninia, Iranian deputy oil minister, has, in turn, said that Lukoil, Gazprom, Rosneft, Gazprom Neft, Zarubezhneft and Tatneft have made preliminary agreements with Iranian companies. Iran intends to sign first contracts with Russian oil producers by the end of 2016, Zamaninia said earlier.

Baku, Azerbaijan, Nov. 11 By Emil Ilgar – Trend: France’s Total has willingness to work in Iran-Iraq joint North Azadegan oil field, while BP and Royal Dutch Shell are negotiating with Iran to develop independent oil fields in southern regions of the country, the Managing Director of National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for Engineering and Development Affairs Gholam-Reza Manouchehri told Fars Nov. 11. He said Iran is also in talks with Chinese companies on North Azadegan and Yadavaran fields, both are joint with Iraq. Manouchehri also said that BP and Shell are keen to develop several independent fields, but the talks have not been finalized. He didn’t name any fields, but Fars reported citing anonymous oil officials that BP wants to work in one of four fields, namely Kananj, Parsi, Rag Sefid or Shayegan. All of them are in operation area of state-run National Iranian South Oil Company, which produces 3 million barrels per day, or 82 percent of Iran’s total crude oil output currently. IRNA also quoted Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh Nov. 11 as saying that the country would announce a tender on Azadegan, and Total is to compete with other foreign companies to win the project. Total, Shell and BP resumed crude oil purchase in spot from Iran after removal of nuclear sanctions in January 2016. Last week, Total, Chinese CNPC and Iran’s Petropars signed a heads of agreement to develop Phase 11 of South Pars gas field to produce 56 million cubic meters of gas per day.

News article:
Iran has signed an agreement with Norway’s DNO to study the development of a key oil field which is believed to be jointly shared with Iraq in a yet another sign that shows Western companies are already welcoming the country’s lucrative post-sanctions investment opportunities. The agreement – which DNO signed with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) - involves studying Changuleh oil field which sits on Iran’s border with Iraq in the western province of Ilam. Based on the agreement, Norway’s fourth largest oil and gas company will study Changuleh within six months – a crucial move that could enable it to win a deal to develop the field once the related talks with the NIOC succeed. NIOC Director for Engineering and Development Affairs Gholam-Reza Manouchehri told reporters after signing the agreement with DNO’s Managing Director Bjorn Dale that the field could be linked to another nearby field named Azar. Iran had previously announced that Azar, itself, was linked to Iraq’s Badra oil field. A domestic company – Sarvak Azar Engineering and Development Company – is already pushing ahead the development of the field with a target production of 65,000 barrels per day (bpd). The target production of Changuleh is 50,000 bpd. Azar and Changuleh were discovered in 2005 as a result of explorations conducted by a consortium comprising Russia’s Lukoil and Norway’s Statoil. Both fields – together with Iraq’s Badra – are believed to hold an in-place reserve of about 3.5 billion barrels. NIOC awarded the project to develop Changuleh to DNO only a week after it signed a major deal with the French energy giant Total over the development of a key gas field in Persian Gulf waters. Accordingly, Total will lead a consortium comprising China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) and Iran’s Petropars over the development of Phase 11 of the country’s huge South Pars gas field. The value of the deal has been estimated at $4.8 billion.

News article:
At a February 4, 2015 political conference in Gaza, Dr. Mahmoud Al-Zahar, from the Hamas political leadership, called on Syria and Lebanon to enable the establishment of military cells subordinate to Hamas’s military wing, the ‘Izz Al-Din Al-Qassam Brigades, in refugee camps on their soil “so that they can run the resistance from northern Palestine [as well] and participate with us in its liberation.”[1] This statement by a high-ranking Hamas official shows that the movement intends to open a second front against Israel from Syria and Lebanon, which it has thus far refrained from doing. Following Al-Zahar’s statements, ‘Emad Zaqout, news division chief at Hamas’s Al-Aqsa TV, wrote in an article titled “What is the Secret of Dr. Al-Zahar’s Statement?” that Hamas wants every conflict with Israel to be all-out, and to include attacks on Israel from its northern border as well. Zaqout even revealed that during the recent Gaza conflict, rockets had been launched into Israel from Lebanon by elements operated by the Al-Qassam Brigades. Following are excerpts from his article: “In the recent Gaza war, which lasted some two months, the Al-Qassam Brigades operated several groups in Arab countries bordering occupied Palestine, so that they could launch some rockets at cities in northern occupied Palestine and cause confusion in the assessments of the Zionist enemy. “It seems that Hamas’s leadership thinks, and is planning, that every future war against the Zionist enemy will be all-out, meaning that it will encompass every inch of land in Palestine, and make matters difficult for the enemy. The leadership began preparing for this immediately after the Gaza campaign, and possibly even during it. “In this context, ties were renewed between Hamas and Hizbullah, which motivated Dr. Mahmoud Al-Zahar, a member of Hamas’s political leadership, to state at a political conference recently held by Hamas’s information office in northern Gaza that the movement is working to establish groups belonging to the Al-Qassam Brigades in Lebanese refugee camps close to northern Palestine. “I believe that Al-Zahar’s statements were made in coordination with high-ranking Hizbullah officials. Also worthy of mention is the letter sent by the fighting [Al-Qassam Brigades commander] Muhammad Deif to Hizbullah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah, asking him for crossfire in occupied Palestine from the resistance. “The question is whether Dr. Al-Zahar’s statements also apply to the Palestinian presence in Syria, Jordan, and even Egypt.”[2] [1] Al-Hayat (London), February 6, 2015.

Following Al-Zahar’s statements, ‘Emad Zaqout, news division chief at Hamas’s Al-Aqsa TV, wrote in an article titled “What is the Secret of Dr. Al-Zahar’s Statement?” that Hamas wants every conflict with Israel to be all-out, and to include attacks on Israel from its northern border as well. Zaqout even revealed that during the recent Gaza conflict, rockets had been launched into Israel from Lebanon by elements operated by the Al-Qassam Brigades. Following are excerpts from his article: “In the recent Gaza war, which lasted some two months, the Al-Qassam Brigades operated several groups in Arab countries bordering occupied Palestine, so that they could launch some rockets at cities in northern occupied Palestine and cause confusion in the assessments of the Zionist enemy. “It seems that Hamas’s leadership thinks, and is planning, that every future war against the Zionist enemy will be all-out, meaning that it will encompass every inch of land in Palestine, and make matters difficult for the enemy. The leadership began preparing for this immediately after the Gaza campaign, and possibly even during it. “In this context, ties were renewed between Hamas and Hizbullah, which motivated Dr. Mahmoud Al-Zahar, a member of Hamas’s political leadership, to state at a political conference recently held by Hamas’s information office in northern Gaza that the movement is working to establish groups belonging to the Al-Qassam Brigades in Lebanese refugee camps close to northern Palestine. “I believe that Al-Zahar’s statements were made in coordination with high-ranking Hizbullah officials. Also worthy of mention is the letter sent by the fighting [Al-Qassam Brigades commander] Muhammad Deif to Hizbullah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah, asking him for crossfire in occupied Palestine from the resistance. “The question is whether Dr. Al-Zahar’s statements also apply to the Palestinian presence in Syria, Jordan, and even Egypt.”[2] [1] Al-Hayat (London), February 6, 2015.

News article:
If Hamas has the resources to fund and arm a new “Liberation Army” consisting of 17,000 fighters, why does it continue to demand that the international community allocate billions of dollars for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip? Hamas has turned the Gaza Strip into a huge training camp for jihadis and militiamen affiliated not only with it, but also with the Islamic State. Hamas leader Mahmoud Zahar declared that some of the boys would be recruited to fire mortars and rockets at Israel. And of course, he reiterated Hamas’s true goal, namely the destruction of Israel. When Hamas talks about “liberation,” it means it wants to wipe Israel off the face of the earth and replace it with an Islamic state. Obviously, the Palestinian Authority and its leader, Mahmoud Abbas, do not see Hamas’s cynical exploitation and abuse of Palestinian children as a war crime. If and when the International Criminal Court convenes to consider “war crimes” in the Middle East, the first thing the judges should consider is how Hamas sent thousands of Palestinian teenagers to their deaths, and, as this was happening, how Abbas and the Palestinian Authority looked the other way. For the past several months, Hamas leaders have been complaining that they do not have enough money to rebuild the Gaza Strip in the aftermath of the last war with Israel. However, it appears that Hamas does have enough funds to train, arm and indoctrinate thousands of young Palestinian men and boys. While thousands of Palestinian families who lost their houses during the war continue to live in public shelters throughout the Gaza Strip, Hamas recently established 18 camps for military training. The Hamas military training camps, under the motto “Vanguards of Liberation,” have attracted some 17,000 Palestinian males aged 15-21. The young recruits were trained how to use various types of weapons, including pistols, rifles and mortars. They were also “educated” about the need to eliminate Israel and “restore Palestinian rights.” Samir Abu Aitah, a 15-year-old boy who joined the Hamas-run militia, said: “I now feel very happy because they trained me how to use weapons so that I could fight against the soldiers of the occupation. The Jews have killed thousands of innocent people and that’s why I decided to join the path of jihad (holy war) and fight against them with weapons. We want to expel the Jews from our occupied country.” Another 15-year-old boy, Mahmoud al-Kurd, said he really enjoyed being trained with weapons at Hamas’s camps. “Our enemy understands only one language – the language of swords.” Al-Kurd’s friend, Ismail Elayan, who is also 15, told reporters who visited the training camps: “I decided to join the camp because this will pave the way for liberating all of our country. This is our major goal.” Mohamed al-Najjar, 16, said he joined the training camps because he “loves martyrdom.” He added: “I want to pursue the path of resistance until I’m martyred.” Hamas later held a “graduation ceremony” for the young recruits who are expected to serve in its future “Liberation Army.” And when Hamas talks about “liberation,” it means it wants to wipe Israel off the face of the earth and replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas is even boasting that the young Palestinians who have just been brainwashed and trained on weapons will participate in the next war with Israel.

(Image source: Paltimes) Speaking at one of the graduation ceremonies, Hamas co-founder and senior official Mahmoud Zahar declared that some of the boys would be recruited to fire mortars and rockets at Israel. And, of course, he reiterated Hamas’s true goal, namely the destruction of Israel. “These young men will soon be standing behind the rockets, which they will fire at every inch of Palestine until it is completely liberated,” Zahar said. “These boys will liberate Palestine and the Aqsa Mosque. Hamas will continue to support the training camps and provide them with as much funds and weapons as they need. This will continue until we achieve our goal — the liberation of Palestine.” So Zahar is actually admitting that Hamas is not facing a financial crisis, as it has no problem funding any program designed to poison the hearts and minds of Palestinian youths. Nor does Hamas have any problem supplying the youths with weapons, according to the Hamas leader.

The money that was spent on the “Vanguards of Liberation” training camps could have solved the problems facing thousands of Palestinian families who lost their homes during last summer’s war (Operation Protective Edge). But Hamas, which is first and foremost responsible for the tragedy of these families, is not interested in taking any part in the efforts to rebuild destroyed homes. Instead, Hamas seems to be more determined than ever to continue raising new generations of Palestinians on jihad and hatred. Hamas has turned the Gaza Strip into a huge training camp for jihadis and militiamen affiliated not only with it, but also with the Islamic State. By forming a new army that consists mostly of teenagers, Hamas is committing a crime against Palestinians in general and young people in particular. This is all happening at a time when the Palestinian Authority [PA] in the West Bank continues with its threats to file “war crimes” charges against Israel. Obviously, the PA and its leader, Mahmoud Abbas, do not see Hamas’s cynical exploitation and abuse of Palestinian children as a war crime. Hamas has made it clear that it plans to send the teenagers to launch rockets and mortars at Israel, with the hope that they would achieve “martyrdom.” But this does not seem to bother Abbas or the Palestinian Authority, or even the international community.

News article:
Gaza fears isolation as Egypt calls Hamas 'terrorist' group GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Gaza residents said Sunday they fear growing isolation and more hardships after an Egyptian court declared the territory's ruling Hamas a terrorist organization. Some blamed the Islamic militant Hamas while others said Egypt is being unreasonable. Hamas called for protests against the Egyptian government and issued angry statements, but did not offer a way out of the crisis. Salah Bardaweel, a Hamas spokesman, alleged Sunday that Egypt has become a "direct agent" of Israeli interests. Saturday's court ruling signaled Egypt's growing hostility toward Hamas, an offshoot of the region-wide Muslim Brotherhood. Egypt has blamed Hamas for violence in the country's restive Sinai Peninsula, a charge Hamas denies. FILE - In this Dec. 14, 2014 file photo, masked Palestinian Hamas gunmen display their military skills during a rally to commemorate the 27th anniversary of the Hamas militant group, in Gaza City, Gaza. An Egyptian court declared Hamas a "terrorist organization" Saturday, Feb. 28, 2015, further isolating the rulers of the Gaza Strip who once found a warm welcome under the country's past Islamist government. The ruling described Hamas as targeting both civilians and security forces inside Egypt's restive Sinai Peninsula and aiming to harm the country. (AP Photo/Khalil Hamra, File) Hamas seized Gaza by force in 2007, and the territory's borders have been largely sealed by Israel and Egypt since then. Egypt intensified the blockade after its military toppled a Hamas-friendly government in Cairo in 2013. In recent months, Egyptian soldiers have destroyed virtually all smuggling tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border. In October, they began razing parts of the Egyptian town of Rafah on the border with Gaza. Residents near the border said homes are still being dynamited or bulldozed at a steady pace, with the latest explosion heard Sunday afternoon. The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, Gaza's main gateway to the world, mostly has been closed since October. This year, it was only open for two days, leaving thousands unable to get out of the territory, including Muslim pilgrims and students at foreign universities. The tunnel closures have put an end to the smuggling of cheap fuel and cement from Egypt, further hurting a crippled Gaza economy and driving up unemployment. Cigarette prices have tripled. Some in Gaza blamed Hamas, saying it's time the militant group to moderate or hand over control to the Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, from whom it seized Gaza. "Hamas is taking us hostage for the sake of its own interest," university graduate Ahmed Tiri said. Hamas rules Gaza with an iron grip, and such open criticism is relatively rare. Last year, Abbas and Hamas had reached a deal under which an Abbas-led government of experts would oversee reconstruction of Gaza following the devastating 2014 war between Israel and Hamas. However, the agreement was never implemented, with both sides unwilling to compromise. Walid Abu Hassouna, a barber, said he expects Egypt to tighten the closure of Gaza. "If they could deprive us of the air we breathe, they would do it," he said. Some said Hamas should try to negotiate with Egypt to improve the lives of Gaza's 1.8 million people. Hamas was inflexible for too long and must now seek Arab mediators to appeal to Egypt, Gaza analyst Akram Attallah said. "Hamas did not move. It was like waiting for something from the heavens to resolve the issue," he said. He said the group also made a mistake by acting as a mouthpiece of the Brotherhood.

Gaza fears isolation as Egypt calls Hamas 'terrorist' group GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Gaza residents said Sunday they fear growing isolation and more hardships after an Egyptian court declared the territory's ruling Hamas a terrorist organization. Some blamed the Islamic militant Hamas while others said Egypt is being unreasonable. Hamas called for protests against the Egyptian government and issued angry statements, but did not offer a way out of the crisis. Salah Bardaweel, a Hamas spokesman, alleged Sunday that Egypt has become a "direct agent" of Israeli interests. Saturday's court ruling signaled Egypt's growing hostility toward Hamas, an offshoot of the region-wide Muslim Brotherhood. Egypt has blamed Hamas for violence in the country's restive Sinai Peninsula, a charge Hamas denies. FILE - In this Dec. 14, 2014 file photo, masked Palestinian Hamas gunmen display their military skills during a rally to commemorate the 27th anniversary of the Hamas militant group, in Gaza City, Gaza. An Egyptian court declared Hamas a "terrorist organization" Saturday, Feb. 28, 2015, further isolating the rulers of the Gaza Strip who once found a warm welcome under the country's past Islamist government. The ruling described Hamas as targeting both civilians and security forces inside Egypt's restive Sinai Peninsula and aiming to harm the country. (AP Photo/Khalil Hamra, File) Hamas seized Gaza by force in 2007, and the territory's borders have been largely sealed by Israel and Egypt since then. Egypt intensified the blockade after its military toppled a Hamas-friendly government in Cairo in 2013. In recent months, Egyptian soldiers have destroyed virtually all smuggling tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border. In October, they began razing parts of the Egyptian town of Rafah on the border with Gaza. Residents near the border said homes are still being dynamited or bulldozed at a steady pace, with the latest explosion heard Sunday afternoon. The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, Gaza's main gateway to the world, mostly has been closed since October. This year, it was only open for two days, leaving thousands unable to get out of the territory, including Muslim pilgrims and students at foreign universities. The tunnel closures have put an end to the smuggling of cheap fuel and cement from Egypt, further hurting a crippled Gaza economy and driving up unemployment. Cigarette prices have tripled. Some in Gaza blamed Hamas, saying it's time the militant group to moderate or hand over control to the Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, from whom it seized Gaza.

News article:
Gaza – A senior Hamas military official said Monday his Palestinian Islamist group which controls Gaza is rebuilding its heavily depleted rocket arsenal in case of fresh conflict with Israel. “Any regional or international attempt to lay siege to Hamas or its armed wing is bound to fail,” said Marwan Eissa, a commander of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades armed wing. Hamas was “not looking for confrontation” with Israel, he said, quoted by Hamas-run news agency Al-Ray. “But we are making sure our forces are reinforced in case of a confrontation. We’re continuing to make rockets.” Hamas fired thousands of rockets at Israel during a July-August conflict in and around the Gaza Strip when an Israeli military campaign killed nearly 2,200 Palestinians, most of them civilians. Militant fire killed 73 people on the Israeli side, mostly soldiers. Six months after the conflict ended, there has been no reconstruction of Israeli-blockaded Gaza and more than 100,000 Palestinians are still homeless. Hamas has been struggling to pay its security forces due to Egypt’s destruction of cross-border tunnels used to ferry in supplies.

News article:
Yoav Galant, a former IDF general running for Knesset with the centrist Kulanu party, charged Saturday that the government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu largely ignored the tunnel threat posed by Hamas in the Gaza Strip until Operation Protective Edge last summer. Some 30 tunnels dug under the Gaza Strip leading into Israeli territory were exposed and demolished during the war. One led into a kibbutz dining hall, another into a kindergarten in communities bordering the Palestinian enclave. Some of the tunnels were also used to ambush and attack IDF soldiers during the war. “When there are tunnels, the government knows about it and the defense minister knows about it and no one did anything, and that’s unacceptable,” Galant said at a cultural event in Beersheba, according to Ynet. “Thirty-something tunnels are not built in a day. After Operation Cast Lead [in 2008-2009], there were no tunnels. This is negligence. The State of Israel essentially allowed 30 tunnels [to be built] and to me, this is unacceptable,” he said. Galant, a former candidate for IDF chief of staff, said that the next round of violence with Hamas will likely occur over the next four years and that the Israeli public is being misled on the situation in the Gaza Strip. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “The public thinks it’s [a choice between] a long, expensive war [and with minimal deaths on our side ] but with largely ineffectual results or rivers of blood,” he said. Galant, who was head of the Southern Command during Cast Lead, said he “forced Hamas to fight soldiers, not civilians” during that conflict and did so in less than half the time it took to conclude Protective Edge, and without the protection of the Iron Dome anti-missile system. “The public must decide who will lead the next round. Someone who has brought victory in the past and can do it again in the future or someone who reached a stalemate [with Hamas],” he said. Advertisement Galant has in the past run into some trouble for his sharp statements during this election campaign. Last month, he appeared to backpedal after he implied that an alleged Israeli attack on Hezbollah and Iranian personnel on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights in January was ordered out of political considerations and not just due to security concerns. Amos Yadlin, a retired general on the center-left Zionist Union list, also speaking at the cultural event Saturday took aim at Netanyahu for his controversial speech to Congress on Iran last week, charging that Israel was not under an existential threat. Dismissing comparisons between the period leading up to the Holocaust and present day, Yadlin said Israel now “has an army, and allies like the United States. Iran must be stopped in other ways.” Yadlin said Netanyahu’s insistence to speak to Congress over the objections — and fury — of the White House was “not smart.” “It was done for the sake of internal politics,” he said. Yadlin also criticized Netanyahu for the 50-day summer war with Hamas and for approving the release of hundreds of convicted Palestinian murderers, a reference to the 2011 Shalit deal (in which 1,027 Palestinians were released in exchange for Gilad Shalit who was held captive by Hamas for five years) and the release of some 80 prisoners in late 2013 and early 2014 as a gesture to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the framework of peace talks. Advertisement Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon, who was also at the event in Beersheba, rejected the two military men’s criticism over the handling of Operation Protective Edge “Defense is a complicated matter. It’s not the time for slogans and this isn’t child’s play. The use of military force has a price,” said Ya’alon. “We handled the operation responsibly,” he asserted. Meanwhile, the Iran-backed Islamic Jihad group said it was preparing for the next conflict with Israel. Six months ago, the Palestinian terrorist group emerged battered and bruised from the 50-day conflict with Israel, where it fought alongside fellow Islamist movement Hamas, which controls Gaza. Islamic Jihad’s armed wing the Al-Quds Brigades lost 123 men, but fired 3,249 rockets at the Jewish state, it says, including Iranian-made Fajr 5 missiles which reached Tel Aviv and even northern Israel. “We’re at our highest level of alert to counter any attack. We’re used to the occupation (Israel) breaking its ceasefires,” senior commander Abu al-Bara told AFP from one of the group’s tunnels. “What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger. We’re gathering all our strength since it’s a war that never ends. We’re ready to go to another level against the Zionist occupation and carry out actions we’ve never done before,” he said, without elaborating. Advertisement Israel launched Operation Protective Edge on July 8 to stop Hamas and other groups’ indiscriminate rocket fire on Israeli cities and to destroy the terror tunnels that infiltrate into Israeli territory. During the operation, Hamas rejected a number of ceasefire proposals and violated a number of those that were agreed to. Israel lost 66 soldiers and six civilians, and a Thai agricultural worker, in the month-long conflict while the Palestinian death toll surpassed 2,100, according to Hamas officials in Gaza. Israel said half of the Gaza dead were gunmen and blamed Hamas for all civilian deaths because it operated against Israel from residential areas, placing Gazans in harm’s way. Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other groups launched over 3,000 rockets indiscriminately at Israeli cities. The war ended on August 26 with a fragile Hamas-Israel ceasefire brokered by Egypt. AFP contributed to this report.

News article:
Premier David Ben Gurion served notice today that Israel reserves its freedom of action if there is any return of Egyptians to the Gaza Strip and, if the need arises, won’t announce its action in advance. He said concern expressed in the Knesset over the Gaza situation was not imaginary, but real. The Israeli leader takes sharp issue with Dr. Ralph J. Bunche, Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations, over a statement attributed to him that the United Nations Emergency Force was in Gaza only with the consent of Egypt. “It is not in the power of the Egyptian dictator to agree or disagree, since he was ignominiously expelled from the Strip.” Mr. Ben Gurion asserted. “I must add with regret that Dr. Bunche’s superiors in the United Nations have sometimes been more concerned with the prestige of the Egyptian dictator than with the fulfilment of Egypt’s international obligations and the preservation of peace in the Middle East. “In accordance with the Foreign Minister’s declaration in the General Assembly.” Mr. Ben Gurion announced, “Israel reserves its freedom of action in case the Egyptians return to the Strip which never belonged to them and which was used by them only for the purpose of attacks or threats against Israel. SAYS ISRAEL WILL NOT GIVE PRIOR NOTICE OF ITS ACTIONS “If the time comes when action is appropriate and necessary,” Mr. Ben Gurion declared, the Government of Israel will not, of course, give prior notice of its actions.” Two moves by opposition parties to subject the Government’s Gaza policy to Knesset review were defeated today. A General Zionist motion for debate was rejected by Parliament 51-24 and. Herut Party motion, 53-24. The rejections followed an unusual procedure in which Mr. Ben Gurion replied briefly only to the General Zionist motion and disdained reply to the Herut, merely asking the House to defeat the motion. The Achdut Avoda Party, a coalition member was not present for the voting. In introducing the Herut motion, Menachem Beigin, who cut short an American tour to return to Jerusalem, called for full discussion of the “catastrophic policy of the Government.” He accused Mr. Ben Gurion of a “putsch by a dictator giving orders to abandon parts of the homeland.” In his brief reply to the General Zionists, Mr. Ben Gurion admitted that the situation was worse today than when he last addressed the Knesset. ADMITS ISRAELI ARMY DEEPLY CONCERNED OVER GAZA WITHDRAWAL In response to questions in Parliament today, the Prime Minister admitted that the Israel Army and the border settlements had been deeply concerned over the Government decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip. He said he had met with representatives of both elements in an effort to explain the Government’s motives and reasons. Mr. Ben Gurion said an additional budget allowance of one million pounds had been made to strengthen the security of the border settlements. The Army, he said, had been instructed to prepare two detailed plans for ensuring the security of these settlements, one an “ideal” program and are based on the practical realities of the budget. Mr. Ben Gurion, who also holds the portfolio of Ministry of Defense, announced that with the return to Jerusalem of Mrs. Golda Meir, the Foreign Minister, he would, in coming weeks, devote practically all his time to security matters. This concentration, he said, was particularly required to ensure that overall budget cuts do not affect the strength of the Army and its capabilities. Meanwhile, the Israel Cabinet today recommended extension for another year of the special defense tax deducted from all salaries and business incomes. The tax extension is expected to bring in 55,000,000 pounds during the fiscal year. A like Gum will be saved through economies in the various government departments and cuts in civil service persuaded. Reports reaching here from Gaza state that Communist elements in the Gaza population, who went underground during the Israeli occupation, were reported today to have re-appeared and begun intensive activity in collaboration with extremist elements. The Communists are said to oppose the presence of United Nations Emergency Forces in the Strip as a strengthening of United Nations States position in the Middle East.

News article:
Premier David Ben Gurion served notice today that Israel reserves its freedom of action if there is any return of Egyptians to the Gaza Strip and, if the need arises, won’t announce its action in advance. He said concern expressed in the Knesset over the Gaza situation was not imaginary, but real. The Israeli leader takes sharp issue with Dr. Ralph J. Bunche, Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations, over a statement attributed to him that the United Nations Emergency Force was in Gaza only with the consent of Egypt. “It is not in the power of the Egyptian dictator to agree or disagree, since he was ignominiously expelled from the Strip.” Mr. Ben Gurion asserted. “I must add with regret that Dr. Bunche’s superiors in the United Nations have sometimes been more concerned with the prestige of the Egyptian dictator than with the fulfilment of Egypt’s international obligations and the preservation of peace in the Middle East. “In accordance with the Foreign Minister’s declaration in the General Assembly.” Mr. Ben Gurion announced, “Israel reserves its freedom of action in case the Egyptians return to the Strip which never belonged to them and which was used by them only for the purpose of attacks or threats against Israel. SAYS ISRAEL WILL NOT GIVE PRIOR NOTICE OF ITS ACTIONS “If the time comes when action is appropriate and necessary,” Mr. Ben Gurion declared, the Government of Israel will not, of course, give prior notice of its actions.” Two moves by opposition parties to subject the Government’s Gaza policy to Knesset review were defeated today. A General Zionist motion for debate was rejected by Parliament 51-24 and. Herut Party motion, 53-24. The rejections followed an unusual procedure in which Mr. Ben Gurion replied briefly only to the General Zionist motion and disdained reply to the Herut, merely asking the House to defeat the motion. The Achdut Avoda Party, a coalition member was not present for the voting. In introducing the Herut motion, Menachem Beigin, who cut short an American tour to return to Jerusalem, called for full discussion of the “catastrophic policy of the Government.” He accused Mr. Ben Gurion of a “putsch by a dictator giving orders to abandon parts of the homeland.” In his brief reply to the General Zionists, Mr. Ben Gurion admitted that the situation was worse today than when he last addressed the Knesset. ADMITS ISRAELI ARMY DEEPLY CONCERNED OVER GAZA WITHDRAWAL In response to questions in Parliament today, the Prime Minister admitted that the Israel Army and the border settlements had been deeply concerned over the Government decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip. He said he had met with representatives of both elements in an effort to explain the Government’s motives and reasons. Mr. Ben Gurion said an additional budget allowance of one million pounds had been made to strengthen the security of the border settlements. The Army, he said, had been instructed to prepare two detailed plans for ensuring the security of these settlements, one an “ideal” program and are based on the practical realities of the budget. Mr. Ben Gurion, who also holds the portfolio of Ministry of Defense, announced that with the return to Jerusalem of Mrs. Golda Meir, the Foreign Minister, he would, in coming weeks, devote practically all his time to security matters. This concentration, he said, was particularly required to ensure that overall budget cuts do not affect the strength of the Army and its capabilities. Meanwhile, the Israel Cabinet today recommended extension for another year of the special defense tax deducted from all salaries and business incomes. The tax extension is expected to bring in 55,000,000 pounds during the fiscal year. A like Gum will be saved through economies in the various government departments and cuts in civil service persuaded. Reports reaching here from Gaza state that Communist elements in the Gaza population, who went underground during the Israeli occupation, were reported today to have re-appeared and begun intensive activity in collaboration with extremist elements. The Communists are said to oppose the presence of United Nations Emergency Forces in the Strip as a strengthening of United Nations States position in the Middle East.

News article:
The Hamas-held interior ministry in the Gaza Strip on Saturday accused security forces reporting to the rival Palestinian Authority of being behind a wave of violence in the coastal enclave. Spokesman Iyad al-Bozum accused "members of the former security establishment in Gaza" of "exploiting the difficult conditions, especially since the last war, to spread chaos and confusion with explosions, car burnings and shootings." The war to which he referred was last summer's conflict with Israel. Palestinian Authority security forces were ousted from Gaza in 2007 by fighters from the Islamist Hamas movement's armed wing. Bozum did not elaborate, but explosions have targeted vehicles used by Hamas in recent months, as well as some owned by members of PA president Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party. He told a news conference investigations had shown the incidents were "the result of plans by security chiefs in Ramallah", headquarters of the PA in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Bozum said they were aimed at "spreading chaos in Gaza in order to cover up the government's failure and absolve him (Abbas) from any responsibility." Since last spring, when Hamas signed a reconciliation deal with the PA, it has accused the government of independents created under the agreement of abandoning Gaza. In return, the PA accuses Hamas of raising obstacles to the work of the government in the enclave, where it is reluctant to transfer power. Relations between Fatah and Hamas have been further strained since November, when a series of blasts targeted the homes of a dozen Fatah officials in Gaza, causing damage but no casualties. Bozum told reporters several suspects have been arrested and played recordings he said were of them, their voices distorted and images blurred. Bozum said they were members of the PA security services in Gaza before 2007 claiming to have carried out the attacks after receiving orders from Ramallah. WAFA, the official Palestinian news agency, issued a statement from Fatah rejecting the accusation. It reported Fatah spokesman Usama al-Qawasmi as dismissing "Hamas lies that nobody believes because everyone knows it imposes its will by force". Qawasmi accused Hamas itself of "being behind explosions and car burnings."

News article:
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Rivals Hamas and Fatah have traded some of the harshest accusations in months, raising fresh doubt about their ability to work together to rebuild areas of the Gaza Strip destroyed in last year’s Israel-Hamas war. Hamas, which rules Gaza, claimed over the weekend that the Fatah-run government in the West Bank ordered supporters to carry out several bombings in Gaza to create chaos. Hamas released videos purportedly showing confessions of three men involved in the alleged plot. Gaza Interior Ministry spokesman Iyad Bozum also claimed that Fatah ordered supporters in Gaza to relay information about Hamas’ military infrastructure. Adnan Damiri, a spokesman for Fatah-loyal forces in the West Bank, on Sunday dismissed the purported confession videos as forgeries. He said Hamas is making such claims to distract from its failure in governing Gaza. Last week, Palestinian security forces arrested several dozen Hamas supporters in the West Bank. The sweep came several days after Hamas detained several Fatah activists in Gaza.

The current plan calls for a Hamas-backed technocrat government headed by Fatah’s leader, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. This unity government was to replace the rule of Hamas, which had seized Gaza in 2007, but the two sides have failed to make the agreement work. The political paralysis is seen as a major reason for the slow reconstruction pace.

The office of the Israeli military dealing with Gaza affairs said Sunday that more than 91,000 tons of construction materials have entered the territory since October.

News article:
Twelve years after Purim celebrations in Israel marked the end of the first Persian Gulf War, Israelis spent the holiday this week preparing for the next war. With an American attack on Iraq imminent, the Israel Defense Force’s Home Front Command on Tuesday ordered the public to prepare sealed rooms for protection against potential chemical or biological attack. The army said the public should not yet open their gas mask kits. Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz said President Bush’s speech Monday giving dictator Saddam Hussein and his sons 48 hours to leave Iraq or face war motivated the decision to heighten the level of civil defense readiness. At the same time, Mofaz reiterated the view that an Iraqi attack on Israel in response to a U.S.-led military strike was very unlikely. “Our assessment hasn’t changed. The threat is low and our preparedness is high,” Mofaz said during a visit Tuesday to the special broadcasting studios set up by the Home Front Command. “What changed was the speech of President Bush early this morning, essentially giving a clear ultimatum to Saddam Hussein and Iraq, and determining a timetable that when this ultimatum expires, the American strike is inevitable.” The defense minister went on to add that Israelis should not alter their regular routine because of the heightened state of civil defense preparations. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was due to convene security and political consultations to discuss the situation. The order to prepare sealed rooms came hours before Iraq rejected Bush’s ultimatum. It also came a day after the army formally instructed the public to acquire materials to prepare sealed rooms in their homes. The army also issued call-up orders for several hundred reservists who serve in the Home Front Command and anti-aircraft units. The civil preparations, detailed in an instruction booklet distributed by the Home Front Command several weeks ago, included purchasing plastic sheeting and duct tape to seal a room; stocking up on bottled water and canned and dry foods; buying batteries for radios and flashlights in the event of a power outage; and packing a personal bag for each family member in the event of an evacuation due to a nonconventional attack. The directive was the latest in a series of phased civil defense preparations that have been implemented over the past several months. They included a campaign calling on the population to update their gas mask kits, an information booklet on preparing a sealed room and what to do in the event of attack, and an advisory to stock up on supplies needed to prepare sealed rooms. The instructions didn’t help an Israeli Arab woman and her two teen-aged sons, who suffocated while sleeping in a sealed room the family had prepared in case of a possible Iraqi attack. The woman, 37, and her 13- and 14-year-old sons died from lack of oxygen due Sunday night to a coal-run heater they used to warm the room. The father of the family and two smaller children survived. At the same time, military defensive measures have been implemented, including the deployment in Israel of American Patriot missile batteries to back up Israel’s Arrow anti-missile system, and a raised level of alertness in the Israeli air force. The latest developments followed months in which Israelis have lived in uncertainty over how the Iraqi crisis will play out. Maj.-Gen. Amos Gilad, chosen to serve as a “national commentator” during the conflict, rejected criticism that the army’s gradual approach to preparing the public was confusing. “The easy decision could have been to” tell the public “to open the masks three months ago,” he said on Israel Radio. “The correct decision has to be taken at the right time.” As part of the heightened readiness, an Israeli public television channel was to begin broadcasting instructional videos Tuesday on how to prepare a sealed room and how to put on gas masks. Gas mask distribution centers were to be open for extended hours on Wednesday and Thursday. Israel’s fuel, electricity and water authorities said they were prepared to go on emergency footing, and a situation room was being opened in the infrastructure ministry in Jerusalem. Despite the heightened civil defense preparations, Education Minister Limor Livnat said after consultations with Mofaz that schools would be open as normal on Thursday, following the Purim holiday. Livnat said the decision was subject to change depending on the security situation. British Airways announced Tuesday that it would halt all flights to Israel as of Wednesday night, until further notice. The airline said the decision was in line with a revised travel advisory the British Foreign Council issued Monday, urging British citizens in Israel and the Palestinian territories to leave the region immediately. The army announcement to prepare sealed room did not appear to trigger a rush to buy supplies or change gas mask kits. Gas mask distribution centers have reported increased activity throughout the Iraqi crisis. The head of the Home Front Command said some 92 percent of Israelis already had refreshed their gas mask kits, Army Radio reported. There also were no reports of runs on supplies at stores, though the Consumer Council did receive some complaints of alleged price-gauging on sealed-room supplies. On Monday, before the army order to prepare sealed rooms, shoppers from Ramat Gan, which was hit by Iraqi missiles in 1991, were divided over whether to prepare sealed rooms. As some shoppers loaded nylon sheeting and special protection kits for pets into their carts, one woman said she was not making any specific preparations. “After the last war, some said the plastic and tape wouldn’t have helped us anyway,” she told Israel’s Channel 2 television. “So what’s different now?”

News article:
Israeli officials regard the 15-point program adopted yesterday day in Cairo by the Palestine National Council as confirmation that the policy of no contacts whatsoever with the PLO is the only possible one “Even when the so-called moderates win support for their line, the terror organizations remain dominant and no dialogue can be held with them–the only meeting with them is on the battlefield,” Premier Yitzhak Rabin declared on a radio interview last night. Foreign Minister Yigal Allon reacted similarly today. He said it was mistaken to make a distinction between “moderates” and “extremists” in the PLO because the only difference is between “extremists” and “super-extremists.” The “extremists” commanded the majority at the Cairo meeting he said, adding that “If these are the resolutions adopted by the extremists, imagine what they would have been had the super-extremists won.” According to Allon, the Cairo program gives Israel additional reason to insist on a solution of the Palestinian problem in the context of a peace settlement with Jordan. Speaking at yesterday’s Cabinet meeting, the Foreign Minister said that PLO chief Yasir Arafat and his deputy, Farouk Kaddoumi, left no doubt in their speeches in Cairo that the destruction of Israel remains the ultimate goal of the PLO. the only difference between their statements and earlier ones by PLO leaders, Allon and other Israeli officials noted, was that in Cairo this time the PLO did not explicitly call for the destruction of Israel. But there was no change in the Palestinian Covenant demand for a “secular democratic state” in all of Palestine, which aounts to the same thing. VICTORY FOR ARAFAT Political analysts here said the Cairo program contains elements of a compromise between the Arafat camp and the opposition “rejection front” headed by George Habash of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. But it was a victory for Arafat who believes in projecting the appearance of moderation for public relations reasons without changing the basic aims of the PLO, they said. The moderate image will give the PLO a certain degree of maneuverability when the time for Middle East negotiations arrives and, in any case, it will enable President Anwar Sadat of Egypt to claim, when he visits the U.S. next month, that the PLO has undergone a process of moderation. The Cairo program does not reject Palestinian participation in negotiations but rejects negotiations, within the framework of Security Council Resolution 242. It states that the Palestinians will negotiate under terms of the UN General Assembly Resolution 3236 of 1974 which supports their right to a sovereign state and return to their former homes in what is now Israel. It also calls for continued military and political warfare against Israel even after a Palestinian state is established on the West Bank.

News article:
Mahmoud Al-Habbash, the religious advisor of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called on Friday for the Saudi-led alliance, which is attacking Houthi militias in Yemen, to attack the Gaza Strip, the official PA news agency Wafa has reported. “The Arab nation has to attack any illegal side in the Arab region with an iron hand,” he said during his Friday sermon in Ramallah. “It has to start from Palestine.” He insisted that the protection of legitimacy in any Arab country is the duty of all the Arab leaders. “They have to initiate attacks against outlawed people anyhow and regardless of time and place, starting from Palestine.” He insisted that what happened in Gaza when Hamas took full security control of the territory in 2007, was “a coup” and must be dealt with decisively. “People who carry out coups, must be attacked with an iron hand,” he said. In response, senior Hamas official Mahmoud Al-Zahar wrote on his Facebook page that everyone who had hoped for the Israelis to defeat Hamas is now calling for the Arabs to do it. “This, he scoffed, “is the worst kind of tyranny.” Habbash did not mention the fact that Hamas won the Palestinian election in 2006 and was thus the legitimate, democratically-elected government when this “coup” was supposed to have taken place. Nor did he mention the coup led by his friends in Egypt against President Mohamed Morsi in 2013. Morsi was Egypt’s first democratically-elected leader. A faction within Fatah, the party to which Habbash belongs, was backed by Israel and the US to stage a coup against the Hamas government in 2007. Hamas discovered the plot and took pre-emptive steps against the plotters, most of whom were expelled from the Gaza Strip. – Read more: Abbas Aide Calls for ‘Decisive Storm’ against Gaza – Middle East Monitor

Amid claims that it committed war crimes in the last Gaza conflict, Hamas' political leader Khaled Mashal has condemned what he referred to as "Israeli extremism," telling the BBC in an interview aired Wednesday that the Palestinian attacks against Israel would continue "as long as there is occupation, aggression, war and killing." Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter "We're not looking for any escalation, but we will defend ourselves," Mashal told BBC Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen in an interview from his headquarters in Qatar, adding that Hamas will be "careful to respect international humanitarian law and to target only military targets." He lamented Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's win in the recent Israeli elections, saying that "even in the eyes of Americans and Europeans, Netanyahu is the most extreme leader and the one who lives to shed blood the most. That's why we're expecting difficult times with him." Hamas leader Khaled Mashal (Photo: AFP) Netanyahu, whose Likud party won 30 seats in the Knesset, is currently working to form a government with his right-wing "natural partners." Mashal asserted it was the international community's responsibility "to put a stop to (Netanyahu's) stubbornness and Israeli extremism," saying the Palestinians have already shown they are "flexible, serious and keen to achieve a just and rightful peace." Related articles: The Hamas leader, who has always vehemently objected peace talks with Israel and rejected the two-state solution, accused "Israel with its extremist leadership" of killing "the peace process, the two-state solution and every opportunity for a political solution for the Palestinian cause."

Mashal, whose organization is defined as a terror group by Israel, Egypt, the US, and other countries, rejected Netanyahu's accusations that Hamas was a jihadist group, claiming there is "no Islamic State or al-Qaeda in Palestine" and that Palestinians caught committing terror attacks against Israelis were "lone wolves" and "isolated."

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented Monday on the Israeli Air Force (IAF) strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria, saying Israel will not allow any radical jihadist group to get a foothold on its borders. The IAF mounted two strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria between Sunday and Monday. The air force killed four Islamic State operatives Sunday after the terrorists fired mortars and artillery on Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Golani Brigade troops patrolling the Israel-Syria border. Monday’s strike targeted an Islamic State post on the southern edge of the Syrian Golan Heights. The post, an abandoned military instillation once used by the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force stationed in the buffer zone between Israel and Syria, was used by an Islamic State proxy in southern Syria to gain a foothold near the border. The IAF dropped 10 one-ton bombs on the site, leveling the facility and destroying the weapons stored there. “Over the past few days there have been several attempts to attack Israeli troops on the Israel-Syria border. We mounted a swift, forceful response and exacted a heavy price from our enemies,” Netanyahu said Monday in a weekly meeting of the Likud party. “We continue to monitor the situation closely and we will enforce the policy I have set: We will not tolerate sporadic fire, we will respond forcefully to any incident, and if need be — we will strike our enemies before they attack us. We will not allow radical Islam or any other hostile element to impose a terrorist front on us in the Golan Heights,” he said. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Speaking at a Yisrael Beiteinu party meeting, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel will respond to any provocation on its borders. “This is actually the first time when we’ve encountered an attack by an Islamic State-affiliated cell on our soldiers. We responded the way we always do—in a forceful way,” he said. “Let me be clear: We will respond to any provocation, regardless if it is from the Gaza Strip or anywhere else.” Lieberman noted that the IAF does not need to coordinate its operations with Russia, whose air force is involved in the civil war in Syria. In September 2015, Netanyahu met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, where the two leaders agreed to set up a mechanism to prevent unintended friction between the Israeli and Russian militaries in light of Russia’s growing military presence in Syria. “There’s no need to coordinate [Israel’s current operations] with anyone,” Lieberman said. “Any attack on Israeli soldiers in Israel’s sovereign territory is met with a forceful response. Once we identify the source of the fire, we respond. When we don’t identify the source, [Syrian President Bashar] Assad’s regime is the one responsible. In this case, we identified an Islamic State cell firing from a certain location, fired and destroyed their post.” An IDF Spokesperson’s Unit statement said that the Israeli strikes “aimed to prevent the terrorists from becoming a substantial threat in the area. The IDF will continue to spare no effort to defend the Israeli public while maintaining the military’s freedom of operation in Israel’s sovereign territory, and it will not hesitate to counteract terrorist organizations threatening Israel.”

News article:
By Dov Benovadia YERUSHALAYIM — In the event of another war between Hezbollah and Israel, the terror group will know exactly which places to avoid – but finding a spot that will not be targeted by the IDF is likely to be difficult. In a social media post, the IDF published its target map of south Lebanon – specific sites that would be targeted by ground troops or aerial attacks. The map was not “leaked,” but was published on the official IDF social media channel, and has been shown at the U.N. by Israeli U.N. ambassador Danny Danon. The declassified map lists over 10,000 targets that Israel says provide infrastructure, assistance, cover, protection and other resources for Hezbollah terrorists. Among the infrastructure are 85 civilian villages – where location of terror forces, the IDF said, constitutes a war crime on Hezbollah’s part – as well as thousands of underground bunkers, weapons storage facilities, rocket launchers, command posts and more. The data is based on intelligence gathered by Israel since the Second Lebanon War, the IDF said. The army’s purpose in publicizing the map is not to show off its knowledge of Hezbollah’s capabilities, but to show how the terror group has embedded itself in the civilian life of south Lebanese villagers and farmers. In recent days, reports said that Israel has stepped up its attacks on weapons shipments from Syria to Lebanon, where Hezbollah takes possession of them. Earlier Wednesday, foreign reports said that a military base in Damascus where weapons are stored was attacked, with Hezbollah accusing Israel of carrying out the attack. Last week, Israeli planes were said to have destroyed a convoy of trucks headed from Damascus to Beirut, also presumably carrying weapons from Syria to Lebanon for the benefit of Hezbollah. The IDF had no comment on either attack.

News article:
Israel is working hard to keep chemical weapons out of the hands of the Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman told a Knesset committee Thursday. Israel does not usually acknowledge foreign military actions, but Liberman told European diplomats Wednesday—the same day that the Mazzeh military airport near Damascus was reportedly hit by surface-to-surface missiles, and a week after two strikes elsewhere in Syria—that that his country was taking action to keep Hezbollah from acquiring “advanced weapons, military equipment and weapons of mass destruction.” His latest comments to the Knesset seemed to suggest that at least one of the strikes was in order to stop Hezbollah from acquiring chemical weapons. “Our policies and our positions are very clear and are based on three red lines: We won’t allow any harm to the citizens of the State of Israel, we won’t allow any harm to the sovereignty of the State of Israel, and we will not allow the smuggling of high-quality advanced weapons and chemical weapons from Syria to Lebanon for Hezbollah,” Liberman told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Liberman added that Israel has no interest in immersing itself in Syria’s civil war, but the country would enforce its “red lines” as necessary “without considerations for any other circumstances or limitations.” Israeli leaders have made it clear in public statements and conversations with foreign leaders that they will act to prevent Hezbollah from acquiring “game-changing” weapons or strengthening its positions on Israel’s borders. Hezbollah reportedly has an arsenal of 130,000 rockets, more than the combined total of all 27 non-U.S. NATO member states. According to a July report published by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Israeli officials believe that any future war with Hezbollah has the potential to cause “thousands of civilian deaths” in Israel. Hezbollah has, among other things, threatened to attack ammonium tanks in Haifa, which could kill tens of thousands of people. The think tank’s vice president for research, Jonathan Schanzer, explained that Hezbollah’s widely-reported tactic of hiding military assets in civilian areas would also lead to mass casualties. Reports emerged two years ago that Hezbollah was offering reduced-price housing to Shi’ite families who allowed the terrorist group to store rocket launchers in their homes. An Israeli defense official told The New York Times in May 2015 that the buildup of Hezbollah’s terror infrastructure in southern Lebanese villages meant that “civilians are living in a military compound” and that their lives were at risk. A few days later, a newspaper linked to Hezbollah bolstered the Israeli assessment. Earlier this week, the IDF declassified a map showing that Hezbollah had hidden thousands of military assets in civilian areas in Lebanese areas bordering northern Israel.

News article:
Israel’s defense minister has broken Tel Aviv’s secrecy over its policy on Syria, stating it is working to prevent weapons of mass destruction from reaching Hezbollah. It came hours after a rocket attack on a Damascus air base was blamed on Israel. Speaking to ambassadors from the European Union on Wednesday, Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman said that Israel is “working, first and foremost, to defend the safety of our citizens and to protect our sovereignty, and we are trying to prevent the smuggling of advanced weapons, military equipment and weapons of mass destruction from Syria to Hezbollah,” The Times of Israel reported. The defense minister’s office refused to elaborate on the type of weapons of mass destruction Hezbollah may be trying to obtain. Liberman went on to reiterate that Israel is not interested in getting involved in the Syrian civil war, but will work to defend itself. The defense minister’s comments followed a Wednesday attack on an airbase in Damascus, Syria, which was blamed on Israel. Although that attack has not been confirmed or denied by Tel Aviv, Liberman did speak of “what was done in Syria” when referring to efforts to protect the citizens of Israel, according to a statement from his office. Last week, Israel was also accused of striking a weapons site near Damascus and a Hezbollah convoy, causing large explosions, but no casualties. Israel does not usually admit to carrying out attacks deep inside Syria, although it has publicly maintained that it will not allow advanced weapons to be transferred to Hezbollah. Speaking of the possibility of an end to Syria’s civil war which has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions, Liberman said: “When I am asked, time after time, what a possible future agreement with Syria will be like, I say that my position is that regardless of what agreement will be in Syria — the Iranians and [Syrian President Bashar] Assad have to be out of Syria and not be a part of any deal.” Liberman also took the opportunity to scold European leaders for their claims that Israeli settlements are the “biggest problem in the world,” citing deadlier world conflicts. “At least five hundred people are killed each day in the Middle East, from South Sudan to Iraq, which is much more serious and important than what is happening in Amona, but this is something you don’t see in the European press… I’m waiting for you to start talking about North Korea and the Iranians’ ballistic missiles," he said, dismissing the possibility of a peace agreement with the Palestinians anytime soon.

News article:
A map of southern Lebanon released this week by the Israeli military that ostensibly showed Hezbollah positions, infrastructure and armaments along a section of the Israeli border was a fabrication, the army admitted Thursday. The map, tweeted by the army Tuesday, appeared to feature over 200 towns and villages, which the IDF said the organization had turned into its operations bases, along with over 10,000 potential targets for Israeli strikes in the event of a new war with the terror group. “This is a war crime,” the army asserted in its tweet. A caption on the photo claimed that it had been “declassified,” in what was construed as an IDF attempt to build a case for future military action, and a warning to the terror group itself, demonstrating Israel’s superior intelligence-gathering capabilities. But on Thursday, based on an analysis by Twitter user JudgeDan48, it emerged that the map had in fact been prepared by the IDF spokesperson’s desk. The ostensible demarcations of Hezbollah positions were in fact patterns of dots, positioned on the map of southern Lebanon.

Advertisement This is a war crime. pic.twitter.com/CPE3XS1Xs0 — Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) December 6, 2016 According to a Channel 2 report Tuesday, the illustrative map has been shown to practically every foreign diplomat visiting Israel, to demonstrate that while Hezbollah may be heavily embroiled in the Syrian civil war, it continues to arm for conflict with Israel, while embedding itself ever deeper in the civilian population near the border. Hezbollah has accused Israel of attacking its installations with airstrikes twice in the last two weeks. While Israel hasn’t confirmed its involvement, Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman said Thursday that the military has been working to keep chemical weapons out of Hezbollah’s hands. Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.

News article:
Israel is working to keep chemical weapons out of Hezbollah’s hands, Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman said Thursday, clarifying comments a day earlier that hinted the terror group was attempting to obtain mass-casualty arms. In a conversation with the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Liberman again seemed to confirm that Israeli forces had been behind two recent strikes inside Syria that had been blamed on the Jewish State. The defense minister again insisted that Israel has “absolutely no interest” in getting involved in the Syrian civil war, but will work to defend itself. “Our policies and our positions are very clear and are based on three red lines: We won’t allow any harm to the citizens of the State of Israel, we won’t allow any harm to the sovereignty of the State of Israel and we will not allow the smuggling of high-quality advanced weapons and chemical weapons from Syria to Lebanon for Hezbollah,” Liberman said. The comments echoed a statement he made a day earlier to ambassadors from the European Union addressing recent airstrikes in Syria.

Asked to clarify what weapons of mass destruction were being moved late Wednesday, a defense ministry spokesman said there would be no comment. In his remarks to the Knesset committee Thursday, Liberman also stressed the Jewish state’s freedom to act, saying the country “makes its decisions absolutely freely, in accordance with the policies I listed” — his “red lines” — “and without considerations for any other circumstances or limitations.” Advertisement The comments were apparently an attempt to deny the idea that the presence of the Russian military is preventing or deterring Israel from carrying out strikes in Syria. On Wednesday morning, a bombing near a Damascus military airport was blamed on Israel. “At 3:00 a.m., the Israeli enemy fired several surface-to-surface missiles from inside occupied territory,” the Syrian state news agency SANA said, citing a military source. The report said the Israeli missiles caused a large fire but no injuries or deaths. Last week, Israeli planes also reportedly struck both a weapons site near the Syrian capital and a Hezbollah convoy, causing some large explosions but also no casualties. Israel generally does not officially admit to carrying out attacks deep inside Syria, though it has publicly maintained it will not allow advanced weapons to be transferred to Hezbollah. These once regular airstrikes on Hezbollah convoys and Syrian weapons depots have slowed in recent months, with many claiming that Russia’s deployment of the long-range, advanced S-400 missile defense system in western Syria has deterred Israel from carrying out airstrikes in Syria and curbed Israel’s once unquestioned air superiority in the region. Advertisement Israeli security officials, including former defense minister Moshe Ya’alon, have dismissed such claims, but few believe that the S-400 has had no effect on Israel’s operations. A senior air force official, speaking to reporters last month, noted that the Russians’ deployment in Syria represented a “challenge” to the Israeli military, but said the country still operated as needed in the region.

News article:
Following Arab media reports that Hezbollah and Iran have pledged to Russia not to respond to attacks attributed to Israel on Syrian targets, the Lebanese terrorist organization has clarified that no such promise has been made. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The exceptional clarification, deeming such reports "incorrect and completely invented," appeared on the public relations site of Hezbollah's military wing. Strike in Syria this week X The organization's secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, is to give a televised speech on Friday night discussing the recent developments, and he may address the issue. However, it seems that the speech will focus more on the difficulties in establishing a new government in Lebanon and the impending victory of the Syrian Army, aided by Hezbollah, in Aleppo. Wednesday, after the attack, a Syrian military official accused Israel of being responsible for the strke on the Mezzeh Air Base in western Damascus, causing a series of explosions in the early hours of the morning. Explosions in Syrian airport this week "The Israeli enemy launched at 3am several surface-to-surface missiles from Lebanese territory towards western Tel Abu Al Nada. The missiles fell in the area of the Mezzeh Air Base. As a result, fires broke out at the base with no injuries," the official told SANA, the Assad regime's official news agency. Hassan Nasrallah Israeli Minister of Defense Avigdor Lieberman addressed the Syrian accusations this week, saying, "We act primarily to protect the safety of our citizens and defend our sovereignty, and we're trying to prevent the smuggling of sophisticated weapons, military equipment and weapons of mass destruction from Syria to Hezbollah." He reiterated that Israel had no intention of interfering in the civil war in Syria, but noted that "when I am asked, time and time again, what should be the nature of a possible future accord in Syria, I say and repeat that it doesn't matter what accord it reached because in any case, the Iranians and Assad cannot be part of the accord."

News article:
Armored personnel carriers provided by the United States to the Lebanese Armed Forces have been used by Hizbullah forces in Syria, a senior Israeli military official said on Wednesday. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Israel "recognized these specific APCs... as those given by the U.S. to Lebanon." Israel shared the information with the United States "a few weeks ago," the official told reporters. He did not specify how many armored personnel carriers were involved. Israel fought a devastating war with Lebanon's Hizbullah in 2006 and closely monitors the group's activities. The Lebanese group has been fighting alongside President Bashar Assad's forces in Syria's civil war. The APCs were probably handed by the Lebanese army to Hizbullah as part "of a deal," the Israeli official said, noting that the armed Lebanese group had "tightened its grip" over central Lebanese institutions. Images shared on social media in recent weeks showed Hizbullah staging a military parade in the Syrian town of Qusayr, which it retook from rebels in 2013 in its first major victory after it intervened in support of Assad's regime. Photographs of tanks, armored vehicles and anti-aircraft batteries displaying the movement's yellow flag could be seen. Washington said last month that the United States would be "gravely concerned" if military equipment it supplied to the Lebanese army ended up in Hizbullah's hands. The Lebanese army denied that the vehicles in the pictures had belonged to it. Al-Jadeed TV also quoted Hizbullah sources as saying that the vehicles were seized in south Lebanon after the disintegration of the pro-Israel South Lebanon Army militia following the Israeli army's withdrawal. According to the Israeli official, Hizbullah has "about 8,000 people in Syria," estimating that 1,700 of its fighters have been killed there since the war began in 2011. The Israeli official also accused the Lebanese army of building watchtowers on the Lebanese-Israeli border at Hizbullah's instructions and of conducting “joint patrols” with Hizbullah militants. Israel has sought to limit its involvement in the Syrian conflict, but has carried out sporadic sorties against Hizbullah inside Syria. Israel says it reserves the right to stop the group acquiring sophisticated weapons from Syria and Iran.

A senior Israeli military officer said the army believes the chaos in the Middle East has weakened the country’s enemies, creating a low probability of war involving Israel in 2017.

Washington (AFP) - The United States denied Wednesday an Israeli claim that US-supplied armored vehicles seen being operated by Hezbollah in Syria had been given to the Islamist militia by Lebanon's official army. Last month, footage emerged of Hezbollah fighters operating M113 armored personnel carriers in Syria, where the militia -- blacklisted by Washington as a terrorist organization -- is fighting in support of Bashar al-Assad's regime. On Wednesday, a senior Israeli military official speaking on condition of anonymity said Israel believes these vehicles were drawn from stocks supplied by Washington to the Lebanese Armed Forces. But, in Washington, State Department spokesman John Kirby said US officials have investigated and do not believe that Lebanon has violated its agreement not to transfer on US-supplied equipment. "When this allegation was raised in November, the Department of Defense did a structural analysis of the armored personnel carriers in question at that time and concluded that these vehicles were not from the Lebanese Armed Forces. Our assessment remains the same now," Kirby told AFP. "As we noted when this first came up, the Lebanese Armed Forces stated publicly that the vehicles depicted online were never part of their equipment roster," he added. "The LAF fully complies with end use monitoring requirements, continues to have an exemplary track record with US equipment and remains a valued partner in the fight against ISIL and other extremists," he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. - Captured APCs - The United States supplies Lebanon's official army with arms on condition they are for official use and would be obliged to review military ties if it were proved the APCs ended up in Hezbollah's hands. Pentagon spokesman Gordon Trowbridge told AFP that Hezbollah does indeed have a "small number" of M113 armored personnel carriers in its inventory. Story continues "They've had them for a number of years," Trowbridge said. "They could have come from a variety of sources because it's a relatively common vehicle in the region." Neither US spokesman said where Hezbollah's M113s might have come from if not from the Lebanese army. But last month some officials noted that Hezbollah is thought to have captured armored vehicles from the defunct South Lebanon Army, an Israeli-backed Christian militia that collapsed in 2000. Earlier, the anonymous Israeli military official had told reporters that Israeli intelligence had "recognized these specific APCs... as those given by the US to Lebanon". He said new information had been shared with the United States "a few weeks ago" but did not specify how many armored personnel carriers were involved. Israel fought a devastating war with the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah in 2006, and closely monitors the group's activities.

But last month some officials noted that Hezbollah is thought to have captured armored vehicles from the defunct South Lebanon Army, an Israeli-backed Christian militia that collapsed in 2000. Earlier, the anonymous Israeli military official had told reporters that Israeli intelligence had "recognized these specific APCs... as those given by the US to Lebanon". He said new information had been shared with the United States "a few weeks ago" but did not specify how many armored personnel carriers were involved. Israel fought a devastating war with the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah in 2006, and closely monitors the group's activities. More recently, the Iranian-funded Lebanese Shiite movement has been fighting alongside Assad's forces in Syria's civil war. - Sporadic sorties - The APCs were probably handed to Hezbollah as part of a deal with the Lebanese army, the Israeli official said, asserting that the group had "tightened its grip" over Lebanese institutions. Images shared on social media in recent weeks showed Hezbollah staging a military parade in the Syrian town of Qusayr, which it retook from rebels in 2013 in its first major victory since it intervened. Photographs of armored vehicles and anti-aircraft batteries displaying the movement's yellow flag could be seen. Washington said last month that the United States would be "gravely concerned" if military equipment it supplied to the Lebanese army ended up in Hezbollah's hands. According to the Israeli official, Hezbollah has "about 8,000 people in Syria," estimating that 1,700 of its fighters have been killed there since the war began in 2011. Watchtowers built by the Lebanese army on the Israeli border were constructed according to Hezbollah instructions and the country's military and Iran-backed Shiite militiamen conduct joint patrols, the Israeli official said. Israel has sought to limit its involvement in the Syrian conflict, but has carried out sporadic sorties against Hezbollah inside Syria. Israel says it reserves the right to stop the group acquiring sophisticated weapons from Syria and Iran and threatening the country from both its Lebanese base and positions in Syria.

News article:
One of the more iconic and sobering elements of Israeli reality were the gas masks distributed on the street or at post offices to every citizen after Saddam Hussein fired SCUD missiles at Israel during the 1991 Gulf War. They continued to be distributed until early 2014, when the Israeli government decided to end the practice in the wake of an international deal to disarm Syria of its chemical weapons stockpiles. Now, nearly three years later, the issue has resurfaced as a direct result of the Syrian civil war—in particular, the threat from both Hezbollah and the Islamic State. In August 2013, the Assad regime deployed chemical weapons against the neighborhood of Ghouta near Damascus, asphyxiating to death over a thousand civilians, including women and children. U.S. President Barak Obama threatened a military response and issued an ultimatum to the Syrian government—his notorious “red line”—only to acquiesce to Russian mediation efforts. Under the terms of the brokered deal, Syria’s chemical weapons would be shipped out of the country and destroyed by international monitors. A triumph of diplomacy, some called it at the time. But problems with the deal emerged almost immediately. Citing Israeli and Western intelligence officials, reports surfaced in April 2014 that the Assad regime was, contrary to the deal, hiding parts of its chemical weapons stockpile as a deterrent against rebel forces. This didn’t stop the U.S., in mid-2014, from proclaiming that Syria was free of chemical weapons. Tellingly, however, Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that there remained “important questions with regard to discrepancies and omissions.” These discrepancies and omissions appear to have come home to roost. In early December, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman told European ambassadors in Tel Aviv that Israel would “prevent the smuggling of advanced weapons, military equipment and weapons of mass destruction from Syria to Hezbollah.” Coming on the heels of mysterious air strikes inside Syria, not much was left to the imagination, although in accordance with longstanding policy the Israeli government refused to confirm that it was the responsible party. One day later, Lieberman doubled down on his headline-making statement, telling the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that Israel “will not allow the smuggling of high-quality advanced weapons and chemical weapons from Syria to Lebanon for Hezbollah.” The Netanyahu government has, since the start of the Syrian civil war, tried to keep the hellstorm to its northeast at arm’s length. But one exception, as Lieberman made clear, is any attempt by Hezbollah to alter the existing balance of power. “Hezbollah holding strategic weapons is a problem not just for Israel but the region and the entire Western world,” one senior Israeli military officer recently told me. “It can easily be a reason for a ‘dynamic of escalation’”—that is, war. If he were to give one piece of advice to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the officer added, it would be “keep an eye on Hezbollah if you want a stable Middle East, and if you want to achieve something in Syria.” The officer was speaking at an annual intelligence briefing for foreign journalists in a conference room high above the Israel Defense Forces’ Tel Aviv headquarters. An overview of the major milestones of 2016—as the IDF saw it—flashed on flat-screen televisions. Interspersed between Brexit, Donald Trump, and Aleppo, one ostensibly less momentous event caught the eye: the use of chemical weapons by ISIS in Iraq. While reports only surfaced this past year, by one estimate the group has deployed crude chemical weapons on the battlefields of Syria and Iraq 52 times since 2014—including, in at least one instance, against U.S. soldiers. ISIS indeed has a presence on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights bordering Israel, but not until recently has it attacked the Jewish state. That changed in late November, when fighters from the ISIS franchise in the area (usually referred to as the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade) fired on an IDF border patrol. Despite the fact that no Israeli soldiers were injured and the terrorists were killed by return fire, and despite the fact that it wasn’t, according to the senior officer, a pre-planned attack, it did mark a watershed. The event goes some way toward explaining why the use of chemical weapons in Iraq by ISIS made it into the IDF’s annual summary a few weeks later. Israel, for its part, is taking notice—and making it clear that it is taking notice. The country’s leading news website, Ynet, published an article in late December about an elite IDF engineering unit tasked, among other delicate missions, with defending Israel against the use of chemical weapons. Based on the large number of official training pictures—gas masks and all—embedded in the article, it was clear that the authorities granted Ynet special access. “The assessment by the defense establishment is that terrorist elements are trying to get their hands on unconventional weapons, abandoned in the field by the army of Syrian President Bashar Assad on the northern border,” the article stated. This was the reason for the unit’s expansion and new training program. When Israel stopped distributing gas masks to its civilians three years ago, it was viewed as a small, rare positive development in the Syrian civil war. That decision may now join the gruesome conflict’s expanding list of losses.
