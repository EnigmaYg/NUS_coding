News article:
Just as is anticipated of Rouhani’s visits to Italy and France, the Chinese visit to Tehran focused on trade deals in the wake of the lifting of US-led sanctions. But President Xi’s discussions with the Iranian leadership reportedly also touched upon political issues to such an extent that the two countries were able to announce the formulation of a “comprehensive strategic partnership.” In part, this entails an arrangement for annual visits between the foreign ministers of China and Iran, as Beijing seeks long-term benefits from the Iranian oil economy and Tehran seeks strong Eastern backers. The Diplomat indicates that the Iranians specifically view their burgeoning relationship with Beijing as a means of challenging the established partnership between the US and Iran’s main regional rival, Saudi Arabia. This perceived potential has given Xi incentive to privilege his visit to Iran, even though Beijing is ostensibly trying to balance its interests in Iran and Saudi Arabia. In light of Tehran’s eagerness, the visit reportedly resulted in the conclusion of 17 trade agreements, aimed at building the economic exchanges between the two countries to a value of 600 billion dollars over the next 10 years. These developments once again focus attention upon some international analysts’ longstanding concerns about the possible development of an “Eastern bloc” that could present a serious challenge to Western global interests and even the international oil market’s current dependence upon US currency. On Monday, Quadrangle further highlighted this threat by pointing out that at the same time China depends upon Iranian oil for its economic interests, Russia depends upon Iran for the sake of its new approach to national security. That approach specifically entails greater confrontation with the West, as evidenced by contrary Russian and US positions on the ongoing conflict in Syria. Iran’s economic agreements with China and its security collaborations with Russia raise questions about Western efforts to normalize relations with Iran. On Monday, an editorial in the Los Angeles Times emphasized that the Iranian regime has been resistant to these efforts and has maintained a strong trend of anti-Western propaganda. Indeed, SB News reported that Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had welcomed the Chinese visit by saying that Tehran never trusted the West and was prepared to reward China for the help that they had offered while sanctions were still in effect.

News article:
The boom, and its drawbacks A geostrategic master class He came, he saw, and he pocketed all the deals that matter. Chinese President Xi Jinping's tour of Southwest Asia - Saudi Arabia, Iran and Egypt - could easily be sold anywhere as your typical Chinese-style win-win.On the PR arena, Xi did a sterling job polishing China's image as a global power. Beijing scored diplomatically on all counts, obtaining several more layers of energy security (over half of China's oil come from the Persian Gulf) while expanding its export markets and trade relations overall.To make it absolutely clear, Xi issued a statement just before arriving in Tehran, confirming Beijing's support for Iran to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). That will solidify for good the key strategic partnership trio working for future Eurasia integration.Of course, this whole process revolves around One Belt, One Road - the official Chinese denomination of the larger-than-life New Silk Road vision. No other nucleus, apart from Russia-China, offers so much potential in terms of bilateral cooperation; Iran, as much as during the ancient Silk Road uniting imperial China and imperial Persia, is the ultimate hub uniting Asia with Europe.Xi's high-tech caravan stopped first in Saudi Arabia and Egypt - the Arab world. Xi's message could not be more crystal-clear:As Xi was still in Arab land, Beijing officially issued an « Arab policy paper »; a first, tracing the history of China-Arab world interaction from the ancient Silk Road up to the founding of the Sino-Arab State Cooperation Forum in 2004. And even before addressing the - fractured - Arab League in Cairo, Xi emphasized it once again; what matters for China is «win-win» cooperation all around.Translation: business, business, business. And no Chinese interference in fractured Middle East politics.A win-win for China as far as the Arab Middle East is concerned implies the pricing of key commodities in yuan - a long-term but essentially inevitable development. And Beijing is eyeing not only Saudi Arabia but the whole GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) - which happens to be a de facto financial centre for Africa, where China has a massive presence, with Eastern Africa on top of it being linked to the Maritime Silk Road.Post-sanctions Iran, already in overdrive, is all about (re)integration into large swathes of the global economy. Yet China was already in Iran even before the lifting of sanctions.Iran wants to increase its petrochemical output, by 2025, to 180 million tons. Chinese investment will be key. According to a recent report by global energy, metals, and mining research and consultancy Scottish group Wood Mackenzie, Iran may attract as much as $70 billion for its petrochemical projects.On the alternative energy front, Iran has the capacity to generate 40,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity from solar and wind resources. Chinese companies will definitely be on it.As an NPT member state, Iran will continue to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Chinese companies are already a player in the redesigning of the Arak heavy water reactor, and will be involved in producing isotopes for medical purposes and desalinating seawater.Investment in mining is also a certainty. According to the World Mining Congress (WMC), China and Iran were the 1st and 10th largest minerals producers in the world in 2013. Iran holds more than 7% of the world's proven mineral reserves, but only 20% of these have been developed. Foreigners are now allowed to operate Iranian mines for 25 years - and China will be on it.One Belt, One Road is mostly about high-speed rail. So no wonder upgrading and expanding Iran's railway network is a key plank in the Joint Statement on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between Iran and China.Of course progress along the New Silk Road(s) will face numerous pitfalls.No one yet knows the full details about the Iran-China strategic partnership; Tehran won't be content with being just a transit route for China's exports; it aims at being a key trans-Eurasian partner. China is a WTO member; Iran is not a full member yet. China is at the center of multiple trade agreements while Iran is a partner in only a few.Cooperation with the Central Asian «stans» may be quite a feat - as some, like Uzbekistan, are quite jealous of their economic practices. And a multi-vector, complex relationship between Tehran and Ankara is still a work in progress; Turkey after all physically connects Asia to Europe.Geopolitically, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei unambiguously set the tone as he met Xi. China, said the Supreme Leader, is a «trustworthy» country; the establishment of a «25-year strategic relation is completely correct and wise»; and last but not least, «...The Islamic Republic of Iran will never forget China's cooperation during the time of sanctions».The bottom line is that for Beijing, a strategic partnership with Iran is a matter of vital national security. Moreover, geostrategically, Beijing sees Iran as an essential hub, in Southwest Asia and Eurasia for that matter, counterpunching Washington's much-advertised «pivot» and US naval hegemony. That implies Beijing's full support for a powerful Iran in the arc spanning the Persian Gulf to the Caspian; all these maritime and land routes - New Silk Road-wise - are vitally important to China.There is no fulfillment of the New Silk Road vision without a comprehensive Iran-China strategic partnership. Xi and the Beijing leadership not only solidified it; in a sweeping move, they sort of upgraded what some Iranian analysts define as Khamenei's «defensive realism» theory of international relations to a de facto protection ring of China's geostrategic interests.A master class. And it's all going according to (Beijing's) plan. Next step is Iran as a full SCO member. Eurasian integration, here we come.

TEHRAN, IRAN - JANUARY 23 : Chinese President Xi Jinping (R) and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (L) shake hands during an official welcoming ceremony prior to their meeting at Saadabad Palace in Tehran, Iran on January 23, 2016. (Photo by Pool / Iranian Presidency/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) Chinese President Xi Jinping's three-country tour of the Middle East and North Africa offers yet another example of Beijing's expanding drive for increased global influence. During his first visit to the region, Xi traveled to Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Iran where he inserted his government into the mix of some of the world's most volatile regions. Advertisement That Xi chose to visit these countries for his first overseas trip of the year, a highly symbolic act that is closely watched by Chinese foreign policy observers, is not surprising given China's increased dependence on oil from the Middle East and Persian Gulf. Experts contend, though, that there was much more to the trip than the usual cash-for-resources tours that Chinese leaders often do elsewhere in Africa. In this instance, there's a lot more at stake. One Belt, One Road Both Egypt and Iran are critical pieces in China's rapidly evolving global trading strategy that aims to revive the ancient silk road that once connected Persia with China. Known commonly as One Belt, One Road initiative, China hopes to link its economy with markets in Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa through expansive new maritime routes, international rail lines and other overland connections. If successful, OBOR promises to bring billions of dollars in Chinese development funds to these countries and further integrate them into China's trading orbit. A Region in Flux Xi's visit also coincides with a series of dramatic power shifts in the region that provides a unique opportunity for Beijing to expand its influence there. Saudi Arabia's growing alienation from the United States, a once unshakable alliance, over Washington's rapprochement with Iran allowed for Xi to receive a much warmer welcome in Riyadh than he would have just a few years ago. Separately, across the Persian Gulf in Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei expressed his eagerness for building a deeper relationship with China to serve as a potential counterweight to the United States. Similarly, in Egypt, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's turbulent relationship with Washington no doubt contributed to his enthusiastic courtship of Chinese investment and development during Xi's visit. Risks Everywhere While the strategic logic of China's desire to broaden its reach in the Middle East and North Africa is obvious, the key question is whether or not Beijing is capable of successfully navigating the region's volatile, often violent politics. This is new diplomatic terrain for the Chinese and the risk of policy missteps are very high. For now, the Chinese don't bring much more to the table than money. If their people and big new investments get sucked into the sectarian conflicts that are ravaging the region, it will not be easy for China to extricate itself without suffering considerable losses -- both human and financial. Advertisement Lina Benabdallah is a China-Africa scholar at the University of Florida's Center for African Studies where she is pursuing her Ph.D. Lina's research focuses on Chinese foreign and security policy in Africa, and as a native Arabic speaker from Algeria, she also closely follows China's diplomatic activity in North Africa and the Arab world. Lina joins Eric & Cobus this week -- in the podcast above -- to discuss Xi's recent Mideast trip and what it says about the current direction of Chinese foreign policy.

News article:
As the regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran reached ever new heights with a potential escalation following Riyadh's execution of prominent Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the entrance of a new major actor to the troubled waters of Middle Eastern politics was taking place. So far, President of China Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have visited almost every region in the world in the context of their multidimensional foreign policy approach, but not the conflict-ridden Middle East. Therefore, when Xi embarked on a major diplomatic tour into the region comprising Saudi Arabia, Iran and Egypt there were plenty of remarks in global media outlets concerning the critical decision of the "Middle Kingdom" to finally come out from the sidelines and take a step forward to become a global player.Not least because the Middle East represents the most difficult regional geopolitical realm in which China's non-interference into other countries' domestic affairs policy and staunch neutrality could be maintained due to endless conflicts among regional neighbors. As a pretext to the historic visit, Xi was trying to gradually inject China into the complicated Middle Eastern political seen by inviting representatives of Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime and the opposition in Syria to Beijing to promote a peaceful resolution. He also dispatched his deputy foreign minister to Riyadh and Tehran at the peak of the crisis to mediate between the sides and to recommend calm. More importantly, Xi made a last minute alteration in his long-planned visit itinerary and decided to visit Tehran instead of the previously planned United Arab Emirates (UAE). This significantly raised the profile of his historic tour at a time when the spotlights of global investors are all focused on Iran, striving for economic opportunities in the post-sanctions era. As one of the major global importers of energy, China's main interest in Saudi Arabia and Iran is expectedly economic, based on the maintenance of cheap and reliable supply of oil. Currently, Saudi Arabia is China's biggest supplier of crude oil and bilateral trade stands around $69 billion. During Xi's visit, he and King Salman inaugurated an energy research center and opened the Yasref Oil Refinery, a major joint venture between Saudi Aramco and China's Sinopec. They also signed a memorandum of understanding for the construction of a high-energy nuclear reactor. But China's diplomatic hyperactivity in the Middle East cannot be confined to pure economic opportunism based on maintaining cordial relations with all economic partners. On the contrary, Beijing seems to have realized a diplomatic opportunity space created by the lack of interest in Middle Eastern politics on the part of U.S. President Barack Obama's administration and the fully fledged engagement of Russia in the Syrian civil war, allying itself clearly with the Shiite camp. Therefore, neither Washington nor Moscow are in a position to act as an honest broker in the tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which presented a perfect moment for China's entry onto the Middle Eastern stage as a global power. Therefore, Xi wanted to become the first global leader to visit Tehran following the lifting of international sanctions to which China has contributed. Commercially, Iran is the favorite trading partner and logistical hub for China in the region, a status that was confirmed with 17 new agreements of cooperation in the areas of energy, trade and industry and a comprehensive strategic partnership document. The plan is to raise bilateral trade to $600 billion in 10 years, and the key to that vision is China's One Belt One Road initiative, which includes ambitious rail, road and port projects, including a high-speed rail network connecting Xinjiang in western China with Tehran via Almaty, Bishkek and Ashkhabad. Iran is geo-strategically important in this vision as it stands at a crossroads at the edge of Asia before the route of the ancient Silk Road reaches Turkey and Europe. Given the deeply skeptical approach of Iran's Shiite establishment toward the U.S. and Europe despite the recent rapprochement, China's autonomous stance in the world system provides comfort for long-term collaboration. While China has long maintained a policy of non-interference in other countries' domestic politics, harmony and economic cooperation, this might be just about to go through a radical change as far as the Middle East is concerned. China is becoming a superpower and will act like one. shortlink copied

News article:
BEIRUT: Lebanese political leaders on Thursday warned of dire consequences for the country should Iran make good its supposed promise to deliver oil. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah earlier in the day said the group had asked for help from Iran and an oil tanker was set to sail “within hours” on Thursday. Nasrallah cautioned the US and Israel against making any attempts to halt a delivery he said is intended to ease an acute fuel crisis. If it goes ahead, the delivery would be a violation of US sanctions imposed on Tehran. But Nasrallah said the tanker, carrying diesel, will be followed by others and accused US authorities of “waging an economic war on Lebanon.” Saad Hariri, Lebanon's former prime minister, said “the Iranian ships will expose the Lebanese to more risks and sanctions.” He criticized Nasrallah for declaring the ships to be Lebanese territory and rejected what he described as Lebanon being treated as an Iranian province. He warned that the country could suffer a fate similar to that of heavily sanctioned Venezuela. A Coral petrol station in Beirut lays idle on August 19, 2021 amid severe fuel shortages that have brought the crisis-hit country to a halt. (AFP) Hariri also accused Iran of “obstructing the formation of a government in Lebanon,” saying “otherwise, how does it allow itself to violate the international laws by sending ships to Lebanon without the approval of the Lebanese government?” Mark Ayoub, an expert on energy affairs in Lebanon and the Middle East, told Arab News: “We still don’t know the process that is going to be adopted to get the Iranian ships to Lebanon; will the Lebanese state be a part of it and choose international sanctions, or will Hezbollah assume responsibility?” Leaked information, said to be from sources at the Energy Ministry, indicates that “no official request has been made to the ministry to obtain permission to import Iranian oil to Lebanon, by land or by sea, or for its discharge, storage and distribution.” In comments directed at Lebanese president Michel Aoun, who is an ally of Hezbollah, Samir Geagea, president of the Lebanese Forces party, asked: “Will you leave Hezbollah, which has already usurped government authorities in security, military and strategy affairs, to take over the economic decision making as well?” Samy Gemayel, the president of the Kataeb party, said: “There is no siege on Lebanon, as Nasrallah claims — but there will be soon, because of him, and he will also bring us sanctions.” Meanwhile Aoun received a phone call from Dorothy Shea, the US ambassador to Lebanon, on Thursday informing him of Washington’s decision to support Lebanon by providing Egyptian natural gas to Jordan. It will be used to generate additional electricity that can be distributed to Lebanon via Syria. Shea said her country is making “tremendous efforts” to achieve this and added that negotiations with the World Bank are continuing in an effort “to secure financing for the cost of the gas, as well as repairing, reinforcing and maintaining power lines and gas pipes.” Najat Rushdie, the UN’s deputy special coordinator for Lebanon, spoke of her “deep concern over the potential impacts of the fuel crisis on access to healthcare and water supplies for millions of people in Lebanon.” She warned: “The bad situation will only get worse unless an immediate solution is reached.” Hamad Hassan, Lebanon’s health minister and a representative of Hezbollah in the caretaker government, announced the “granting of four emergency permissions to licensed pharmaceutical companies to import medicine, to compensate for shortages.” Recent developments in Lebanon have slowed the latest attempts to form a new government. Prime Minister-designate Najib Mikati said his efforts to achieve this will continue. This came after Aoun complained that unnamed parties were seeking to delay the process and force Mikati to resign.

News article:
Hezbollah terror group chief Hassan Nasrallah said Thursday a tanker would set off from Iran “within hours” to bring desperately needed fuel supplies to Lebanon, in defiance of US sanctions. Many questions remain about how the shipment would reach its stated destination, where acute and growing fuel shortages have forced hospitals, businesses and government offices shut amid a crippling economic crisis. But the move, prohibited by US sanctions on Iran’s oil industry, could drag Lebanon into the covert naval war between Tehran and Israel. Nasrallah dared Iran’s foes to stop the shipment. “The vessel, from the moment it sails in the coming hours until it enters (Mediterranean) waters, will be considered Lebanese territory,” he said during a televised speech to mark the Shiite Muslim commemoration of Ashura. “To the Americans and Israelis, I say: it’s Lebanese territory.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms He said a first ship would bring fuel for “hospitals, manufacturers of medicine and food, as well as bakeries and private generators.” He said more vessels would follow to address shortages that have ground Lebanon to a halt. Neither the Iranian nor the Lebanese governments have confirmed the terror organization’s claim. Advertisement Nasrallah did not specify where or how the shipment would reach Lebanon and be offloaded. Lebanese energy expert Laury Haytayan said major questions hung over the shipment, including the amount to be delivered, who would pay, where the boat would dock and whether the details of the transaction had been disclosed to the Lebanese government. “It is a possibility that these tankers will go to Syria and shipments will be refined there,” Haytayan said. “But this is all prohibited by sanctions, it’s not that easy, and since Hezbollah is doing it in public, there is a lot of danger on Lebanon, we are in danger of being sanctioned, or being attacked.” ‘Dangerous’ Since February this year, Iran and Israel have been engaged in a “shadow war” in which vessels linked to each nation have come under attack in waters around the Gulf in apparent tit-for-tat exchanges. Most recently Israel blamed Iran for a July drone attack on an Israeli-linked tanker that killed two crew members. Advertisement In May, Syria accused Israel of a series of mysterious attacks on tankers delivering Iranian oil to the country. Hezbollah, designated a terrorist group by much of the West, is a major political force in Lebanon and is the only group to have kept its arsenal of weapons following the end of the country’s 1975-1990 civil war. Hezbollah now has a more powerful arsenal than the Lebanese national army. Former prime minister Saad Hariri warned Thursday that Nasrallah’s remarks could be “dangerous.” “Iranian vessels will carry additional dangers and sanctions for the Lebanese,” he said in a statement released by his office. Lebanon is grappling with an economic crisis branded by the World Bank as one of the planet’s worse since the mid-19th century. The bankrupt state can no longer afford key imports nor subsidize essential goods, leading to crippling and sometimes deadly shortages of electricity, petrol and medicines among other things. International donors have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance but have conditioned it on the creation of a cabinet capable of spearheading reforms. Advertisement But Lebanon’s bitterly divided political leaders have repeatedly failed to agree on a new government a year after the previous one resigned in the wake of a monster blast in August at Beirut port. Hariri on Thursday accused Iran of blocking the formation of a government, something Nasrallah dismissed.

News article:
Hezbollah chief Hasan Nasrallah said Thursday a tanker would set off from Iran "within hours" to bring desperately needed fuel supplies to Lebanon, in defiance of US sanctions. Many questions remain about how the shipment would reach its stated destination, where acute and growing fuel shortages have forced hospitals, businesses and government offices shut amid a crippling economic crisis. But the move, prohibited by US sanctions on Iran's oil industry, could drag Lebanon into the covert naval war between Tehran and Israel. Nasrallah dared Iran's foes to stop the shipment. "The vessel, from the moment it sails in the coming hours until it enters (Mediterranean) waters, will be considered Lebanese territory," he said during a televised speech to mark the Shiite Muslim commemoration of Ashura. "To the Americans and Israelis, I say: it's Lebanese territory." He said a first ship would bring fuel for "hospitals, manufacturers of medicine and food, as well as bakeries and private generators." He said more vessels would follow to address shortages that have ground Lebanon to a halt. Neither the Iranian nor the Lebanese governments have confirmed the paramilitary organisation's claim. Nasrallah did not specify where or how the shipment would reach Lebanon and be offloaded. Lebanese energy expert Laury Haytayan said major questions hung over the shipment, including the amount to be delivered, who would pay, where the boat would dock and whether the details of the transaction had been disclosed to the Lebanese government. "It is a possibility that these tankers will go to Syria and shipments will be refined there," Haytayan said. "But this is all prohibited by sanctions, its not that easy, and since Hezbollah is doing it in public, there is a lot of danger on Lebanon, we are in danger of being sanctioned, or being attacked." Since February this year, Iran and Israel have been engaged in a "shadow war" in which vessels linked to each nation have come under attack in waters around the Gulf in tit-for-tat exchanges. Hezbollah, designated as a terrorist group by much of the West, is a major political force in Lebanon and is the only group to have kept its arsenal of weapons following the end of the country's 1975-1990 civil war. Hezbollah now has a more powerful arsenal than the Lebanese national army. Former prime minister Saad Hariri warned Thursday that Nasrallah's remarks could be "dangerous." "Iranian vessels will carry additional dangers and sanctions for the Lebanese," he said in a statement released by his office. Lebanon is grappling with an economic crisis branded by the World Bank as one of the planet's worse since the mid-19th century. The bankrupt state can no longer afford key imports nor subsidise essential goods, leading to crippling and sometimes deadly shortages of electricity, petrol and medicines among other things. International donors have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance but have conditioned it on the creation of a cabinet capable of spearheading reforms. But Lebanon's bitterly divided political leaders have repeatedly failed to agree on a new government a year after the previous one resigned in the wake of a monster blast in August at Beirut port. Hariri on Thursday accused Iran of blocking the formation of a government, something Nasrallah dismissed.

News article:
A report by Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) says the fuel shipments sent by Tehran to help the Lebanese people, as announced earlier on Thursday by leader of the Lebanese Hezbollah movement, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, have been paid for in advance by a group of Lebanon's Shia businesspeople. “The Iranian fuel shipments which Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah mentioned today have been all purchased by a group of Shia Lebanese businesspeople, and they are considered their property from the moment of loading,” the report said on Thursday. The Twitter account of Nournews, which is close to the council, also said the Iranian fuel shipments, in contrast to speculations and rumors fomented by hostile news networks, are “neither a gift nor the Lebanese government has paid for them.” برخلاف جوسازی‌ها و شبهه‌افکنی‌های برخی افراد مغرض و شبکه‌های معاند، محموله‌های سوخت ارسالی #ایران به #لبنان که #سید_حسن_نصرالله امروز خبر آن را اعلام کرد، نه هبه است نه دولت لبنان هزینه‌اش را پرداخت کرده، بلکه تماما توسط گروهی از تجار شیعه لبنانی خریداری شده و مایملک آنهاست. — نور نیوز (@nournews_ir) August 19, 2021 It added that the powerful measures taken by Iran and Hezbollah to shatter the economic embargo imposed on the Lebanese people, has seriously angered the enemies of the axis of resistance, who want to cast doubts on this issue by distorting relevant facts. The report came hours after Nasrallah said earlier on Thursday that the first vessel carrying Iranian fuel would set sail for Lebanon within hours, warning Israel and the United States that the resistance group would regard the ships carrying Iranian fuel as part of the “Lebanese soil.” The ship would be carrying diesel since it is a top priority for the Lebanese people’s livelihoods, Nasrallah said, promising that it would be followed by other ships carrying more fuel. The Hezbollah chief had already voiced willingness on a number of occasions to import Iran’s oil to counter Lebanon’s dire fuel shortage, in case the government fails to deal with the crisis. On Sunday, he asserted that Hezbollah would “definitely” import fuel from Iran, and would do so “in broad daylight, not at night.” The small Mediterranean country has, since 2019, been paralyzed by a major financial crisis, which has cut the value of its currency by more than 90 percent, eliminated jobs, and made banks freeze accounts. Nasrallah’s Thursday comments come as tensions run high between Israel and Iran in the aftermath of an alleged attack against the Israeli-managed Mercer Street tanker off Oman in July, after which Israel, the US and Britain were quick to blame Iran and threatened a “response.” Tehran, however, rejected the accusation as “baseless” and “childish.” Following Nasrallah’s announcement on Thursday, former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri reacted to the move, saying it risked sanctions being imposed on the country. In a series of tweets, Hariri expressed dismay over Nasrallah’s recognition of the ships as the Lebanese territory and claimed the country could suffer the fate of Venezuela, which is under tough economic sanctions. Nasrallah, however, said in his Thursday remarks that Iran has refrained from interfering in Lebanese affairs, despite standing by the side of the Lebanese people throughout the years. The US ambassador to Lebanon, Dorothy Shea, also told Al Arabiya English that Lebanon didn’t need Iranian tankers, claiming that “a whole bunch” of fuel ships off the coast are waiting to unload. Back in June, Shea sparked outrage after she said Iranian fuel shipments to Beirut to make up for the severe shortage in the country was not a “viable solution” to the problem, claiming that eradicating corruption from the Lebanese energy and electricity sectors would resolve “half of the problem immediately.”

News article:
BEIRUT — The head of Hizbollah in Lebanon on Sunday promised that deliveries of Iranian fuel would arrive "in the days to come" to help solve the beleaguered country's dire shortages. For the second time in four days, Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised address that fuel shipments would leave the Islamic republic for Lebanon. Nasrallah also dismissed as "illusions" a reported US-backed initiative to ease Lebanon's energy crisis. On Sunday alone, fuel prices soared by up to 70 per cent after yet another subsidy cut, piling more pressure on people struggling to make ends meet. The cost of hydrocarbons in Lebanon has now roughly tripled in the two months since the central bank started cutting its support for imports. The latest cut, which is expected to cause knock-on price hikes on other key commodities, adds to the Mediterranean country's economic crisis, one of the world's worst since the 1850s. Fuel shortages have forced businesses and government offices to close, even threatening blackouts at hospitals. In his first televised address on Thursday, Nasrallah announced the departure "in the coming hours" of a shipload of fuel for Lebanon in defiance of US sanctions on Iran. On Sunday, Nasrallah said the first Iranian ship loaded with fuel was "at sea". "A second ship will set sail in the next few days, and it will be followed by others," he said. Hizbollah, a close ally of Iran designated as a terrorist group by much of the West, is a major political force in Lebanon but its leaders are under US sanctions. "We will continue this process as long as Lebanon needs it," Nasrallah said. "The aim is to help all Lebanese, [not just] Hizbollah supporters or the Shiites." Questions remain over how Iranian shipments of fuel could reach their destination.

News article:
Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea on Monday ridiculed Hizbullah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah’s declared plans for bringing fuel ships from Iran. “As for Sayyed Hassan’s promised ship, it is nothing but a silly little joke amid the tragedy that we are living,” Geagea said in a statement. “Why hasn’t the Iranian oil solved Assad’s problem? It is noteworthy in this regard to mention that Syria’s fuel crisis is what amplified Lebanon’s fuel crisis due to the ongoing systematic smuggling,” the LF leader noted. “My suggestion to Sayyed Hassan is for Iran to solve Syria’s fuel problem, which would instantly resolve half of Lebanon’s problem,” Geagea went on to say. Moreover, the LF leader stressed that the only solution to Lebanon’s fuel crisis would be to “liberalize the market” and that the only solution to Lebanon’s problem would be to “liberate the state from those who are currently in power.” Nasrallah had on Sunday promised that deliveries of Iranian fuel would arrive "in the days to come" to help solve the beleaguered country's dire shortages. For the second time in four days, Nasrallah said in a televised address that fuel shipments would leave the Islamic republic for Lebanon.

Questions remain over how Iranian shipments of fuel could reach their destination. Since February this year, Iran and its arch-enemy Israel have been engaged in a "shadow war" in which vessels linked to each nation have come under attack in waters around the Gulf in tit-for-tat exchanges.

Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea on Monday ridiculed Hizbullah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah’s declared plans for bringing fuel ships from Iran. “As for Sayyed Hassan’s promised ship, it is nothing but a silly little joke amid the tragedy that we are living,” Geagea said in a statement. “Why hasn’t the Iranian oil solved Assad’s problem? It is noteworthy in this regard to mention that Syria’s fuel crisis is what amplified Lebanon’s fuel crisis due to the ongoing systematic smuggling,” the LF leader noted. “My suggestion to Sayyed Hassan is for Iran to solve Syria’s fuel problem, which would instantly resolve half of Lebanon’s problem,” Geagea went on to say. Moreover, the LF leader stressed that the only solution to Lebanon’s fuel crisis would be to “liberalize the market” and that the only solution to Lebanon’s problem would be to “liberate the state from those who are currently in power.” Nasrallah had on Sunday promised that deliveries of Iranian fuel would arrive "in the days to come" to help solve the beleaguered country's dire shortages. For the second time in four days, Nasrallah said in a televised address that fuel shipments would leave the Islamic republic for Lebanon. On Sunday alone, fuel prices soared by up to 70 percent after yet another subsidy cut, piling more pressure on people struggling to make ends meet. The cost of hydrocarbons in Lebanon has now roughly tripled in the two months since the central bank started cutting its support for imports. The latest cut, which is expected to cause knock-on price hikes on other key commodities, adds to the Mediterranean country's economic crisis, one of the world's worst since the 1850s. Fuel shortages have forced businesses and government offices to close, even threatening blackouts at hospitals. In his first televised address on Thursday, Nasrallah announced the departure "in the coming hours" of a shipload of fuel for Lebanon in defiance of U.S. sanctions on Iran. On Sunday, Nasrallah said the first Iranian ship loaded with fuel was "at sea." "A second ship will set sail in the next few days, and it will be followed by others," he said. Hizbullah, a close ally of Iran designated as a "terrorist" group by much of the West, is a major political force in Lebanon but its leaders are under U.S. sanctions. "We will continue this process as long as Lebanon needs it," Nasrallah said. "The aim is to help all Lebanese, (not just) Hizbullah supporters or the Shiites," he added. Questions remain over how Iranian shipments of fuel could reach their destination. Since February this year, Iran and its arch-enemy Israel have been engaged in a "shadow war" in which vessels linked to each nation have come under attack in waters around the Gulf in tit-for-tat exchanges.

News article:
A Lebanese lawmaker has broken ranks with his staunchly pro-American political party, thanking Iran for dispatching much-needed fuel shipments to the Arab country, which is grappling with a severe energy crisis, upon a request by the Hezbollah resistance movement. In a recent interview to Al-Mayadeen, Cesar Maalouf, a member of parliament for the Lebanese Forces, chaired by senior Christian figure Samir Geagea, extended his gratitude to the “brotherly country” of Iran for “helping the Lebanese people” at a time when other countries have abandoned them. “If our allies have sold us out and abandoned us, and are unable to help Lebanon, and a brotherly country named Iran wanted to help the Lebanese people — not only the Shias but all the Lebanese people — (by selling us fuel) at low prices and in exchange for the Lebanese Lira, should I thank this country or insult it,” said the Christian parliamentarian. “Of course I should thank it.” The Geagea-led party has traditionally maintained a pro-US and anti-Iran and anti-Hezbollah stance. The party that now holds 15 out of 64 Christian seats in the Lebanese parliament was previously a militia group that emerged from the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990). “I did not ask for the Iranian fuel. I have just thanked Iran for standing with Lebanon,” the 43-year old lawmaker asserted. “At the same time, I asked the brotherly Arab states (in the past) —notably Saudi Arabia — (to help Lebanon),” he added. “We are all going hungry. We are all being humiliated today. If you have a problem with Hezbollah and its weapons, put this problem aside. We are not talking politics right now. We are talking about the moral thing to do, the human thing to do. It is unacceptable that the Lebanese people get humiliated more than this at the petrol stations. We have fifty martyrs,” Maalouf said. On Sunday Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the first vessel shipping Iranian fuel to Lebanon had sailed. Earlier, he had warned the US and the Israel that the resistance movement would regard the vessels carrying Iranian fuel to Lebanon as Lebanese territory. Hezbollah chief had on many occasions spoken about importing Iran’s oil to mitigate Lebanon’s dire fuel shortage, in case the government failed to deal with the crippling crisis. ‘Too little, too late’ Maalouf, during the interview with Al-Mayadeen, also ridiculed and rejected an offer by the US envoy in Lebanon, Dorothy Shea, to supply energy-starved Lebanon with electricity via alternative routes involving Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. He called the offer “too little, too late”, which he said reflects the popular opinion in Lebanon that the US deliberately seeks to punish them and turn the tide against the Hezbollah resistance movement. “First of all, I tell her (the US envoy) that this is too late. She should have supported Lebanon way before that. Lebanon has been sinking for a while. Lebanon has been sinking since the ‘October 17 revolution’ (in 2019). The Total (oil) Company was carrying out prospective studies for oil in Block No. 4. Who gave Total the order to stop and leave Lebanon under the pretext that there is no gas in Lebanon’s (territorial waters)? Who told (the US ambassador) that there is no gas in Lebanon? How is there gas in Cyprus, in Syria and in Turkey, but there is no gas in Lebanon,” the Lebanese lawmaker asserted. He slammed the Americans for “putting pressure” on Lebanon and imposing sanctions to “make us starve, to humiliate us, and make us kneel down.” On the possibility of Lebanon importing medicine from Iran, he said he would welcome it. “If they want to send medicine from Iran to Lebanon, they are not telling the Lebanese people that this will be the only (products of) medicine (in the country). Whoever wants to buy Iranian medicine, let them buy it; and whoever does not want to, then they are free not to,” Maalouf said. “If the price of the Iranian medicine is one dollar and the price of the European medicine is 30 dollars, and people do not have much money left, they will buy Iranian medicine. They will be buying it willingly; no one will be forcing them to. Even the diesel that will come from Iran. Whoever likes to buy it at a lower price to use it can do so, and whoever does not want to can buy American fuel! No one will prevent them from doing so,” he hastened to add. ‘Stoking chaos and civil war’ Maalouf, in response to a question whether the crisis in Lebanon was engineered to drag the country toward the economic crisis, said the country has “many enemies.” “Whoever helps Lebanon is the friend, and whoever does not is the enemy. Let the Lebanese people be the judge in the matter. To some of those on Twitter who attacked me and said that I am jumping ship (i.e. changing political sides and allegiances), I do not jump ship. My position is clear. I am independent. I am a strong patriot,” he asserted, denouncing the online tirade against him. On why his stance is different from that of his party, the Lebanese Forces member said he deems his people’s pain more important than his own political future. “My future is not (to secure) a parliamentary seat. I am not a beggar for anyone’s parliamentary seat. My future is not to see my children being humiliated, or not being able to learn. It is not to see them applying for visas to emigrate from Lebanon. My future is the future of Lebanon’s generations. My future is not to become a (Lebanese) MP. This seat has no value for me. It does not change anything. Human dignity is the most important thing for me,” he said.

News article:
A ship for oil derivatives is headed to Lebanon from Iran, but its arrival in Lebanon will go beyond improving the conditions of the Lebanese. It will be the first ship to ever break the fuel blockade and will establish a new deterrence equation at sea this time. Lebanon's enemies are aware of its urgent need for energy. They stand behind a large part of its crisis, whether through sieges and sanctions, or through obstruction and obstacles to solutions, by proxy. The Lebanese crisis is no longer tolerable or bearable. When hospitals in Lebanon stop working due to the loss of electricity, and the lives of the Lebanese are at risk, and when a number of them die while in queues in front of gas stations, and when bakeries operate at minimum capacity, intervention to help becomes a national duty, even a moral imperative. This is exactly what Hezbollah did. It became necessary for the US to make Hezbollah pay the price of the strategic role it played in preventing the fall of Syria, and striking the strategic structure of the takfiri groups in Iraq. Added to that, Hezbollahs extended hand to the Yemenis who are facing a colonial legacy that is more than a hundred years old. Above all, Hezbollahs role in uniting the resistance forces in Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Today, the Americans, along with France, Britain and Germany, in cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, are using their old Lebanese tricks (political parties, feudal leaders, religious leaders, and academic institutions), And the new ones (civil activism institutions and NGOs), in an effort to attain one goal: implementing the strategy of tension with maximum pressure against Hezbollah.

News article:
A senior official from the Hezbollah resistance movement says shipments of fuel from Iran to Lebanon in order to help ease the country’s energy crisis will thwart all plots that the United States has crafted in this regard. The vice president of the executive council of Hezbollah, Sheikh Ali Da'moush, said on Friday that his group is utilizing all means at its disposal to address livelihood challenges facing the Lebanese people and alleviate their suffering, stressing that the decision to import fuel from Iran is aimed at tackling the fuel supply crisis. “Hezbollah's decision to import diesel and gasoline from Iran was not politically-motivated, and does not fall within the context of political or factional bickering. It was rather a decision taken on humanitarian and moral grounds,” Sheikh Da’moush said. He said, “Hezbollah can never accept the siege and starvation of the Lebanese nation. The resistance movement cannot remain indifferent in the face of the country’s collapse and humiliation of the entire nation.” “The decision would of course have political repercussions, as it has basically broken the siege that the US has imposed on Lebanese people, and foiled all its attempts to starve and humiliate the nation,” he added. Sheikh Da’moush went on to say that the Lebanese nation is paying a heavy price for delayed government formation. He said it is in the country’s best interests that political parties set aside their own preferences and seek quick solutions to existing obstacles. “Hezbollah has long been helping the process of government formation, and offered its firm support for the matter to realize,” he noted. Hezbollah head Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has said a third shipment of Iranian fuel has been agreed to ease crippling shortages in Lebanon. “We have agreed to start loading a third vessel,” Nasrallah said in a televised speech on Friday. “The coming days will prove those doubtful about the shipments arriving with fuel wrong … and our words will be clear when the first vessel reaches Lebanon.” On Sunday, Nasrallah said the first vessel carrying Iranian fuel for Lebanon had already departed. Oil monitor TankerTrackers.com said an oil tankers had left Iranian waters on Thursday, while another was due to depart on Friday morning. “The tanker that is laden with fuel for the power grid has departed today while the other one that is loading gasoline is anticipated to depart first thing tomorrow,” tweeted the monitor on Thursday, but later said the second one will likely depart on Saturday. It added that the first tanker left port last week, but had only left Iranian waters on Thursday, due to a “very long coastline” and “departure protocols.”

It was rather a decision taken on humanitarian and moral grounds,” Sheikh Da’moush said. He said, “Hezbollah can never accept the siege and starvation of the Lebanese nation. The resistance movement cannot remain indifferent in the face of the country’s collapse and humiliation of the entire nation.” “The decision would of course have political repercussions, as it has basically broken the siege that the US has imposed on Lebanese people, and foiled all its attempts to starve and humiliate the nation,” he added. Sheikh Da’moush went on to say that the Lebanese nation is paying a heavy price for delayed government formation. He said it is in the country’s best interests that political parties set aside their own preferences and seek quick solutions to existing obstacles. “Hezbollah has long been helping the process of government formation, and offered its firm support for the matter to realize,” he noted. Hezbollah head Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has said a third shipment of Iranian fuel has been agreed to ease crippling shortages in Lebanon. “We have agreed to start loading a third vessel,” Nasrallah said in a televised speech on Friday. “The coming days will prove those doubtful about the shipments arriving with fuel wrong … and our words will be clear when the first vessel reaches Lebanon.” On Sunday, Nasrallah said the first vessel carrying Iranian fuel for Lebanon had already departed. Oil monitor TankerTrackers.com said an oil tankers had left Iranian waters on Thursday, while another was due to depart on Friday morning. “The tanker that is laden with fuel for the power grid has departed today while the other one that is loading gasoline is anticipated to depart first thing tomorrow,” tweeted the monitor on Thursday, but later said the second one will likely depart on Saturday. It added that the first tanker left port last week, but had only left Iranian waters on Thursday, due to a “very long coastline” and “departure protocols.”

News article:
Secretary-General of the Lebanese Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah revealed on Friday an agreement with Iran to start loading a third ship of oil derivatives to sail to Lebanon. This came in a televised speech delivered by Nasrallah on the fourth anniversary of the Second Liberation, which was broadcast by some Lebanese channels, including pro-Hezbollah Al-Manar TV channel. Nasrallah stated: We agreed with the Iranians to start loading a third ship of oil derivatives to head towards Lebanon. We need more than three ships to face the next stage. On 19 August, Nasrallah confirmed that an Iranian fuel ship was on its way to his country, and then on 22 August, he announced that a second oil vessel would sail to Lebanon within days, and other ships would follow. Read: Lebanon heading towards collapse, Sunni sheikh warns So far, the Lebanese side did not announce the arrival of any ship coming from Iran, and the government has issued no official comment about the Iranian oil shipments, the location to unload the cargo or who would benefit from it. Lebanon has been suffering a severe fuel shortage for more than two months due to the lack of sufficient foreign exchange to import it. In his speech, Nasrallah stressed the importance of: "Forming a government as soon as possible in order to start reaching solutions to the ongoing crises." On 26 July, President Michel Aoun commissioned Najib Mikati to form a new government to succeed the caretaker government, which resigned six days after the explosion of the Beirut Port on 4 August, 2020. Consultations are still ongoing between the concerned parties to agree on a government formation. Read: Lebanon water supply cuts as fuel shortage continues

News article:
Iran’s first fuel tanker that set sail two weeks ago is en route to Lebanon as a second ship also begins its journey to assuage the sufferings endured by the Lebanese people under severe fuel shortages and American sanctions. Data from TankerTrackers, a global tanker tracking website, showed that the first ship is sailing toward Lebanon. 2021-08-28 update regarding Iranian fuel for Lebanon: - We received an acknowledgement signal from Iran for the first tanker we identified. This vessel is underway with fuel for the electric power grid. - Gasoline tanker hasn't departed yet. - Investigating 3rd tanker. /TT pic.twitter.com/FQ7pwybbqG — TankerTrackers.com, Inc. (@TankerTrackers) August 28, 2021 2021-08-29; second update regarding Iranian fuel for Lebanon: The second tanker has departed port and is currently underway. We should know by morning if she’s left the country as well. It’s a process, people. /TT — TankerTrackers.com, Inc. (@TankerTrackers) August 29, 2021 Citing informed sources, Lebanon’s al-Manar television network also confirmed the report. Meanwhile, Hebrew sources said that Lebanon’s resistance movement Hezbollah is at a state of alert in case the Israeli regime makes a miscalculation with regard to the ship. On August 19, Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah warned the US and Israel that the vessels carrying Iranian fuel would be regarded as “Lebanese territory,” as he announced the departure of the first ship from Iran. Earlier today, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh cautioned against any move targeting the tankers, saying that neither the US nor any other country is in a position to stop legitimate trade between Iran and Lebanon. “We are very serious about exercising our sovereignty and everyone should know that legitimate trade in this sphere is one of the basic principles of international law,” Khatibzadeh said during a virtual press conference. Fuel shortages in Lebanon have forced businesses and government offices to close, threatening to cause blackouts at hospitals and halt transportation and other vital sectors in the Arab country. The plan to send Iranian fuel to Lebanon is seen as a watershed in breaking US sanctions, which have targeted both countries. Just a few hours after Nasrallah’s August 19 announcement, US Ambassador to Lebanon Dorothy Shea claimed that Washington would help Lebanon implement a plan to transfer Egyptian gas to Lebanon for power generation. The Hezbollah leader later derided Shea’s plan as an act of “selling illusions to the Lebanese,” saying even if implemented, it could take a year to import gas from Egypt to Lebanon. In remarks on Friday, Nasrallah announced that a deal was reached with Tehran to import a third fuel-loaded tanker to ease crippling shortages in the country. “The coming days will prove those doubtful about the shipments arriving with fuel wrong ... and our words will be clear when the first vessel reaches Lebanon,” he said in a televised speech. He also said the country’s economic crisis was the result of an economic siege imposed by the US, stressing that the so-called Caesar sanctions by Washington on Syria had also harmed Lebanon. “Go ahead and give Lebanon an exemption for Iranian gasoline and diesel ... go ahead and give Lebanon an exemption from Caesar,” Nasrallah said, addressing Washington in his speech.

An Iranian fuel tanker is about to reach Lebanon and has become near the entrance of the Suez Canal, the Iranian Mehr news agency has reported. And while neither Iran nor Hizbullah have officially confirmed the news, Hizbullah’s al-Manar TV quoted sources as saying that the tanker has become in the Mediterranean. TankerTrackers, a global tanker tracking website, meanwhile showed that a second fuel tanker had left an Iranian port on Sunday for a yet to be identified destination while noting that a third tanker is being loaded with gasoline. Hizbullah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah had warned Israel and the U.S. against targeting the ships while noting that the vessels are not enough to resolve Lebanon’s fuel shortage problem. Fuel shortages have forced businesses and government offices to close, even threatening blackouts at hospitals. "We will continue this process as long as Lebanon needs it," Nasrallah said. "The aim is to help all Lebanese, (not just) Hizbullah supporters or the Shiites." Questions remain over how Iranian shipments of fuel could reach their destination. Since February this year, Iran and its arch-enemy Israel have been engaged in a "shadow war" in which vessels linked to each nation have come under attack in waters around the Gulf in tit-for-tat exchanges.

News article:
The US is in no position to block Iran’s legitimate trade with other countries, says Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh, referring to Iranian fuel shipments to Lebanon as the Mediterranean country suffers from ongoing shortages amid American sanctions. “The US is not in a position to block legitimate trade. We are very serious about exercising our sovereignty and everyone should know that legitimate trade in this sphere is one of the basic principles of international law,” Khatibzadeh said during a virtual press conference on Monday. Two weeks ago, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of Lebanon’s Hezbollah resistance, announced that a ship carrying Iranian fuel was about to set sail for Lebanon, warning that the vessel and the tankers subsequently carrying Iranian fuel would be regarded as “Lebanese territory”. Just a few hours after Nasrallah’s announcement, US Ambassador to Lebanon Dorothy Shea claimed that the Biden administration would help Lebanon get Egyptian gas. The Hezbollah leader later said the first tanker was already on its way to Lebanon, promising that more ships would follow despite US opposition, and deriding Shea’s plan as an act of “selling illusions to the Lebanese.” During his press conference last week, Khatibzadeh voiced Iran’s readiness to sell fuel to the Lebanese government in addition to the country's businessmen. The sales will continue as long as Iran has a customer in Lebanon and there is demand for fuel there, he said. Making a reference to plans to provide Lebanon with fuel from other countries, the Iranian spokesman said other producers should not hesitate if they can alleviate the suffering of the Lebanese people. “Neither the US nor any other country is above law to stop the legitimate trade” between Iran and Lebanon, he reiterated, adding that the sale is a decision made by the Iranian establishment. Fuel shortages have hit factories and businesses across Lebanon, threatening to halt transportation and other vital sectors in the Arab country, which is already struggling with its worst economic crisis. The plan to send Iranian fuel to Lebanon is seen as a watershed in breaking US sanctions, which have targeted both countries. Khatibzadeh said the Lebanese are an affluent people and do not need donations from others, adding "some countries should stop politicizing the issues and allow the Lebanese people to meet their needs". ‘Tehran never withheld friendly hand from Riyadh’ Elsewhere during his presser, Khatibzadeh was asked whether negotiations between Tehran and Riyadh held in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, had reached an impasse, to which he responded in the negative and explained that “there is no deadlock that cannot be broken between the two great countries.” “It only requires political will and action in both capitals,” he said. “Saudi Arabia is our neighbor in this region. [Iran] and Saudi Arabia have a lot in common for [achieving] peace and stability in the region. Iran has never withheld its friendly hand from Riyadh,” he added. The spokesman further said whenever Riyadh showed a willingness to act on the basis of the established regional mechanism, Iran welcomed it. Baghdad has been hosting talks between the two regional heavyweights in recent months on mending ties severed in 2016. Late in April, Tehran welcomed “a change in Saudi Arabia’s tone” towards the Islamic Republic, as observed in Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s earlier interview, during which he said he wanted to have a “good and distinguished relationship” with Iran, striking a different note from Riyadh’s usual demonization of Tehran. Iran’s new President Ebrahim Raeisi has made dialogue with neighbors one of his administration’s priorities and said Tehran believes that there is no obstacle to reopening embassies in Tehran and Riyadh. On Saturday, Iraq hosted the Baghdad International Conference “For Cooperation and Participation” with the objective of easing tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Khatibzadeh thanked Iraq’s constructive role, noting that three rounds of talks have been held between Riyadh and Tehran, which could continue if needed. He also said no new talks were held between Iran and Saudi Arabia on the sidelines of the Saturday conference attended by both sides’ foreign ministers.

An Iranian ship loaded with diesel for Lebanon has entered Syria's territorial waters, Iran's semi-official news agency Fars said Thursday. Two weeks ago Hizbullah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said that an Iranian fuel tanker had sailed toward Lebanon, and that others would follow to help ease the fuel shortages. "The issue of the Lebanon-bound Iranian fuel ship is a security matter,” Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said yesterday, Wednesday. He added that “Lebanon has turned from a state containing a terrorist organization into a state ruled by a terrorist organization,” referring to Hizbullah. The delivery, organized by Hizbullah, would violate U.S. sanctions imposed on Tehran after former President Donald Trump pulled America out of a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers in 2018.

Informed sources said that choosing Syria for the ship docking “has nothing to do with fears of an attack from Israel or the U.S.” but rather for internal considerations and “the unwillingness to implicate any allies.” On the other hand, the sources indicated that “the shipment will reach a Syrian port and the fuel will be transported by trucks to Lebanon,” stressing that “the priority of distribution will be to hospitals.” On a separate note, Arab Tawhid Party leader Wiam Wahhab told al-Jadeed TV that the Iranian ship is soon to arrive to Banias – a Syrian city in Tartous Governorate. He said that “in a few days, the fuel will start arriving in Lebanon,” adding that “the warehouses have been chosen.” “The market will soon be relieved,” Wahhab assured.

News article:
Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian says Tehran is ready to sell more fuel to the Lebanese government and businessmen if need be, as an Iranian ship transporting fuel for the crisis-hit country has entered Syria’s territorial waters. In a Friday phone call with Gebran Bassil, the former Lebanese minister of foreign affairs and leader of the Free Patriotic Movement, Amir-Abdollahian said Iran sets no limitation to the expansion of mutual relations with Lebanon and is ready to sell more fuel production to “new customers.” “The strategy adopted by the esteemed leader of Hezbollah to end this Zionist-made crisis against the Lebanese people confirms the fact that the path to Lebanon's honor depends only on self-reliance and the use of its assets and resources,” he said. The top diplomat emphasized Iran's unwavering support for Lebanon's government, army and the resistance movement. The first ship containing Iranian fuel reportedly entered Syria’s territorial waters on Thursday to unload its cargo, which will be then transferred to Lebanon via tankers. Informed sources said that two other Iranian ships will also deliver their cargo to Lebanon through the same mechanism. Fuel shortages in Lebanon have forced businesses and government offices to close, threatening to cause blackouts at hospitals and halt transportation and other vital sectors in the Arab country. The plan to buy Iranian fuel, announced by Secretary General of Lebanon’s Hezbollah resistance movement Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on August 19, is seen as a watershed in the US sanctions, which have severely affected Lebanon and Iran alike. In his announcement, the Hezbollah chief warned the US and Israel that Hezbollah would consider the tanker and next Iranian ships as “Lebanese territory” from the moment they sail. He later stressed that the Lebanese resistance group did not have any political aspirations by importing fuel from Iran. The former Lebanese foreign minister, for his part, thanked Iran for selling and shipping fuel to Lebanon. Bassil criticized those who want to starve the Lebanese people in order to achieve their political ambitions and called for the improvement of all-out ties with Iran. He also delivered to Amir-Abdollahian a message from Lebanese President Michel Aoun to his Iranian counterpart Ebrahim Raeisi.

News article:
A member of the Lebanese parliament says the American financial, economic and political siege has started to break with the forthcoming arrival of the first Iranian ship loaded with fuel to Lebanon. “As the Lebanese are preparing to receive Iranian fuel with the arrival of the first ship, the doors of the American blockade have begun to break, and options are opened for Lebanon to alleviate the impact of its crisis, after the American administration was forced to back down from its threats and maximum pressure in the face of the will of the Lebanese people,” Hassan Fadlallah said in a statement on Saturday. He added that the US administration tried to use the siege to impose its will on Lebanon, before it came to realize the negative and reverse impacts of its failed policies. It did not take into account the facts pertaining to Lebanon until it suffered a new political defeat in the face of the declared policy that the Iranian ship is considered Lebanese territory, he added. “The cargo of this ship will be a precise bullet that will break the financial, economic and political siege imposed on our people, especially as it will reach those who need it through a transparent and publicized mechanism in which there is no place for monopolists, smugglers, policy brokers and American investment associations, who traffic in people’s pain,” Fadlallah said. Apart from providing Lebanon with its needed fuel, the official said, the shipment challenged US self-proclaimed right to decide on Lebanon’s official relations with Syria, and its prevention of Lebanon’s electricity and gas imports through Syria. “It is the veto that we have long demanded to challenge because submitting to it causes severe harm to Lebanon’s economy and national interests,” the lawmaker said. Fadlallah added that Hezbollah’s humanitarian initiative is one of the many cards of strength that the resistance possesses to defend the rights of the Lebanese people to a decent life. It also constituted an unexpected surprise for the US administration which revealed the hollow policy of intimidation with sanctions that does not work, he noted.

News article:
A Lebanese parliamentary bloc says Iran's fuel shipments to Lebanon exposed the true faces of all those who counted on benefiting from the US economic siege against Lebanon. “The news of Iranian fuel tankers sailing toward Lebanon exposed the true faces of all those who counted on benefiting from the US economic siege against Lebanon, its people and its government, with the aim of subjugating and dominating the management of the country’s affairs and control of its policies,” the Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc said in a statement. Fuel shortages in Lebanon have forced businesses and government offices to close, threatening to cause blackouts at hospitals and halt transportation and other vital sectors in the Arab country. The plan to buy Iranian fuel, announced by Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on August 19, marked a watershed in foiling the US sanctions, which have severely affected both countries. Nasrallah warned the US and Israel that Hezbollah would consider the tanker and next Iranian ships as “Lebanese territory” from the moment they sail. He later stressed that the Lebanese resistance group did not have any political aspirations by importing fuel from Iran. The first ship containing Iranian fuel entered Syria’s territorial waters last week to unload its cargo, expected to be then transferred to Lebanon via tankers. Informed sources said that two other Iranian ships will also deliver their cargo to Lebanon through the same mechanism. The Lebanese bloc said the insistence of Nasrallah on helping the Lebanese people forced the Americans to rush through measures to maintain a say in the country’s affairs. It noted that the resistance has clearly revealed to the Lebanese people the fragility of the American siege against the Mediterranean country and the so-called “Caesar Act” sanctions imposed by the US against Syria. “It has also become clear that the stifling economic crisis that the Lebanese have suffered from would not have been exacerbated had it not been for the American policy of blackmail to exploit the pain and anguish of the Lebanese in order to make them surrender and dictate its policies to them,” the bloc added. ‘Credit largely goes to Nasrallah’ Syria agreed to transport Jordan’s electricity and Egypt’s gas to Lebanon on September 4, two days after the first tanker containing Iranian fuel entered Syria’s territorial waters. According to the editor-in-chief of London-based online newspaper Rai al-Youm, by approving the request, Damascus has shown once again that it can rise above the wounded pride and petty considerations. In an editorial published on Tuesday, Abdel Bari Atwan wrote that the agreement should help alleviate Lebanon’s crippling energy crisis. “The credit is largely due to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah,” he noted. “By turning to Iran to supply oil and gas to Lebanon in defiance of the US and Israel, and pledging to protect incoming Iranian tankers from any attempted attack, he forced the US’ hand.” He argued that Iran's fuel shipment forced the United States’ “hitherto imperious” ambassador, Dorothy Shea, to back down and turn to Jordan and Egypt for alternative solutions. Just a few hours after Nasrallah’s August 19 announcement, Shea claimed that Lebanon did not need Iranian tankers, citing what she called “a whole bunch” of fuel ships off the coast waiting to unload. She also said Washington would help Lebanon implement a plan to transfer Egyptian gas to Lebanon for power generation.

News article:
Hezbollah’s secretary-general says a third and a fourth fuel-laden vessel is expected to head out of Iran towards Lebanon in the future, saying his group seeks for a part of Lebanon’s fuel needs to be met using Iranian imports. “Paperwork has been done for the dispatch of the third gasoline-laden ship from Iran. The fourth ship will bear diesel and will be sent over subsequently,” Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said during a speech on Monday. Referring to Lebanon’s new government that was formed recently at the direction of President Michel Aoun following endless indecision, he said the government would decide on any fuel shipments that could follow that. Nasrallah, however, asserted, “We want part of Lebanon’s fuel to be provided from Iranian imports.” The movement announced a decision to start importing fuel from the Islamic Republic last month amid crippling economic conditions, caused partly by the United States’ sanctions that have been targeting Lebanon over Hezbollah’s legitimate involvement in the country’s political and military sectors. ‘Some hoped Israel would target the ships’ He said some used to speculate that the promise for shipment of fuel from Iran simply served propagandist media purposes. “It, however, became finally clear that such remarks are false,” he said. Those same people were hopeful for the Israeli regime to target the vessels, the Hezbollah chief said. “[Their speculations] were proven wrong. Israel is in a tight spot and the deterrence equation is there” to dissuade it from taking any such action. By deterrence power, Nasrallah was referring to his movement’s vast arsenal of missiles, including precision ones, that the group has vowed not to hesitate to deploy to defend the country against the regime. Meanwhile, Nasrallah said the fact that the movement was distributing the fuel at a lower price that its purchase and imports have cost proved that it has not been cooperating with the fuel shipment “for commercial purposes.” “We’re not after conducting business here,” he noted. Thanking Leader, Iranian authorities The fuel deliveries were going to help Lebanon lower fuel prices countrywide, Nasrallah noted, saying the country was soon to announce a moderate prices. The Hezbollah chief expressed his and his movement’s gratitude towards Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei and other senior Iranian authorities for helping the shipments become a reality. Separately, Nasrallah thanked Lebanese authorities for helping get the country a government after successive interim ruling patterns did not last out to resolve the country’s woes. The current administration’s priority has to lie in preventing the country from disintegrating, enabling deployment of reforms, and fixing the problems that have come in the way of the people’s livelihood. Finally, the Hezbollah official addressed the daring escape of six Palestinian prisoners from an Israeli maximum-security jail. The development testified to the “Palestinian heroes’ bravery, resolve, and ingenuity,” he asserted. It was important in many aspects, the most significant among which was “a Palestinian’s insistence on freedom.”

BEIRUT (AP) — The leader of the Hezbollah terror group said Monday the first tanker carrying Iranian fuel to Lebanon has arrived in a Syrian port and the diesel will be shipped to Lebanon by tanker trucks later this week. The arrival of the tanker comes nearly a month after Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the group will start bringing fuel from Iran in an attempt to ease a crippling fuel crisis that Lebanon has been experiencing for months. The delivery, organised by the Iran-backed group, violates U.S. sanctions imposed on Tehran after former President Donald Trump pulled America out of a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers three years ago. The arrival of the Iranian tanker carrying fuel destined for Lebanon comes days after a new government was formed ending a 13-month deadlock. Lebanon’s new Prime Minister Najib Mikati has not commented on the deal to import fuel from Iran. Nasrallah said in a televised speech Monday night the group chose to have the tanker dock in a Syrian port to avoid embarrassing the Lebanese state and risking sanctions on Lebanon. Syria, also under U.S. sanctions, has been mostly relying on oil supplies from its strong ally Iran, which sent thousands of Iran-backed fighters, including Hezbollah members, to back President Bashar Assad’s forces in the 10-year conflict there. Nasrallah said the tanker arrived in the Syrian port of Banias early Sunday and the process of unloading the fuel began the same day. He added that the Syrian government has mobilized dozens of tanker trucks to transport the diesel to the eastern Lebanese town of Baalbek by Thursday. Nasrallah said three other tankers carrying diesel and one carrying gasoline will arrive in the coming weeks. He said diesel will be donated for a period of one month to institutions including public hospitals, nursing homes, orphanages, water stations and the Lebanese Red Cross. Nasrallah added that others who will get fuel at low prices are private hospitals, medicine and serum factories, bakeries and cooperatives that sell food products. Nasrallah said Hezbollah will be supplying gas stations linked to the group around the country. “We are not competing (with the state) but we want to add the flow of fuel to the market,” he said.

Nasrallah said Hezbollah will be supplying gas stations linked to the group around the country. “We are not competing (with the state) but we want to add the flow of fuel to the market,” he said.

News article:
Role in government GOVERNMENT - 2005: Hezbollah entered Lebanese politics more visibly after the killing of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon. A coalition of anti-Syrian factions took power following an election which gave Hezbollah 14 seats in the 128-seat parliament. 2006: Hezbollah and its allies quit a government led by Western-backed Prime Minister Fouad Siniora over the governing coalition’s refusal to give the opposition effective veto power. 2008: Hezbollah clashed with domestic foes and briefly seized west Beirut in the worst civil strife since the 1975-1990 civil war, after the government vowed to take action against the group’s military communications network. After mediation, rival leaders signed a deal to end 18 months of political conflict. 2011: Syria’s civil war led to years of political paralysis in Lebanon. In January, the first government of Saad Hariri was toppled when Hezbollah and its allies quit over the UN-backed tribunal set up to prosecute those behind the assassination of his father, Rafik Hariri. Six months later, Prime Minister Najib Mikati announced a government dominated by Hezbollah and its allies. 2016: Saad Hariri, who spent years abroad because of security fears, reached a deal making Hezbollah ally Michel Aoun president, and him premier. 2018: Hezbollah and its allies won a parliamentary majority. 2019: Protests broke out against a deep economic crisis. Hariri quit in October. Hezbollah and its allies backed Hassan Diab as premier. He formed a new government in January 2020. CONFLICTS: UN Security Council Resolution 1559, sponsored by the United States and France and adopted in 2004, called for all Lebanese militias to be disbanded and disarmed. Hezbollah is the only militia to keep its arms since the civil war. 2012: Hezbollah militants deployed in Syria to aid Syrian government forces. The group played a role in helping beat back the rebellion. 2006: Hezbollah crossed the border into Israel, kidnapped two Israeli soldiers and killed others, sparking a five-week war that killed 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 158 Israelis, mostly soldiers. Hezbollah waged a prolonged military campaign against Israeli forces which occupied south Lebanon until their withdrawal in 2000. HARIRI ASSASSINATION: In 2020, a UN-backed court convicted a Hezbollah member of conspiring to kill Rafik Hariri in a 2005 bombing. Hezbollah has denied any involvement in Hariri’s killing. Its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said it was not concerned with the trial and that if any members of the group were convicted, it would stand by their innocence.

News article:
Beirut: The Hezbollah militant group said it trucked more than 1 million gallons of Iranian diesel fuel into Lebanon from Syria on Thursday, celebrating the move as a way of spiting the United States while bringing much-needed aid to a country nearly paralyzed by fuel shortages. With Lebanon suffering one of the worst economic collapses in modern history, Hezbollah portrayed itself as a national savior, stepping in where the Lebanese government and its Western backers had failed. Hezbollah supporters lined roads in northeastern Lebanon as dozens of tanker trucks arrived. They waved Hezbollah flags, distributed sweets, blasted heroic anthems and fired rocket-propelled grenades into the air in celebration. The fuel delivery — which a Hezbollah official said was the first installment of more than 13 million gallons — underscored the severity of Lebanon’s crisis, as well as the government’s failure to address it. Unable to secure help from elsewhere, it has turned to war-torn Syria and economically damaged Iran. The move appeared to violate US sanctions involving the purchase of Iranian oil, but it was unclear whether the United States would press the issue. Hezbollah, considered a terrorist organization by the United States, is already subject to US sanctions. Although the group is part of Lebanon’s government, it appeared to be acting independently. The US Embassy in Beirut declined to comment Thursday. But when Hezbollah announced last month that fuel was on the way from Iran, the US ambassador played down any threat of punitive measures. “I don’t think anyone is going to fall on their sword if someone’s able to get fuel into hospitals that need it,” Ambassador Dorothy Shea told Al-Arabiya English. The fuel arrived as Lebanon struggles through what the World Bank has called one of the world’s worst economic meltdowns since the mid-1800s. Since the fall of 2019, the national currency has lost 90% of its value, and prices for many goods have tripled. Fuel shortages have caused widespread electricity cuts and left many Lebanese waiting in long lines to fill up their cars. The convoy’s arrival highlighted the near absence of the Lebanese state. The government bodies charged with overseeing energy imports were not involved with the delivery. The trucks drove from Syria into Lebanon over an open stretch of land, not via an official border crossing, with no customs or security checks. It was unclear whether the imports had any legal authorization or if any taxes would be paid on them. Lebanon’s prime minister, Najib Mikati, who formed a new Cabinet last week and has vowed to work to ease the country’s woes, made no public statement about the fuel shipment Thursday, nor did authorities overseeing the borders. “The country is facing a serious crisis, so the government couldn’t care less whether the trucks entered legally or illegally,” said Elias Farhat, a retired general in the Lebanese army. “We’re in an emergency situation.” The shipment was the first tranche of 13.2 million gallons an Iranian ship delivered to the port of Baniyas, Syria, last week, Ahmed Raya, a Hezbollah media official, said. The rest will take several days to offload and transport to Lebanon. TankerTrackers.com, a group that tracks global oil shipments, estimated that the ship carried less than 8 million gallons of fuel. The fuel crisis set off a showdown of sorts between Hezbollah and its allies and the United States over who could act faster to ease the people’s pain, a competition that Hezbollah won, at least for the day. Nearly every step of the fuel’s journey was a challenge to the United States, which has imposed sanctions on the purchase of Iranian oil, the Syrian government, Hezbollah and the Hezbollah-linked company that will distribute the fuel inside Lebanon. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said that the fuel had been paid for by unnamed Lebanese businessmen and that most of it would be donated to institutions that included government hospitals, nursing homes, orphanages, the Lebanese Red Cross and organizations involved in water distribution. Cut-rate fuel will also be sold to private hospitals, medicine factories, bakeries, supermarkets and private electricity providers, he said. Women toss rose petals as they welcome tankers carrying Iranian fuel. Image Credit: AFP “Our aim is not trade or profit,” Nasrallah said in a speech Tuesday. “Our aim is to alleviate the suffering of the people.” He also said three more Iranian ships, one carrying gasoline and two carrying diesel, were en route to Syria. Jessica Obeid, an energy policy consultant and nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute, said that 1 million gallons Hezbollah reported bringing in Thursday was not a lot relative to the country’s needs but that it could help individual institutions. A hospital generator, for example, might burn about 26 gallons per hour, she said. But stepping in where the state had failed was a political coup for Hezbollah, whose image as the nation’s defender had been tarnished by its participation in Syria’s civil war and its opposition to a grassroots protest movement that sought to end government corruption. Hezbollah has blamed the United States for Lebanon’s economic crisis, claiming that it has put Lebanon under siege. In fact, US sanctions focus overwhelmingly on Hezbollah and its allies, not the Lebanese state, whose dysfunction and corruption are at the root of the crisis. The United States is the largest donor of humanitarian aid to Lebanon, and the Biden administration announced a new $100 million aid package last month aimed at providing assistance for food, health care, security, water and sanitation. But Hezbollah portrayed the arrival of the convoy Thursday in heroic terms, saying it had “broken the American siege,” a line of thinking that many Lebanese will most likely accept.

(MENAFN- IANS) Beirut, Sep 17 (IANS) Lebanon has received tanker trucks carrying Iranian oil in a move aimed at easing energy shortages in the crisis-hit country. A vessel carrying Iranian oil docked in Syria on Sunday, and the oil was unloaded in trucks and sent by land to the Bekaa Valley on Thursday, reports Xinhua news agency. Lebanon has been suffering from shortage of US currency reserves, which deprives the country from importing its oil needs. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah announced on Monday that a second ship with fuel oil would arrive in the Syrian port of Baniyas in a few days, and Lebanon is expected to receive two more ships carrying gasoline and fuel oil. Some Lebanese anti-Hezbollah parties expressed over the past few days their concerns over the possibility of the US imposing sanctions on Lebanon after its oil imports from Iran. --IANS ksk/

A senior US Senate member has acknowledged that America’s tough sanctions against Lebanon have been largely ineffective as the Arab country has been receiving desperately-needed fuel from Iran, which is itself under severe sanctions imposed by Washington. In a Twitter post on Friday, Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Jim Risch said, “Lebanon’s receipt of US-sanctioned Iranian fuel, trucked-in by Hezbollah through Syria, is a disappointing sign for the future of Lebanon’s accountability and democracy.” “US sanctions must mean something.

The plan to buy Iranian fuel, first announced by Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on August 19, marked a watershed in foiling the US sanctions, which have severely affected the two countries. The first ship containing Iranian fuel entered Syria’s territorial waters early September. On Thursday, a convoy of tanker trucks carrying Iranian fuel, arranged by Hezbollah, arrived in Lebanon, with Lebanese media reporting that the tankers loaded with Iranian mazut entered the village of Hawsh al-Sayyed Ali in Lebanon’s northeastern Baalbek-Hermel province. As tanker trucks entered from Syria in the eastern region of Hermel, they were greeted by large crowds of people waving Hezbollah's yellow flag and women tossing rice and rose petals. Hezbollah declared that it had broken an "American siege." The next Iranian ships are also expected to deliver their cargo to Lebanon through the same pathway. Earlier this week, Nasrallah said the Iranian fuel shipments would be distributed free of charge to institutions, including state hospitals, nursing homes, orphanages, and the Red Cross. In announcing the plan, Hezbollah’s chief warned the US and Israel that the resistance movement would consider the tanker trucks and next Iranian ships “Lebanese territory” from the moment they sail.

News article:
Progressive Socialist Party leader Walid Jumblat on Friday commented sarcastically on the entry of Hizbullah-imported Iranian diesel from Syria into Lebanon. “We no longer know from where the diesel, gasoline and oil convoys are coming,” Jumblat said in a tweet. “Those who care for us have become numerous to an extent that we might become an oil exporting country without border demarcation and without excavation -- neither in the north nor in the south nor at sea nor on land,” the PSP leader added. Jumblat is believed to be a co-owner of at least one Lebanese oil and gas company. Dozens of tanker trucks carrying Iranian fuel arranged by Hizbullah arrived in shortage-hit Lebanon Thursday. As they entered from Syria through an illegal crossing in the eastern region of Hermel, the trucks were greeted by Hizbullah supporters waving the group's yellow flag and ululating women tossing rice and rose petals. Hizbullah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah had promised in August he would bring fuel from Iran to alleviate the rationing that is sowing chaos across the country. A first Iranian ship reached the Syrian port of Baniyas earlier this week. The cargo was offloaded there and trucked to Lebanon, the first of several planned deliveries. A total of 80 trucks carrying four million liters (more than one million gallons) of petrol entered Lebanon on Thursday and were expected to fill the tanks of Al-Amana, a fuel distribution company which is owned by Hizbullah and has been under U.S. sanctions since February 2020. "This is humanitarian aid that will meet the needs of the population," said Jawad, a 50-year-old Hermel resident who was among the crowd gathered to welcome the convoy. Hizbullah "is not replacing the state, it's a temporary measure until the state can deliver its duties," he said. For critics, however, the convoy is a symbol of the dissolution of the Lebanese state. "Don't forget this day," tweeted Laury Haytayan, a Lebanese oil and gas expert and activist, describing it as the day Hizbullah won over the Lebanese state. Hizbullah is often accused by its opponents of operating a state-within-a-state and has been taking part in Syria's civil war alongside government forces. Nasrallah's announcement last month was a boon for the Tehran-backed movement and prompted the announcement of several other fuel supply schemes via other regional powers. The amount of Iranian petrol being delivered can only meet a small part of the demand in Lebanon, where motorists spend hours -- sometimes days -- in queues to fill up. Under another initiative to bring some power to the country, energy ministers from Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon earlier this month agreed a plan to bring Egyptian gas and Jordanian electricity to Lebanon via Syria. The United States has backed the plan and given rare approval for the Arab neighbors to escape punishment under sanctions targeting the Syrian regime.

News article:
Progressive Socialist Party leader Walid Jumblat on Friday commented sarcastically on the entry of Hizbullah-imported Iranian diesel from Syria into Lebanon. “We no longer know from where the diesel, gasoline and oil convoys are coming,” Jumblat said in a tweet. “Those who care for us have become numerous to an extent that we might become an oil exporting country without border demarcation and without excavation -- neither in the north nor in the south nor at sea nor on land,” the PSP leader added. Jumblat is believed to be a co-owner of at least one Lebanese oil and gas company. Dozens of tanker trucks carrying Iranian fuel arranged by Hizbullah arrived in shortage-hit Lebanon Thursday. As they entered from Syria through an illegal crossing in the eastern region of Hermel, the trucks were greeted by Hizbullah supporters waving the group's yellow flag and ululating women tossing rice and rose petals. Hizbullah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah had promised in August he would bring fuel from Iran to alleviate the rationing that is sowing chaos across the country. A first Iranian ship reached the Syrian port of Baniyas earlier this week. The cargo was offloaded there and trucked to Lebanon, the first of several planned deliveries. A total of 80 trucks carrying four million liters (more than one million gallons) of petrol entered Lebanon on Thursday and were expected to fill the tanks of Al-Amana, a fuel distribution company which is owned by Hizbullah and has been under U.S. sanctions since February 2020. "This is humanitarian aid that will meet the needs of the population," said Jawad, a 50-year-old Hermel resident who was among the crowd gathered to welcome the convoy. Hizbullah "is not replacing the state, it's a temporary measure until the state can deliver its duties," he said. For critics, however, the convoy is a symbol of the dissolution of the Lebanese state. "Don't forget this day," tweeted Laury Haytayan, a Lebanese oil and gas expert and activist, describing it as the day Hizbullah won over the Lebanese state. Hizbullah is often accused by its opponents of operating a state-within-a-state and has been taking part in Syria's civil war alongside government forces. Nasrallah's announcement last month was a boon for the Tehran-backed movement and prompted the announcement of several other fuel supply schemes via other regional powers. The amount of Iranian petrol being delivered can only meet a small part of the demand in Lebanon, where motorists spend hours -- sometimes days -- in queues to fill up. Under another initiative to bring some power to the country, energy ministers from Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon earlier this month agreed a plan to bring Egyptian gas and Jordanian electricity to Lebanon via Syria. The United States has backed the plan and given rare approval for the Arab neighbors to escape punishment under sanctions targeting the Syrian regime.

News article:
By Denijal Jegić Amidst Lebanon’s grave crisis, the resistance movement Hezbollah has facilitated the import of tons of fuel from Iran. Confronting the increasing isolation of Lebanon, the cooperation between Iran and Hezbollah indicates a break of US sanctions and further disrupts Washington’s hegemony in Western Asia. Iranian fuel arrives in Lebanon. The first convoys of trucks carrying oil from Iran arrived in Lebanon via Syria this week, welcomed by cheering Lebanese citizens. A banner declared "Thank you Iran. Thank you Assad's Syria.” The import from Iran comes at a crucial time. Lebanon has been collapsing due to an economic and political crisis. Most of the population now lives below the poverty line. The already fragile electricity supply has further diminished due to a severe fuel shortage. Much of the population is left without proper electricity. Hezbollah will donate the first fuel delivery to institutions in need, including hospitals, nursing homes, the Red Cross, and orphanages. When Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah announced the fuel import last month, he spoke of an economic war against Lebanon that is led by the United States and is benefitting the Israeli regime. Hezbollah’s requests to purchase fuel from Iran at a lower price in Lebanese currency were rejected by the Lebanese government out of concern over further US sanctions. While Western powers deny that there is a blockade against Lebanon, they have tied prospective aid to Lebanon to the enactment of political reforms. Breaking the sanctions The successful delivery of fuel from Iran through Syria to Lebanon is a significant achievement, given that all three countries are faced, directly and indirectly, with international sanctions as part of the US maximum pressure campaign. Lebanon is being punished in the foreign efforts against Hezbollah, primarily because of the resistance movement’s deterrence against the Israeli regime. Indeed, a major goal behind the pressure waged against Lebanon by both external forces and local proxies is to weaken and potentially coerce the resistance movement into surrender. Hezbollah is not only a major political party in the country and an indigenous resistance movement, but also a representative of a large part of the Lebanese population and a regional military power. Israel faced major defeats by Hezbollah which remains the colony’s most imminent threat. The continuous Israeli attempts to confront Hezbollah have failed. And so have the US sanctions While the sanctions are a major obstacle to cooperation within the region, the legal or moral legitimacy of these sanctions is rarely questioned by US allies. To some extent, the brutal sanctions have been accepted as a natural circumstance, although, as a means of economic warfare, they effectively lead to the death of ordinary people. The fear of provoking further US actions has shaped the political situation in Lebanon. Former Prime Minister Saad Hariri, an ally of the US, previously rejected the Iranian fuel shipment, claiming that Hezbollah’s announcement to import fuel was a threat and a violation of Lebanese sovereignty. He feared sanctions. On the same day of Hariri’s comments, Israel invaded Lebanese airspace to carry out airstrikes against Syria, using civilian airplanes over Beirut as human shields. The US allies remained largely silent on these violations of Lebanese sovereignty. Sanctions are not working The effects of the isolation of Lebanon are directly felt by its population, including those who support the United States, while Washington has not reached its political goals. In fact, the recent developments emphasize that the maximum pressure campaign waged by Trump and now Biden is failing. In a surprising move, Cesar Maalouf, an MP of the right-wing pro-US party “Lebanese Forces” that is known for its anti-Iranian stance, fierce opposition to Hezbollah, and previous collaboration with the Israeli regime, recently came out in support of Iranian aid. He asked why Lebanon should not be allowed to receive aid from an ally, when the West and Arab regimes have failed the country. Earlier this month, the outgoing Lebanese caretaker government met with Syrian government representatives in Damascus in the first official visit in a decade. Syria agreed to transit gas and electricity from Egypt and Jordan to Lebanon. The United States approved of these plans, effectively agreeing to waive its sanctions on transactions with the Syrian government. This came after Sayyed Nasrallah’s initial announcement of the oil delivery in August. It seems that the United States is confronted with a lack of options, as its maximum pressure from the outside has resulted in increased cooperation between those who are marginalized and sanctioned by US imperial policies. Disrupting the power of the US in Western Asia Neither the US nor Israel prevented the Iranian fuel from reaching Lebanon. Besides new sanctions against individuals affiliated with Hezbollah, the US response was rather muted. Former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared a year ago that the US would do everything possible “to make sure that Iran cannot continue to sell crude oil anywhere, including to Hezbollah in the region.” In fact, a US senator now acknowledged that sanctions against Lebanon have been ineffective. Despite the stubborn imperialist efforts, Iran and Hezbollah have been able to defy the sanctions and strengthen their cooperation, which is, after all, based on shared solidarity - a concept that seems to pose a significant threat to the US role in the region.

News article:
A senior Hezbollah official has praised the arrival of the first Iranian fuel cargo in Lebanon, saying the resistance movement made the decision to import fuel from the Islamic Republic in order to preserve the dignity of the Lebanese nation and end their humiliation amid a dire financial crisis. Speaking at a ceremony in Nabi Osman village in the northern part of the Bekaa Valley on Sunday, head of Hezbollah's political bureau Ibrahim Amin al-Sayyed strongly criticized Lebanese authorities for their failure to address people’s woes. “Lebanese officials only know how to receive huge sums of money from embassies and squander them… Cash is being funneled by Americans, Europeans, [Persian] Gulf states as well as Saudi Arabia,” he said. The high-ranking Hezbollah official noted, “The resistance exposed their crimes, lies, and betrayal of the nation... Will the resistance’s move prompt the [Lebanese] government to solve people's problems, and import gas, oil, and fuel?” “We cannot count on failed cowards to address people's woes,” Sayyed said, adding, “We will, therefore, act ourselves with regards to fuel or anything to do with people's lives.” He emphasized that Hezbollah has for years been urging Lebanese government officials to improve relations with Syria, and to import agricultural and industrial products from the neighboring country. “It is a shame that Lebanese officials decided to send a delegation [to Syria] after the approval of US Ambassador [Dorothy C. Shea] and when they were sure that Iran was sending fuel tankers to Lebanon. America now wants to supply us with gas from Egypt and Jordan,” Sayyed noted. On September 16, dozens of tanker trucks carrying Iranian fuel arranged by Hezbollah arrived in Lebanon. Hezbollah declared that it had broken an "American siege." As they entered from Syria in the eastern region of Hermel, the trucks were greeted by large crowds of people waving Hezbollah's yellow flag and ululating women tossing rice and rose petals. Last week, Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the Iranian fuel shipments would be distributed free of charge to institutions, including state hospitals, nursing homes, orphanages and the Red Cross. “[Hezbollah] is not looking to make a business out of this but wants to help ease the people’s hardships,” the Hezbollah secretary general said, adding that the rest of the Iranian fuel would be sold “below cost” to bakeries, private hospitals or companies that run private generators. Lebanon has been mired in a deep economic and financial crisis since late 2019. The crisis is the gravest threat to the country’s stability since the 15-year civil war ended in 1990. The economic and financial crisis is mostly linked to the sanctions that the United States and its allies have imposed on Lebanon as well as foreign intervention in the Arab nation’s domestic affairs. Compounding the woes, Saudi Arabia has imposed its own sanctions, including banning its citizens from traveling to Lebanon where Riyadh-backed elements have been jockeying for positions. A new government was formed earlier this month to negotiate a financial rescue plan with international organizations.

News article:
Lebanon’s media outlets have reported entrance into the United States-sanctioned country of a fifth shipment carrying Iranian fuel as announced earlier by the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah. Reporting on Wednesday, the al-Mayadeen television network said the shipment was passing through the Syrian border into Lebanon carrying fuel residue. According to Lebanese sources, the consignments were passing into Lebanon through the Hermel-al-Qasir border area. The shipments have been reaching Lebanon in the face of the US’s sanctions targeting both the Islamic Republic and the country. The US re-imposed its sanctions on Iran in 2018 after illegally leaving a historic nuclear accord between the Islamic Republic and world countries. It has been enforcing similar measures against Lebanon for more than a year to pressure the country over influence wielded in its political and military sectors by Hezbollah. In the 2000s, the movement fought off two major wars on Lebanon that had been waged by the Israeli regime, Washington’s most treasured ally in the region. The sanctions have taken huge toll on the Lebanese economy, leading to acute shortage of staples, including gasoline and diesel. Hezbollah has, however, vowed that the country would keep importing Iranian fuel, pledging not to allow Washington to further interfere with the Lebanese people’s livelihoods. During his speeches, Hezbollah’s Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has identified the American Embassy in Beirut as the “operation room” devising sabotage plots against the country’s economy. Announcing pending arrival of the third and fourth consignments on September 12, Nasrallah said some had hoped and speculated that the Israeli regime would intervene and target the shipments. The speculations, however, simply served propagandist media purposes, he said, adding, “It became finally clear that such remarks are false.”

News article:
The deputy secretary general of Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah says the group’s import of Iranian fuel into Lebanon perplexed the US administration and its siege on Lebanon. In an interview with al-Manar TV Channel on Friday, Sheikh Naim Qassem said the Iranian fuel shipments prompted Washington to approve the project of providing Lebanon with Egyptian gas and Jordanian electricity via Syria despite its sanctions against Damascus. Sheikh Qassem stressed that Hezbollah will continue to import Iranian fuel as long as the US siege on Lebanon remains in place. Earlier this month, energy ministers from Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt came together in the Jordanian capital, Amman, where they agreed that Lebanon, which is going through crippling fuel shortages, would import Egyptian gas and Jordanian electricity via Syria. The United States, with the intention of countering what it calls Iranian influence in Lebanon, also supported the agreement, with US Ambassador to Beirut Dorothy Shea announcing that some of what are known as the Caesar Act sanctions against Syria could be amended to deal with the fuel transports. The plan came weeks after Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah announced the import of Iranian fuel to help Lebanon weather serious fuel shortages. The Iranian fuel shipments also pass through Syria. The United States has imposed sanctions against Lebanon to pressure the country over the influence Hezbollah wields in its political and military sectors. Early this month, the first ship arrived in Syria to be transferred to Lebanon via land. Hezbollah announced on Friday that the second ship has also arrived in Syria. Both Hezbollah and Iran have sternly warned the US and Israel against any move against the fuel tankers. Hezbollah is ready to confront any Israeli aggression on Lebanon, even if this leads to an all-out war, Sheikh Qassem said, adding that the deterrence formula prevents the Zionist regime from committing such a folly. According to Sheikh Qassem, the fuel imports were aimed at relieving Lebanese people who are suffering from the ongoing crisis. He said the Lebanese authorities rejected to approve the process for fear of US sanctions. He also said the Lebanese resistance group will act against any Israeli infringement on Lebanon’s maritime borders and rights after the government addresses the legal side of the issue. ‘Our weapons are locked and loaded’ Sheikh Qassem also said any attack by Israel on Lebanon will be met with a response from Hezbollah. “Any Israeli attack on Lebanon will be met with a response from Hezbollah. Even if [Lebanon] is dragged into a war, we will face the war. Our weapons are locked and loaded. If we need more [weapons], we have our ways to rearm ourselves,” he said. The Hezbollah official declared that Hezbollah will continue to bring Iranian fuel as long as Lebanon’s central bank and Lebanese fuel companies do not supply Lebanon’s fuel needs. “We are waiting for the Lebanese government’s position on the indirect negotiations with [the Israeli enemy] regarding the border issue, and when our turn arrives, we will do our duty,” he added. The remarks came after Lebanese President Michelle Aoun told the UN General Assembly that Lebanon was ready for a resumption of the indirect talks on Lebanon’s maritime dispute with Israel in line with international law. “We remain gravely concerned at Israel’s repeated threats against Lebanon, and more recently Israel’s plans to carry out oil and gas exploration activities along the contested maritime border,” Aoun said. “We condemn any and all attempts to violate the limits of our exclusive economic zone and we maintain our right to the oil and gas found within that zone,” he added. Lebanon is odds with Israel over the latter's encroachment on the Arab nation's territorial waters in the Mediterranean, which hold valuable gas reserves. Since October, they have been holding on-and-off US-mediated talks in an effort to resolve the issue.

Sheikh Qassem stressed that Hezbollah will continue to import Iranian fuel as long as the US siege on Lebanon remains in place. Earlier this month, energy ministers from Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt came together in the Jordanian capital, Amman, where they agreed that Lebanon, which is going through crippling fuel shortages, would import Egyptian gas and Jordanian electricity via Syria. The United States, with the intention of countering what it calls Iranian influence in Lebanon, also supported the agreement, with US Ambassador to Beirut Dorothy Shea announcing that some of what are known as the Caesar Act sanctions against Syria could be amended to deal with the fuel transports. The plan came weeks after Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah announced the import of Iranian fuel to help Lebanon weather serious fuel shortages. The Iranian fuel shipments also pass through Syria. The United States has imposed sanctions against Lebanon to pressure the country over the influence Hezbollah wields in its political and military sectors. Early this month, the first ship arrived in Syria to be transferred to Lebanon via land. Hezbollah announced on Friday that the second ship has also arrived in Syria. Both Hezbollah and Iran have sternly warned the US and Israel against any move against the fuel tankers. Hezbollah is ready to confront any Israeli aggression on Lebanon, even if this leads to an all-out war, Sheikh Qassem said, adding that the deterrence formula prevents the Zionist regime from committing such a folly. According to Sheikh Qassem, the fuel imports were aimed at relieving Lebanese people who are suffering from the ongoing crisis. He said the Lebanese authorities rejected to approve the process for fear of US sanctions. He also said the Lebanese resistance group will act against any Israeli infringement on Lebanon’s maritime borders and rights after the government addresses the legal side of the issue. ‘Our weapons are locked and loaded’ Sheikh Qassem also said any attack by Israel on Lebanon will be met with a response from Hezbollah. “Any Israeli attack on Lebanon will be met with a response from Hezbollah. Even if [Lebanon] is dragged into a war, we will face the war. Our weapons are locked and loaded. If we need more [weapons], we have our ways to rearm ourselves,” he said. The Hezbollah official declared that Hezbollah will continue to bring Iranian fuel as long as Lebanon’s central bank and Lebanese fuel companies do not supply Lebanon’s fuel needs. “We are waiting for the Lebanese government’s position on the indirect negotiations with [the Israeli enemy] regarding the border issue, and when our turn arrives, we will do our duty,” he added. The remarks came after Lebanese President Michelle Aoun told the UN General Assembly that Lebanon was ready for a resumption of the indirect talks on Lebanon’s maritime dispute with Israel in line with international law. “We remain gravely concerned at Israel’s repeated threats against Lebanon, and more recently Israel’s plans to carry out oil and gas exploration activities along the contested maritime border,” Aoun said. “We condemn any and all attempts to violate the limits of our exclusive economic zone and we maintain our right to the oil and gas found within that zone,” he added. Lebanon is odds with Israel over the latter's encroachment on the Arab nation's territorial waters in the Mediterranean, which hold valuable gas reserves. Since October, they have been holding on-and-off US-mediated talks in an effort to resolve the issue.

News article:
BEIRUT, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The Lebanese government has received no request for fuel to be imported from Iran, the caretaker energy minister said on Wednesday, appearing to confirm that the Shi'ite group Hezbollah has bypassed the state with a move to import Iranian fuel. Hezbollah, a heavily armed group founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982, announced last month thata shipment of Iranian fuel oil was on its way to help ease crippling shortages. read more The group is by far the most powerful faction in Lebanon, where it has been part of the ruling system for years. The fuel crisis, caused by a broader meltdown of Lebanon's economy and plunge in the value of its currency, has forced even essential services to shut down or scale back operations. Hezbollah's opponents say the declaration, followed by announcements of two further Iranian fuel shipments for Lebanon, has further undermined the authority of the state and exposed Lebanon to the risk of U.S. sanctions. Asked about the Iranian shipment, the caretaker energy minister Raymond Ghajar told journalists "our role is restricted to import permits, we did not receive a request for permission". Asked if this meant the ship was coming without permits, Ghajar said: "No. We do not have information. Permission was not requested from us. This is all I am saying." The first shipment has yet to arrive, and Hezbollah has not announced details of where it will dock. Tanker Trackers, which monitors shipments and oil storage, said satellite imagery showed that the second and third tankers had yet to depart. "The first tanker should be in the southern section of the Red Sea by now," it added. "Awaiting visual confirmation." Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Shi'ite Muslim ally of Hezbollah and one of the most powerful figures in the state, said on Tuesday he welcomed any support, including from Iran, to help Lebanon through its crisis.

News article:
DUBAI, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Iran said on Monday it is ready to ship more fuel to Lebanon if needed, a day after the leader of Lebanon's Iran-aligned Hezbollah group said more vessels carrying Iranian fuel would sail soon to help ease the country's fuel shortage. "We sell our oil and its products based on our own decisions and the needs of our friend. Iran is ready to send fuel again to Lebanon if needed," Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh said in an online weekly news conference. "Certainly we cannot see the suffering of the Lebanese people." On Sunday Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah said the first vessel shipping Iranian fuel to Lebanon, which last Thursday the group announced was about to leave Iran, had already sailed. Last week Iran's semi-official Nournews news website reported that the fuel shipments to Lebanon were all purchased by a group of Lebanese Shi'ite businessmen. "We announce our readiness to sell fuel to the Lebanese government in addition to the fuel purchased by the Lebanese Shi'ite businessmen, if the Lebanese government is willing," said Khatibzadeh. Hezbollah's foes in Lebanon have warned of dire consequences from the purchase, saying it risked sanctions being imposed on a country whose economy has been in meltdown for nearly two years. U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil exports, reimposed in 2018 when then-President Donald Trump exited Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers, aim to cut its crude sales to zero. Hezbollah, founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982, has also been targeted by U.S. sanctions.

News article:
A high-ranking Hezbollah official says Iran's fuel shipments to Lebanon dealt a heavy blow to sanctions imposed by the US and its allies on the Arab country, but the resistance movement will double down with other measures. “Fuel imports from Iran will not be the last step, as we have many other measures to take,” Hashim Safi al-Din, the head of the Executive Council of Hezbollah, said at a ceremony in the southern Lebanese town of Bint Jbeil on Sunday night. He said Lebanon is currently facing numerous crises and challenges, because it is now an integral part of the regional equations, but it needs to emerge victorious and dignified out of them and to move towards a new phase. “We know that some Lebanese citizens are afraid of the word 'challenge'. Nevertheless, Hezbollah will stand committed to the protection of our country, our nation, and our future,” Safi al-Din said. "There is no way to strengthen Lebanon other than performing a leading role in regional equations. Any other initiative is worthless, and falls within the framework of capitulation and surrender to Israel’s interests," he added. Safi al-Din said not only did the arrival of Iranian fuel shipments into Lebanon help solve the country's dire shortages, but it also showed Israel’s inability in maritime terms to stop Lebanon-bound oil tankers sent by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Israeli enemy, he said, is not seeking a naval confrontation with Hezbollah, which would expose the weakness of the regime. "They know very well that our missiles can strike the farthest point deep inside the occupied territories. Israel is also aware of the fact that we can prevent any ship from docking in the port cities of Acre, Haifa and Tel Aviv or any other region in the occupied lands." Tanker Trackers said on Friday that the third ship carrying Iranian gasoil or gasoline for distribution in Lebanon had entered the Gulf of Suez from the Red Sea. It identified the vessel as Fortune. The third tanker carrying Iranian gasoil or gasoline for Hezb'Allah's distribution in #Lebanon (via Baniyas, Syria) has now re-appeared on AIS. Her name is FORTUNE (9283746) and has entered the Gulf of Suez from the Red Sea. FAXON, FOREST and FORTUNE visited Venezuela in 2020. pic.twitter.com/17fD0VqjZP — TankerTrackers.com, Inc. (@TankerTrackers) October 1, 2021 Last month, the first tanker trucks carrying Iranian fuel arranged by Hezbollah arrived in Lebanon, with the resistance group declaring that it had broken the "American siege." Lebanon has been mired in a deep economic and financial crisis since late 2019. The crisis is the gravest threat to the country’s stability since the 15-year civil war ended in 1990. The economic and financial crisis is mostly linked to the sanctions that the United States and its allies have imposed on Lebanon as well as foreign intervention in the Arab nation’s domestic affairs. Last month, Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the Iranian fuel shipments would be distributed free of charge to institutions, including state hospitals, nursing homes, orphanages and the Red Cross. “[Hezbollah] is not looking to make a business out of this but wants to help ease the people’s hardships,” he said, adding that the rest of the Iranian fuel would be sold “below cost” to bakeries, private hospitals or companies that run private generators.

News article:
Asharq Al-Awsat Israel launched a massive manhunt in the country’s north and the occupied West Bank early Monday after six Palestinian prisoners tunneled out of their cell and escaped from a high-security facility in the biggest prison break of its kind in decades. The escape marks an embarrassing security breach just ahead of the Jewish New Year, when Israelis flock to the north to enjoy beaches, campsites and the Sea of Galilee. The prisoners appear to have gone into hiding and there was no indication Israeli authorities view them as an immediate threat. Palestinians consider prisoners held by Israel to be heroes of their national cause, and many celebrated the escape on social media. Efforts to capture the escapees will likely draw attention to the Palestinian Authority’s security coordination with Israel, which is deeply unpopular among Palestinians. There was no immediate comment from the PA, but President Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah party praised the escape. Israeli officials said they have erected roadblocks and are conducting patrols in the area. Israel’s Army Radio said 400 prisoners are being moved as a protective measure against any additional escape attempts. The radio said the prisoners escaped through a tunnel from the Gilboa prison, just north of the West Bank, which is supposed to be one of Israel’s most secure facilities. A photo released by the prison service showed a narrow hole in the floor of a cell, and Israeli security forces could be seen examining a similar hole on a stretch of gravel just outside the walls of the prison. It appeared to be the biggest Palestinian escape from an Israeli prison since 1987, when six militants from the “Islamic Jihad” group broke out of a heavily guarded prison in Gaza months before the outbreak of the first intifada, or Palestinian uprising against Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett called it a “grave incident” that required maximum effort by Israel’s various security branches. He said he was receiving constant updates on the prison break, which occurred just hours before Israel was to mark the Jewish New Year. There were no instructions for people to alter their routines. Israeli media quoted Public Security Minister Omer Barlev as saying that extensive planning went into the escape and that the prisoners likely had “outside assistance.” Palestinian prisoners are believed to use smuggled cellphones to communicate with people outside, and the escapees may have arranged for a getaway vehicle. Police commander Shimon Ben Shabo said officials have reinforced emergency response call centers in the area to respond to any reports about the prisoners and there are “forces available to arrive at any location.” The escapees are suspected of having headed back to their hometown of Jenin, in the occupied West Bank, about a 25 kilometer (15-mile) drive away. The PA wields little control in the town, where militants in recent weeks have clashed with Israeli forces. Israeli helicopters were seen flying over Jenin on Monday morning. The Palestinian Prisoners’ Club, which represents both former and current prisoners, identified the men as ranging in age from 26 to 49 years old. The most well-known is Zakaria Zubeidi, 46, who was a prominent leader in the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an armed group affiliated with Fatah, during the second intifada from 2000-2005. He was later granted amnesty along with other Fatah-affiliated militants, but was arrested again in 2019 on what Israeli authorities said were new terror suspicions. As a child, Zubeidi had been part of a children’s theater troupe in Jenin established by Arna Mer-Khamis, an Israeli rights activist, that was the subject of a 2004 documentary. The other five prisoners were members of “Islamic Jihad”, and the prisoners’ group said four were serving life sentences. Hundreds of “Jihad” supporters rallied in Gaza, and the militant group sent incendiary balloons across the frontier into Israel in support of the escaped prisoners. “This is a great heroic act, which will cause a severe shock to the Israeli security system,” said Daoud Shehab, a spokesman for the group. Fawzi Barhoum, a spokesman for the Hamas movement that rules Gaza, said the escape shows “that the struggle for freedom from the occupier is continuous and extended, inside prisons and outside.” Even Abbas’ Fatah party praised the escape, with an official Twitter account posting a picture of Zubeidi and hailing what it called the “freedom tunnel.” The escape poses a dilemma for Abbas, who met with Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz a week ago in the first high-level meeting between the two sides in years. Abbas has said he hopes to revive the peace process after more than a decade-long hiatus under former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

He was later granted amnesty along with other Fatah-affiliated militants, but was arrested again in 2019 on what Israeli authorities said were new terror suspicions. As a child, Zubeidi had been part of a children’s theater troupe in Jenin established by Arna Mer-Khamis, an Israeli rights activist, that was the subject of a 2004 documentary. The other five prisoners were members of “Islamic Jihad”, and the prisoners’ group said four were serving life sentences. Hundreds of “Jihad” supporters rallied in Gaza, and the militant group sent incendiary balloons across the frontier into Israel in support of the escaped prisoners. “This is a great heroic act, which will cause a severe shock to the Israeli security system,” said Daoud Shehab, a spokesman for the group. Fawzi Barhoum, a spokesman for the Hamas movement that rules Gaza, said the escape shows “that the struggle for freedom from the occupier is continuous and extended, inside prisons and outside.” Even Abbas’ Fatah party praised the escape, with an official Twitter account posting a picture of Zubeidi and hailing what it called the “freedom tunnel.” The escape poses a dilemma for Abbas, who met with Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz a week ago in the first high-level meeting between the two sides in years. Abbas has said he hopes to revive the peace process after more than a decade-long hiatus under former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The architectural blueprint for Gilboa Prison that six Palestinian prisoners escaped from early Monday was published online and possibly helped the inmates flee. The prison opened in 2004 and is considered highly secure, but the blueprint was published online by the architecture firm that took part in the prison's construction, making it accessible to the public. The plan, drawn by Poreh Yaacovi Karni Architects, shows the structure of Gilboa Prison, including Wing 2 from where the prisoners escaped. Poreh Yaacovi Karni Architects' website was taken offline on Monday, but a Google search can still find the prison's architectural blueprint, as well as those of other prisons across Israel. At this stage, it remains unclear whether the blueprint helped the prisoners escape, but a senior Israel Prison Service official said that publishing the blueprint online is a grave "security oversight.

News article:
A new report quoting a source close to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad has released more details of the recent daring operation by six Palestinian inmates that led to their escape from Israel's maximum-security Gilboa prison last Monday. The Palestinian prisoners escaped from the Israeli prison in the early hours of Monday, with regime troops launching a manhunt to arrest them. Five of them belong to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), hailing from towns near the occupied northern West Bank city of Jenin. The inmates have been identified as Munadil Nafayat, 26, from Yaabad; Mahmoud and Mohammad al-Arida, both from Arraba; Iham Kahamji, 35, from Kufr Dan; and Yaqoub Qadiri, 49, from Deir al-Basha. The other prisoner has been identified as Zakaria Zubaidi, a former commander of Fatah's al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades in Jenin. “The prisoners dug a tunnel under the bathroom sink – something that had been done and discovered by guards several years ago in the very same Gilboa prison. This time, however, the escape of the six captives and their intricately dug tunnel went unnoticed for at least three hours after they fled,” said privately-obtained information disclosed by an Islamic Jihad source. The source revealed that the day before the escape, Zubaidi had requested a transfer from the Fatah prisoner section in the highly-fortified Gilboa prison to the PIJ section and aware of a strong link between him and the PIJ prisoners, the prison administration approved the transfer. "55-year-old Sheikh Raed al-Saadi, incarcerated for 33 years by the Israelis and dean of PIJ detainees in Israel’s prison system, was in that room. The title “dean” is bestowed upon detainees who have spent more than 20 years in prison, while those who have spent more than 25 years are nicknamed “Generals of Patience,” the source underlined. “The other five PIJ prisoners in that section had all been sentenced to life imprisonment. They were active in the Al-Quds Brigades and had carried out a series of operations against the Israeli occupiers,” the source said. “Zubaidi has a long history of armed resistance,” the source added. “At the close of the second intifada in 2002, he and other Fatah members were given an amnesty after Operation Defensive Wall was concluded, and Zubaidi underwent a ‘rehabilitation process’ until he was re-arrested in 2019 for shooting at settlements in the West Bank,” the source added. The PIJ source also revealed that this is not the first time that Palestinian prisoners have escaped from Israel’s maximum security prisons. “Six PIJ detainees were able to break out of Gaza Central Prison in May 1987,” the privately-obtained information said. “The prisoners hid out in a house adjacent to the prison, while the Israeli army hovered above the Gaza Strip searching for them.” The source added that the most prominent of the Israeli jailbreaks was in July 1958, when violent clashes took place between the prisoners and their jailers in Shatta, near Gilboa. "Sixty-six prisoners managed to flee confinement, but 11 other Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers were killed in the daring escapade," the source said. "Then, in 1998, 24 prisoners from various Palestinian political factions tried to break out of Shatta prison. The plan would have succeeded had it not been for the third prisoner to emerge from the tunnel which had taken weeks to dig. He was wearing his shoes, and guard dogs were alerted to the sound of his steps." Meanwhile, Muhammad Jaradat, a freed prisoner who resides in Jenin, has recounted his time in Gilboa prison in 2004. “I will never forget the day I entered the armored steel vault called Gilboa after a brutal interrogation for three months. I extended my hand from the tiny window that overlooks a sealed courtyard, hoping to touch the breeze from my city Jenin mixed with the winds of Marj Ibn Amer, but there was none. We were inside an armored box of iron and concrete, amidst a security system boasting the latest modern technology created by American and British minds – in order to break men.” Jaradat, who was a member of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, later published a book in Beirut entitled Ibn Taymiyyah: Between the Illusion of Reference and the Dominion of Blood. Since the latest jailbreak on September 6, Israeli forces have stormed dozens of areas across the occupied West Bank district of Jenin, where they conducted extensive searches and raids to find the six Palestinian inmates. According to Palestinian media outlets, the Israeli forces raided the homes of the six escaped prisoners and began to arrest their relatives. The regime’s army claims that its extensive searches are part of efforts to find the six Palestinian political prisoners who escaped from Gilboa prison. Palestinian prisoners have been subjected to systematic torture, harassment and repression all through the years of Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories. The Israeli Prison Service (IPS) keeps Palestinian prisoners in deplorable conditions lacking proper hygienic standards. More than 7,000 Palestinian prisoners are currently held in some 17 Israeli jails, with dozens of them serving multiple life sentences. Israeli forces have arrested more than 17,000 minors since 2000.

Fathiyeh Al Ardeh, mother of Mahmoud Al Ardeh, one of six Palestinian prisoners who escaped from Israel’s Gilboa Prison, holds up her hands as she prays for him at her home in the village of Arabah, south of Jenin in the occupied West Bank, on Wednesday (AFP photo) RAMALLAH, Palestinian Territories — Israeli forces have arrested at least six relatives of Palestinians who broke out of a high-security jail, a local watchdog said on Wednesday amid protests in support of the escapees. The six Palestinians staged their jailbreak on Monday through a hole they had dug under a sink in a Gilboa prison cell in northern Israel — reportedly using a spoon. Israel has deployed drones, road checkpoints and an army mission to Jenin, the home town in the occupied West Bank of many of the men locked up for their roles in attacks on Israel. The Palestinian Prisoners’ Club said two brothers of Mahmoud Ardah, described in local media as the mastermind of the escape, have been arrested. The forces has also taken into custody four other people — fellow family member Dr Nidal Ardah, two brothers of Mahmoud’s cousin and fellow fugitive Mohammad Ardah and the father of Munadel Infeiat, another escapee. All three of these escapees are members of the Islamic Jihad armed group. Amani Sarahneh, a spokeswoman for the prisoners’ group, told AFP that others could also have been arrested, while some had been only briefly detained. Asked by AFP, the Israeli forces — which has occupied the West Bank since 1967 — said “several arrests were made overnight”, without elaborating. “Holding someone in order to coerce a relative to do something is a mafia-style tactic,” tweeted Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director for Human Rights Watch, on Wednesday. An Israeli injunction is in effect against publishing details of the jailbreak investigation, even as local media report on the scramble to recover from the embarrassing lapse and prevent any possible attack by the fugitives. The group on the run includes Zakaria Zubeidi, a former militant leader from Jenin. The Palestinian Prisoners’ Club reported “tensions” in Israeli prisons on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for the Israeli prison authorities confirmed to AFP that fires had been lit in Ktziot and Ramon jails. “The situation is now under control, the fires have been extinguished,” she said as Palestinian groups called for rallies later Wednesday in Nablus, Ramallah and Jenin in support of the men on the run. Many people in the Gaza Strip and in Jenin took to the streets to celebrate when news of the escape broke on Monday. Gilboa Prison — which opened in 2004 during the second Palestinian Intifada, or uprising — is a high security site where hundreds of Palestinians are detained among other inmates. The prison service said all those held at Gilboa over “security offences” were being relocated in case more escape tunnels have been dug beneath the facility. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has called the breakout “a serious event that required a comprehensive effort by all of the security services”. His Palestinian counterpart, Mohammed Shtayyeh, said on Tuesday he was “happy” about the jailbreak.

Two Palestinian fugitives were caught on Friday after an extensive manhunt for six escapees who dug their way out of high security Israeli prison Gilboa, Haaretz reported. Members of Islamic Jihad Mahmoud Aradeh and Yakub Kadari were nabbed in Nazareth by security forces after two civilians spotted the men, and reported them as suspicious figures. The pair were taken for questioning by Israel's security organisation Shin Bet, and did not resist arrest, according to reports. Prominent prison escapee Zakaria Zubeidi, former Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade leader is yet to be caught. READ: Palestinian determination can break down the strongest barriers Israel was confounded after six escapees dug their way out of the maximum security prison and managed to escape without detection. The six escapees dug the hole over a period of time with nothing but a rusty spoon, and hid the entrance point with a loose floorboard. A day before the escape, Zubeidi was said to have requested a transfer to the cell where the other five escapees were held, which was said to have been granted with no questions asked. The six Palestinians left at around 1:00am local time, and emerged directly beneath the watch tower, where, according to security sources, the guard in the watch tower had fallen asleep. The six men then continued on foot to a waiting vehicle, where some got in and others continued walking. The alarm was initially raised by a citizen on Israel's Route 71, who claimed to have seen figures running through fields, arousing suspicions of a prison break. Subsequent reports included that of one from a gas station attendant who had seen a strange man apparently passing through. Three prisoners were reported missing by prison staff at around 03:30am, which was then increased to six unaccounted for at 4am. The Gilboa prison break is believed to be Israel's most successful instance of escaping a high security jail. The hunt for the other four fugitives continues.

News article:
Israeli police said Saturday that authorities had captured two more of the six Palestinian prisoners who had escaped from a high-security prison earlier this week, with two additional inmates still at large. Reuters reported that officials on Saturday found two of the men in a parking lot in northern Israel near the city of Nazareth, the same area where hours earlier they had located and captured two of the other escaped prisoners. Israeli police released footage purporting to show officers putting the two newly captured men, who were blindfolded and wearing handcuffs, into a vehicle, according to Reuters. The news agency noted that among those captured Saturday was Zakaria Zubeidi, an ex-commander of the Palestinian nationalist Fatah group’s Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in the West Bank. Authorities have said that the other five inmates who participated in the escape are Islamic jihad members. Police are continuing to search for two of the escapees. All of the convicts had been held in the Gilboa prison just north of the West Bank due to convictions or ongoing investigations into attacks planned and carried out against Israeli citizens. Israeli officials first launched a manhunt for the escaped prisoners on Monday as Israel’s Army Radio reported that the men were able to make their way out of the facility through a narrow hole in their prison cell floor that led to a tunnel. Reuters noted that Mohammad al-Arda, brother of Mahmoud al-Arda, one of the prisoners who has been captured by authorities, said that the escape was executed with “no back up from the inside nor coordination with the outside.” Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett condemned the prison escape earlier this week, calling it a “grave incident” that required immediate and maximum action from Israel’s national security agencies. The escape, which was praised by many Palestinians on social media, prompted Israeli officials to relocate 400 prisoners as a precaution while authorities ramped up security in the area. The escaped prisoners have also received support from Palestinian militant groups, with Islamic jihad spokesman Daoud Shehab calling the escape this week a “great heroic act [that] will cause a severe shock to the Israeli security system and will constitute a severe blow to the army and the entire system in Israel.”

Israeli police released footage purporting to show officers putting the two newly captured men, who were blindfolded and wearing handcuffs, into a vehicle, according to Reuters. The news agency noted that among those captured Saturday was Zakaria Zubeidi, an ex-commander of the Palestinian nationalist Fatah group’s Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in the West Bank. Authorities have said that the other five inmates who participated in the escape are Islamic jihad members. Police are continuing to search for two of the escapees. All of the convicts had been held in the Gilboa prison just north of the West Bank due to convictions or ongoing investigations into attacks planned and carried out against Israeli citizens. Israeli officials first launched a manhunt for the escaped prisoners on Monday as Israel’s Army Radio reported that the men were able to make their way out of the facility through a narrow hole in their prison cell floor that led to a tunnel. Reuters noted that Mohammad al-Arda, brother of Mahmoud al-Arda, one of the prisoners who has been captured by authorities, said that the escape was executed with “no back up from the inside nor coordination with the outside.” Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett condemned the prison escape earlier this week, calling it a “grave incident” that required immediate and maximum action from Israel’s national security agencies. The escape, which was praised by many Palestinians on social media, prompted Israeli officials to relocate 400 prisoners as a precaution while authorities ramped up security in the area. The escaped prisoners have also received support from Palestinian militant groups, with Islamic jihad spokesman Daoud Shehab calling the escape this week a “great heroic act [that] will cause a severe shock to the Israeli security system and will constitute a severe blow to the army and the entire system in Israel.”

Since Monday's breakout, the occupation forces have poured troops into the occupied West Bank for a massive manhunt. But the two latest fugitives to be recaptured, who include a prominent former resistance leader, were found hiding in a lorry park just outside Nazareth in northern occupied Palestine, occupation forces said. Zakaria Zubeidi, 45, is a former leader of the Fateh movement in the West Bank town of Jenin. Mohammad Ardah, 39, was sentenced to life in prison in 2002 for his role in Islamic Jihad's armed wing. "Two more prisoners who escaped were captured a short time ago... while they were hiding in a parking lot for trucks," the forces said. "The hunt for the other two fugitives continues." On Friday evening, occupation forces recaptured Yaqoub Qadri, 48, and Mahmoud Abdullah Ardah, 45, both members of Islamic Jihad. Ardah was the alleged mastermind of the escape. Huge manhunt Israeli media said occupation forces were alerted by residents who reported seeing two men searching litter bins for food. Shortly after their capture was announced on Friday, the occupation forces said that a rocket had been fired at southern Israel from the Gaza Strip, but was intercepted by air defences. Occupation forces had conducted a huge search operation for the six prisoners since they broke out of the high-security Gilboa Prison through a tunnel dug beneath a sink in a cell. The Israeli forces closed all the checkpoints connecting Israel and occupied East Jerusalem with the West Bank in a bid to prevent them escaping into Palestinian population centres. The six fugitives were all members of Palestinian resistance groups who had been convicted by Israeli courts of plotting or carrying out attacks against Israelis. Mahmoud Ardah, from Arraba near Jenin, was imprisoned in 1996 for attacks on Israel claimed by Islamic Jihad and was among four to receive a life sentence. He was held in solitary confinement in 2014 after an escape tunnel was found at Israel's Shata Prison, according to his Islamic Jihad biography. On Thursday, Israel announced a formal inquiry into lapses that allowed the six to escape. A statement from Islamic Jihad said the arrests would not erase the fact of the“heroic” escape, and said any attempt by the Israeli authorities to“take revenge” on the prisoners would be interpreted as a“declaration of war”. Hamas, the Islamist movement that runs the Gaza Strip, hailed the“heroes” of the“tunnel of freedom”, and Fatah argued that the arrests“would only increase the resolve” of Palestinians against the Israeli occupation. When news of the escape first broke on Monday, many people in the Gaza Strip and in Jenin took to the streets to celebrate. Demonstrations were also held in several West Bank towns and cities, with youths in Nablus setting tyres alight during confrontations with Israeli security forces. Palestinian resistance had called for a“Day of Rage” in support of the prisoners as the manhunt continued.

News article:
Mohammad Al-Arida, one of the escapees from Israel's Gilboa Prison last week who has since been recaptured, has been "tortured", his lawyer Khaled Mahajneh told journalists after meeting his client on Tuesday evening. Mahajneh said that Al-Arida was "very happy" with the few days that he was free. "The fruit that he had for the first time in 22 years compensated for all the time that he was behind bars," explained the lawyer. However, he pointed out that he has been "exposed to harsh torture" following his recapture. According to Mahajneh, Al-Arida has "wounds all over his body, after being interrogated by "twenty" Israeli officials. The prisoner was stripped and naked for much of the interrogation, he added. "He has slept for just ten hours since last Saturday, and faced continuous interrogation," said Mahajneh. "One of the interrogators told him: 'You do not deserve to live. You only deserve to be shot by my pistol'." According to his lawyer, Al-Arida is being held in a very small cell measuring just two metres by one metre which is monitored 24 hours a day by cameras and prison guards. "The first time he had food since his recapture was Monday. He was prevented from rest and prayers and he does not know what time of day or night it is." Moreover, revealed Mahajneh, his client was handcuffed and wore leg irons during the meeting with his lawyer. Six Israeli prison guards stood behind him throughout the meeting. The prisoner does not know who recaptured the other escapees, but said that Israeli security officers attacked Zakaria Al-Zubiedi. Al-Arida added that he was unaware of the international support for him and the other escapees. He asked his lawyer to thank all the people who supported him and are concerned about his situation. READ: Israel: security forces beat and hospitalise recaptured escapee During the meeting with his lawyer, Al-Arida was able to share some of the details of the escape. "We escapees all did our best not to enter Arab cities in Israel in order not to harm anyone by attracting security forces to the area," he told his lawyer. "We tried to get into the West Bank, but couldn't do it." He admitted that he was primarily responsible for planning and carrying out the "Freedom Tunnel Operation" which started in December last year. "There were no other prisoners helping those who escaped," he insisted. His recapture, he said, was "accidental"; nobody reported them. "We were detected accidently. A police patrol passed the area where we were hiding and a policeman saw us accidently." The escapees carried a small radio, through which they were able to follow up what was happening around them. Israel launched its largest-ever manhunt in the bid to recapture the six men, whose escape was a huge embarrassment for the occupation state.

News article:
RAMALLAH, West Bank — Lawyers for two Palestinian security prisoners who were captured after escaping from an Israeli prison last week said Wednesday that their clients were badly beaten during their arrest, with the most well-known of the prisoners, Zakaria Zubeidi, suffering a broken jaw and two broken ribs while in handcuffs. Police said Zubeidi resisted arrest, and had to be subdued by force, and also that he was injured in the course of the jailbreak. Six Palestinian prisoners, five of whom have been accused of deadly attacks against Israelis, tunneled out of a maximum-security prison in northern Israel on September 6, in the first mass prison break in decades. Four were recaptured around five days later, apparently while hiding outdoors. The escape from Gilboa prison in northern Israel exposed a series of security blunders and mishaps and was hailed by Palestinians as a show of defiance against Israel. Two of the prisoners are still at large. Lawyers were able to meet with the recaptured prisoners for the first time late Tuesday and early Wednesday, providing the first opportunity to hear of the escape from the prisoners themselves, rather than Israeli officials and media reports. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms A veteran Israeli human rights lawyer representing Zubeidi — a notorious commander in Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade terror group who was in prison while on trial for two dozen crimes including attempted murder — said that the security personnel who arrested him handcuffed him and then asked his name. “He said Zakaria, and then he was beaten very badly,” Avigdor Feldman told The Associated Press. Israel police denied the allegation. Feldman said that Zubeidi was taken to a hospital where he was given painkillers for the fractures in his jaw and two ribs. Feldman said that there were no further abuses during days of interrogation. Advertisement A lawyer for Mohammed al-Arida, who was captured along with Zubeidi, said that his client was beaten during his arrest before being taken to a nearby police station, where he was stripped naked and subjected to hours of interrogation. The lawyer, Khaled Mahajneh, told the local Al-Jarmaq news outlet that his client has a visible head wound and has been continuously interrogated since then with little sleep. “He doesn’t even know what day it is,” Mahajneh said. Israeli police declined to comment. The Shin Bet internal security service, which is currently holding the recaptured prisoners, did not respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for the escapees described a far less sophisticated plot than initially suspected, saying that their clients had no plan for what to do once they tunneled out of the prison. They said that the escapees did not seek help from local Arab residents to avoid getting them into trouble with authorities and were not given any outside assistance. Instead, they kept to rural areas and tried to live off the land, eating wild fruit and waiting for things to settle down. Israeli officials have said that the escapees sought help from local Arab residents, including with transportation to the West Bank, but were rebuffed. Advertisement “They didn’t have any intention to commit any kind of terrorist attack,” Feldman said. The lawyer for Mahmoud al-Arida, another recaptured prisoner, said that his client was the architect of the escape and that work on the tunnel began last December. The six prisoners went to a mosque in a nearby village after the escape and then split into three groups, the lawyer, Raslan Mahajneh, told Palestine TV. He said that they tried to enter the West Bank but were unable to because of the heavy Israeli security presence along the frontier. He said that his client was being interrogated for up to eight hours a day but was not tortured or deprived of sleep. Mohammed al-Arida and Zubeidi grew exhausted after they were unable to find water, leading to their arrest, Arida’s lawyer said. The two were found hiding in a truck parking lot in the Arab town of Umm al-Ghanam. The other two were arrested hours earlier in the nearby Arab city of Nazareth. Israeli media have reported that local residents tipped off police, leading to the capture of the four prisoners. The lawyers for the Aridas disputed that, saying security forces stumbled on them by chance. Palestinians have celebrated the escape and held demonstrations in support of the escapees. Four of the six escaped prisoners, including the Aridas, were serving life sentences after being convicted on terrorism charges by Israeli military courts. All six were members of the Islamic Jihad militant group except for Zubeidi. Feldman said that Zubeidi, who is awaiting trial on terrorism charges dating back to the height of the Second Intifada uprising, was only invited to take part in the escape two days before it happened and did not expect it to succeed. “He was amazed at how easy it was to escape,” Feldman said.

News article:
Lawyers for two Palestinians who were captured after escaping from an Israeli prison last week have said their clients were badly beaten during their arrest, with the most well-known of the prisoners suffering a broken jaw and two broken ribs while in handcuffs. Six Palestinian prisoners, five of whom have been accused of deadly attacks against Israelis, tunneled out of a maximum-security prison in northern Israel on Sept. 6 in the first mass prison break in decades. Four were recaptured around five days later, apparently while hiding outdoors. The escape from Gilboa prison in northern Israel exposed a series of security mishaps and was hailed by Palestinians as a show of defiance against Israel's half-century occupation of territories they want for a future state. Two of the prisoners are still at large. Lawyers were able to meet with the recaptured prisoners for the first time late Tuesday and early Wednesday, providing the first opportunity to hear of the escape from the prisoners themselves, rather than Israeli officials and media reports. A veteran Israeli human rights lawyer representing Zakaria Zubeidi, a well-known militant accused of deadly attacks during the 2000-2005 uprising against Israel, said the security personnel who arrested him handcuffed him and then asked his name. "He said Zakaria, and then he was beaten very badly," Avigdor Feldman told The Associated Press. He said Zubeidi was taken to a hospital where he was given painkillers for the fractures in his jaw and two ribs. Feldman said there were no further abuses during days of interrogation. A lawyer for Mohammed Aradeh, who was captured along with Zubeidi, said his client was beaten during his arrest before being taken to a nearby police station, where he was stripped naked and subjected to hours of interrogation. The lawyer, Khaled Mahajneh, told the local Al-Jarmaq news outlet that his client has a visible head wound and has been continuously interrogated since then with little sleep. "He doesn't even know what day it is," Mahajneh said. Israeli police declined to comment. The Shin Bet internal security service, which is currently holding the recaptured prisoners, did not respond to requests for comment. Israeli security forces have been accused of torturing high-profile prisoners in the past, most recently in 2019 after a deadly bombing in the West Bank. The Shin Bet said at the time that interrogations are carried out in accordance with the law. A 1999 Supreme Court ruling forbids torture, but rights groups say it still occurs and that perpetrators are rarely held accountable. Lawyers for the escapees described a far less sophisticated plot than initially suspected, saying their clients had no plan for what to do once they tunneled out of the prison. They said the escapees did not seek help from local Arab residents to avoid getting them into trouble with authorities and were not given any outside assistance. Instead, they kept to rural areas and tried to live off the land, eating wild fruit and waiting for things to settle down. "They didn't have any intention to commit any kind of terrorist attack," Feldman said. The lawyer for Mahmoud Aradeh, another recaptured prisoner, said his client was the architect of the escape and that work on the tunnel began last December. The six prisoners went to a mosque in a nearby village after the escape and then split into three groups, the lawyer, Raslan Mahajneh told Palestine TV. He said they tried to enter the occupied West Bank but were unable to because of the heavy Israeli security presence along the frontier. He said his client was being interrogated for up to eight hours a day but was not tortured or deprived of sleep. Aradeh and Zubeidi grew exhausted after they were unable to find water, leading to their arrest, Aradeh's lawyer said. The two were found hiding in a truck parking lot in the Arab town of Umm al-Ghanam. The other two were arrested hours earlier in the nearby Arab city of Nazareth. Israeli media have reported that local residents tipped off police, leading to the capture of the four prisoners. But the lawyers for the Aradehs disputed that, saying security forces stumbled on them by chance. The Aradehs are cousins. It was not clear if their lawyers are also related. Palestinians have celebrated the escape and held demonstrations in support of the prisoners. Taking part in attacks against the Israeli military or even civilians is a source of pride for many Palestinians, who view it as legitimate resistance to military occupation. Israel considers it terrorism and typically hands down heavy sentences, even in cases where attacks are thwarted or unsuccessful. Four of the six escaped prisoners, including the Aradehs, were serving life sentences after being convicted on terrorism charges by Israeli military courts, which most Palestinians view as biased and illegitimate. All were members of the Islamic Jihad militant group except for Zubeidi, who is affiliated with the secular Fatah movement. Feldman said Zubeidi, who is awaiting trial on terrorism charges dating back to the height of the uprising, was only invited to take part in the escape two days before it happened and did not expect it to succeed. "He was amazed at how easy it was to escape," he said.

News article:
Lawyers for two Palestinians who were captured after escaping from an Israeli prison last week have said their clients were badly beaten during their arrest, with the most well-known of the prisoners suffering a broken jaw and two broken ribs while in handcuffs. Six Palestinian prisoners, five of whom have been accused of deadly attacks against Israelis, tunneled out of a maximum-security prison in northern Israel on Sept. 6 in the first mass prison break in decades. Four were recaptured around five days later, apparently while hiding outdoors. The escape from Gilboa prison in northern Israel exposed a series of security mishaps and was hailed by Palestinians as a show of defiance against Israel's half-century occupation of territories they want for a future state. Two of the prisoners are still at large. Lawyers were able to meet with the recaptured prisoners for the first time late Tuesday and early Wednesday, providing the first opportunity to hear of the escape from the prisoners themselves, rather than Israeli officials and media reports. A veteran Israeli human rights lawyer representing Zakaria Zubeidi, a well-known militant accused of deadly attacks during the 2000-2005 uprising against Israel, said the security personnel who arrested him handcuffed him and then asked his name. "He said Zakaria, and then he was beaten very badly," Avigdor Feldman told The Associated Press. He said Zubeidi was taken to a hospital where he was given painkillers for the fractures in his jaw and two ribs. Feldman said there were no further abuses during days of interrogation. A lawyer for Mohammed Aradeh, who was captured along with Zubeidi, said his client was beaten during his arrest before being taken to a nearby police station, where he was stripped naked and subjected to hours of interrogation. The lawyer, Khaled Mahajneh, told the local Al-Jarmaq news outlet that his client has a visible head wound and has been continuously interrogated since then with little sleep. "He doesn't even know what day it is," Mahajneh said. Israeli police declined to comment. The Shin Bet internal security service, which is currently holding the recaptured prisoners, did not respond to requests for comment. Israeli security forces have been accused of torturing high-profile prisoners in the past, most recently in 2019 after a deadly bombing in the West Bank. The Shin Bet said at the time that interrogations are carried out in accordance with the law. A 1999 Supreme Court ruling forbids torture, but rights groups say it still occurs and that perpetrators are rarely held accountable. Lawyers for the escapees described a far less sophisticated plot than initially suspected, saying their clients had no plan for what to do once they tunneled out of the prison. They said the escapees did not seek help from local Arab residents to avoid getting them into trouble with authorities and were not given any outside assistance. Instead, they kept to rural areas and tried to live off the land, eating wild fruit and waiting for things to settle down. "They didn't have any intention to commit any kind of terrorist attack," Feldman said. The lawyer for Mahmoud Aradeh, another recaptured prisoner, said his client was the architect of the escape and that work on the tunnel began last December. The six prisoners went to a mosque in a nearby village after the escape and then split into three groups, the lawyer, Raslan Mahajneh told Palestine TV. He said they tried to enter the occupied West Bank but were unable to because of the heavy Israeli security presence along the frontier. He said his client was being interrogated for up to eight hours a day but was not tortured or deprived of sleep. Aradeh and Zubeidi grew exhausted after they were unable to find water, leading to their arrest, Aradeh's lawyer said. The two were found hiding in a truck parking lot in the Arab town of Umm al-Ghanam. The other two were arrested hours earlier in the nearby Arab city of Nazareth. Israeli media have reported that local residents tipped off police, leading to the capture of the four prisoners. But the lawyers for the Aradehs disputed that, saying security forces stumbled on them by chance. The Aradehs are cousins. It was not clear if their lawyers are also related. Palestinians have celebrated the escape and held demonstrations in support of the prisoners. Taking part in attacks against the Israeli military or even civilians is a source of pride for many Palestinians, who view it as legitimate resistance to military occupation. Israel considers it terrorism and typically hands down heavy sentences, even in cases where attacks are thwarted or unsuccessful. Four of the six escaped prisoners, including the Aradehs, were serving life sentences after being convicted on terrorism charges by Israeli military courts, which most Palestinians view as biased and illegitimate. All were members of the Islamic Jihad militant group except for Zubeidi, who is affiliated with the secular Fatah movement. Feldman said Zubeidi, who is awaiting trial on terrorism charges dating back to the height of the uprising, was only invited to take part in the escape two days before it happened and did not expect it to succeed. "He was amazed at how easy it was to escape," he said.

News article:
Israel says its forces have arrested the two remaining Palestinian prisoners, who escaped from a high-security jail nearly two weeks ago. The Israeli ministry of military affairs said early on Sunday that Iham Kamamji and Munadil Nafiyat, both members of the Islamic Jihad resistance movement, were apprehended in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin. It said the two Palestinians “were caught alive”, surrendering without resistance after troops encircled the building where they were hiding. Fouad Kamamji, Iham’s father, told the Associated Press that his son had called him when the Israeli troops surrounded the house and said he would surrender “in order not to endanger the house owners.” Palestinian media outlets said there were exchanges of gunfire during the pre-dawn raid by Israeli special forces, but there were no reports of casualties. Two other Palestinians, reportedly Jenin residents, were also arrested in the raid. Kamamji, originally from Kafr Dan village which lies 8 kilometers (4.9 miles) northwest of Jenin, was arrested in 2006 and jailed for life over alleged murder of an Israeli settler. Nafayat has not been charged with a crime other than being a member of the Islamic Jihad movement. He was being held under Israel’s practice of the so-called administrative detention, which allows the regime to imprison suspects without charge. In the predawn hours of September 6, Zakaria Zubeidi, a former commander of the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade in Jenin and five Islamic Jihad members tunneled their way out through their cell’s drainage system and escaped from Gilboa prison. Four of the Islamic Jihad members were serving life sentences. On September 11, Israeli media outlets reported that four of the escapees had been arrested in the northern part of the occupied territories. Hamas has warned Israel of serious consequences amid reports that the regime has launched repressive measures against Palestinian prisoners in the wake of the recent escape. The movement has said the Palestinian nation and resistance fighters will not remain silent in the face of ongoing violations, and that Israeli prison officials will pay a heavy price for their continued torture of Palestinian inmates. Prison authorities keep Palestinian inmates under deplorable conditions lacking proper hygienic standards. The prisoners have also been subjected to systematic torture, harassment and repression, according to Palestinian officials. Human rights organizations say Israel violates all the rights and freedoms granted to prisoners under the Fourth Geneva Convention. There are reportedly more than 7,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Hundreds of the inmates have been apparently incarcerated under the practice of administrative detention. ‘Israel would at last free all six Palestinian escapees itself’ Resistance movements Hamas and Islamic Jihad reacted to the arrests, saying Israeli prison authorities would be ultimately forced to release all the six Palestinian inmates themselves. “We salute the heroes of Operation Freedom Tunnel, and commend them for having proved Palestinians' ability to resist in any situation,” Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said. “The operation will remain as an undeniable proof of the Israeli security service’s fragility and weakness as well as its instability to withstand Palestinians’ strong willpower,” he said. “What these six prisoners did was an act of great heroism. It was an outstanding achievement and will be recorded in the history of the Palestinian nation’s struggle,” Qassem said. He said the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas movement, will place the names of the six Palestinian prisoners at the top of a future prisoner exchange list with Israel. “Israeli prison guards would ultimately open up the doors and set them free themselves. Attempts to free Palestinian prisoners are at the top of the resistance's priorities,” Qassem said. Prominent Islamic Jihad leader Sheikh Khader Adnan said, “Israel’s re-arrest of the six Palestinian escapees and subsequent imprisonment will never dim the inmates’ glory and victory.” Adnan stressed that the arrests will not erase the humiliating defeat that the Tel Aviv regime suffered. The senior Islamic Jihad leader also called on all Palestinians to support prisoners, especially those being held in solitary confinement, those subjected to torture and those who have gone on hunger strike. “Do whatever you can for the freedom, honor and dignity of the 4,600 prisoners! It is an obligation for our nation and all freedom-loving people of the world,” Adnan said.

News article:
Palestinian Munadel Infeiat, 26, one of the six prisoners who had tunnelled out of Israel's high security Gilboa Prison, is surrounded by Israeli forces as he appears at the magistrates' court in the northern Israeli city of Nazareth on Sunday (AFP photo) OCCUPIED JERUSALEM — All six Palestinians who escaped an Israeli high-security jail through a tunnel dug under a sink are back in custody, after the forces said on Sunday they had recaptured the last two. The inmates, who were being held for attacks against Israel, became heroes among many Palestinians when reports emerged they had burrowed out using tools as basic as a spoon. The full weight of Israel's security apparatus was deployed to catch them, including aerial drones, road checkpoints and an army mission to Jenin in the occupied West Bank where many of the men grew up. The huge manhunt lasted almost a fortnight, with the first four fugitives recaptured last week. The Israel Defence Forces said on Sunday the remaining two had surrendered "after being surrounded by security forces" that had acted with precision on accurate intelligence. The men, 35-year-old Ayham Kamamji and 26-year-old Munadel Infeiat, are both members of Islamic Jihad, an armed Palestinian Islamist movement. Islamic Jihad hailed its "heroes" following the re-arrests, vowing the Palestinian people "will not surrender" in response to Israeli "criminality and aggression". The pair were arrested in a joint operation with counterterrorism forces in Jenin and were "currently being interrogated", the Israeli forces statement said. Two other men who had allegedly helped the fugitives were also detained, it added. 'Major mishap' Taleb Abo Jaafar, who owns the Jenin house in which the two fugitives were found, said he had been surprised to discover his home cordoned off in the middle of the night. "There was shooting around the house. I went out to see what happened, I opened the door and looked at the street, the forces were outside and they told me to go back inside," he told AFP. In a call on Sunday with Israeli security chiefs, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett branded the escape "a major mishap". “But you mobilised with joint forces until the mission was completed,” he added, vowing in a separate statement that the security establishment would “correct what needs to be corrected”. All six fugitives were members of Palestinian groups who were convicted by Israeli courts of plotting or carrying out attacks against Israelis. Kamamji, originally from Kafr Dan near Jenin, was arrested in 2006 and jailed for life for the kidnap and murder of a young Israeli settler, Eliahu Asheri. Islamic Jihad said Kamamji suffered abdominal and intestinal illness in jail and was subject to “medical negligence” by prison authorities. Infeiat, arrested last year, had been jailed multiple times previously for his role in the armed group, and was awaiting sentencing at the time of the escape. Hiding in lorry park The other four men recaptured last week included Mahmoud Abdullah Ardah, the alleged mastermind of the escape, and Zakaria Zubeidi, who headed the armed wing of the Fateh movement of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Zubeidi was found hiding in a lorry park just outside Nazareth in northern Israel along with one of the other men, Mohammad Ardah, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2002 for his role in Islamic Jihad’s armed wing. The remand of the four was extended at Nazareth’s magistrates’ court to September 29 in a Sunday hearing, police said. ‘Spoon of freedom’ Questions remain over how jailbreak could have happened, and a formal inquiry has been announced. A lawyer for Yaqub Qadri, the sixth escapee, told Palestinian television that the inmates had not planned to escape when they did on September 6. She said they rushed ahead with the plan on that day because they feared guards had become suspicious and noticed changes in their cell. The break-out had been planned for months, Ardah’s lawyer told AFP, saying that “Mahmoud told me he started digging in December”. Ardah told him he used spoons, plates and even the handle of a kettle to dig the tunnel from his jail cell. Spoons have since become a symbol of Palestinian resistance, with protesters both inside and outside the Palestinian territories carrying them at demonstrations. They have inspired political artwork as far away as Kuwait, where artist Maitham Abdal has sculpted a giant hand clasping what he labelled the “spoon of freedom”.

Palestinian Munadel Infeiat, 26, one of the six prisoners who had tunnelled out of Israel's high security Gilboa Prison, is surrounded by Israeli forces as he appears at the magistrates' court in the northern Israeli city of Nazareth on Sunday (AFP photo) OCCUPIED JERUSALEM — All six Palestinians who escaped an Israeli high-security jail through a tunnel dug under a sink are back in custody, after the forces said on Sunday they had recaptured the last two. The inmates, who were being held for attacks against Israel, became heroes among many Palestinians when reports emerged they had burrowed out using tools as basic as a spoon. The full weight of Israel's security apparatus was deployed to catch them, including aerial drones, road checkpoints and an army mission to Jenin in the occupied West Bank where many of the men grew up. The huge manhunt lasted almost a fortnight, with the first four fugitives recaptured last week. The Israel Defence Forces said on Sunday the remaining two had surrendered "after being surrounded by security forces" that had acted with precision on accurate intelligence. The men, 35-year-old Ayham Kamamji and 26-year-old Munadel Infeiat, are both members of Islamic Jihad, an armed Palestinian Islamist movement. Islamic Jihad hailed its "heroes" following the re-arrests, vowing the Palestinian people "will not surrender" in response to Israeli "criminality and aggression". The pair were arrested in a joint operation with counterterrorism forces in Jenin and were "currently being interrogated", the Israeli forces statement said.

News article:
Public Security Minister Omer Barlev on Friday announced the makeup of a government commission to investigate the escape of six Palestinian prisoners from a high-security facility in northern Israel earlier this month. All six Palestinians who escaped have been recaptured since the jailbreak, considered one of the worst prison escapes in Israel’s history. A statement from Barlev’s office says the panel will be headed by retired judge Menachem Finkelstein, who previously served as deputy head of the Central District Court and chief military prosecutor, among other posts. The commission will also include Prof. Efrat Shoham, a criminologist at Ashkelon Academic College and Arik Barbing, a former senior official in the Shin Bet security service. The statement didn’t specify when the panel was expected to begin its work. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Barlev announced the planned commission days after the jailbreak, vowing to leave “no stone unturned” in investigating the causes of the prison escape. The prisoners, including five Islamic Jihad members and notorious Fatah terrorist Zakaria Zubeidi, escaped from Gilboa Prison in the predawn hours of September 6, making their way out through their cell’s drainage system and an empty space underneath the prison. They had reportedly begun digging in November, using plates, panhandles, building debris and part of a metal hanger, according to various reports. Last week Israel recaptured the final two escapees who spent nearly two weeks on the run. Advertisement Channel 12 news reported Thursday that the space underneath the prison will be filled with cement, using techniques developed by the military to prevent cross-border attack tunnels from the Gaza Strip. The prisons service will also adopt other measures to improve security at Gilboa, including new warning and advanced detection systems that use artificial intelligence, according to the report. The recent escape exposed a series of failures at the prison. Among the apparent lapses were failure to learn lessons from previous escape attempts and several operational blunders, including unmanned watchtowers and sleeping guards.

Israeli authorities yesterday transferred the six Palestinian prisoners who escaped from the Gilboa maximum security prison in early September to solitary confinement in various prisons. Lawyer Khaled Mahajna said in a statement that after occupation forces completed their investigations, they transferred the detainees to solitary confinement in different prisons. Earlier on Wednesday, Mahajna said the six prisoners will be indicted on Sunday, explaining that the legal battle against the security charges will begin. On Wednesday Israeli authorities extended the detention of the six prisoners until Sunday. Five others have been accused of helping the prisoners and covering up their escape. On 6 September the six Palestinian prisoners escaped from the Gilboa maximum security prison, through a tunnel they dug under the prison floor. They were all recaptured within weeks.

News article:
Tel Aviv - Nazir Magally A report on the escape of six Palestinian prisoners from the Gilboa prison in early September has indicated that they likely crumbled the concrete on the floor of the cell using acid or Coca Cola soft drink. The Israeli Army’s Combat Engineering Corps issued a report showing that the escape route of the prisoners included lifting a marble slab in the shower cubicle and digging a tunnel shaft through layers of steel and concrete to the space below. “The prisoners dug a tunnel shaft under a marble slab in the shower cubicle, passing through the top tin (5 mm of steel) and through the ground floor (20 cm of concrete) into the underground space,” the report read. It pointed to the fact that the concrete can be weakened and crumbled over time by using various acids, without the use of special means, “a cola drink can be used.” “The length of the escape tunnel is about 35 meters, 29 meters of which they dug themselves, with an average diameter of 0.5 meters, which includes around 5-6 cubic meters of soil, they gradually disposed through the sewers.” “The excavation material was used to line the excavated route inside the spaces of the link beams, saving the need to evacuate the excavation material into the prison,” it explained. Meanwhile, Israel’s Prison Service (IPS) transferred the prisoners, who will be indicted on Sunday, to solitary confinement in various prisons. According to Karim Ajwa, a lawyer in the Palestinian Authority's Prisoners and Freed Prisoners Committee, Mahmoud al-Ardah has been placed in a small and dirty cell in Ashkelon prison. He is being monitored constantly in solitary confinement, including when he uses the toilet, depriving him of privacy. He is considering a hunger strike if his prison conditions worsen in the coming days, Ajwa stressed. Zakaria Zubeidi is being held in the notorious desert prison of Eshel in the Negev, in southern Israel, Ajwa said, while Ayham Kamةji has been moved to solitary confinement in Ohli Kedar prison, also in the Negev, Yaqoub Qadri to Rimonim prison and Munadel Nfeiat and Mahmoud Abdullah Ardah to Ayalon prison in Ramla.

News article:
By Yoni Weiss YERUSHALAYIM — The Northern District Attorney’s Office filed an indictment with the Nazareth Magistrate’s Court on Sunday against the six prisoners who broke out of the Gilboa Prison on Sept. 6. The failure of the Israel Prisons Service to prevent the breakout overshadowed the Shin Bet’s and IDF’s success at recapturing them within about two weeks and has led to an impending state commission of inquiry. Already there is a high likelihood that the head of Gilboa Prison will be fired, and some have called for the firing of the IPS Chief Katy Perry. The State Attorney’s Office on Wednesday filed a statement of prosecution against the prisoners who escaped, as well as against five additional inmates who aided them. One surprise was that the final filed charges did not contain some of the new terror-related charges which had been leaked to the media by police and security forces but focused solely on the actions of illegal fleeing confinement. Of the six escapees, the most prominent was Zakaria Zubeidi, a Fatah commander who was responsible for multiple terrorist attacks and for killing many Israelis. Munadil Nafayat, Iham Kahamji, Yaquob Qadiri, and brothers Mahmoud and Mohammed al-Arida were the other escapees – all of them members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad and from towns near Jenin. The escape exposed a series of failures at the prison, including that the IPS didn’t learn lessons from a previous escape attempt at the prison, as well as several other major issues. These include sleeping guards, unmanned watchtowers due to a shortage of staff and the sense of boldness security prisoners feel vis-à-vis the guards. The investigation of the incident – the worst jailbreak in Israel’s history – is headed by the Lahav 433 Major Crimes Unit.

News article:
Iranian dissidents are warning of the hard-line regime’s use of drones to cause instability in the region, saying it is using the technology – materials for which are being imported from China – to make up for the weaknesses of its air force. The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an umbrella group of Iranian resistance groups that oppose the regime, released evidence in a press conference it says shows the production and utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UACs) for terrorist operations and for assisting its proxies in the Middle East – including aerial photographs of the alleged sites and details that have emerged from inside the country. STATE DEPARTMENT FRUSTRATED BY IRAN STONEWALLING ON NUCLEAR TALKS "Our revelation today is significant because it shows that the Qods Force of the IRGC has in recent years expanded its arsenal to step up terrorism and warmongering to destabilize the region by arming its proxies with UAVs," Alireza Jafarzadeh, deputy director of the Washington office of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, told Fox News. "This is in line with the regime’s nuclear defiance and its repression at home." The group alleges that the regime, which has been rocked by a slew of economic sanctions imposed by the Trump administration as well as protests at home and challenges related to its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, has used a web of industries to spend billions of dollars to produce components or smuggle them in from foreign countries. The NCRI report alleges that at least one of the operations, Ghazanfar Roknabadi Industries, provides support and training for International Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) factories and uses raw materials that are imported from the Chinese communist regime. The findings by the group also show that a new drone complex, with a specialized drone unit, has been set up in Semnan since 2019 -- which includes work on reproduction of light and quiet drones. The drones are then transported in pieces and moved as part of an effort to control the country’s borders. Those are two of the factories the NCRI claims is being used as part of the drone project and a project that also includes the regime’s UAV Command -- which is one of the branches of the regime’s air force. AS IRANIAN LEADER RAISI ADDRESSES UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY, DISSIDENTS CALL FOR PRESSURE ON REGIME All in all, it identifies eight alleged UAV manufacturing bases and seven more for maintenance and other services -- while the Quds forces is working to make sure that the drone program equips proxies in the region, including in Yemen, Syria and Lebanon, with the advanced technology. Those drones have been used in a variety of ways, including to identify and attack Syrian opposition forces and to help Houthis in Yemen use drones in their attacks against Saudi-backed forces. The group also says that the IRGC has made "extensive use of drones inside Iraq" to militant groups, such as the Al-Nujaba group -- which have reportedly displayed its UAV capabilities during parades. The NCRI, which has long called for a democratic and secular Iran, calls on countries not to lift any further sanctions on the regime until it stops its aggressive behavior. "It is time for the U.S., Europe, and the countries of the region to adopt a firm policy by expanding sanctions, and holding [President Ebrahim] Raisi and [Ayatollah] Khamenei to account until Tehran abandons its rogue behavior and ends human rights violations," Jafarzadeh said.

News article:
Chief Commander of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Major General Hossein Salami says the naval units of his forces will be armed with cruise missiles with an operational range of up to 2,000 kilometers and capable of targeting moving vessels in the near future. During a Friday visit to IRGC naval units based in the Persian Gulf islands and the Strait of Hormuz, Major General Salami hailed the IRGC navy’s defensive and offensive capabilities, especially in the field of navigation, and said the force has made a great achievement by increasing the velocity of its speedboats to nearly one hundred knots per hour. He added that the IRGC navy has made considerable progress in development and manufacture of unmanned aerial vehicles, and now possesses hundreds of reconnaissance, surveillance, combat and kamikaze drones with different operational ranges of up to 1,200 kilometers (745 miles). The IRGC navy force, he said, will continue to increase the range of its drones. The IRGC navy also currently has missiles with various ranges of 35, 90, 300 and 700 kilometers in its inventory. “In near future, the naval force will be armed with cruise missiles with a range of 2,000 kilometers, and capable of targeting moving vessels,” the IRGC chief said. General Salami went on to say that the IRGC navy has developed various signal collection systems, jammers and electronic warfare systems, and that the hardware expanded both defensive and offensive capabilities of the force. Commander of the Valiasr Drone Unit of the Army, Brigadier General Shahram Hassannejad, also praised the homegrown technology of Iranian drones, stating that such a feature has eased their design, production, application and overhaul. He told IRNA in an interview published on Saturday that the capabilities of Iranian unmanned aircraft have improved tremendously in recent years, and they are now equipped with state-of-the-art technology and enjoy sophisticated combat tactics. “What makes Iranian drones a game changer in the region and the world is their indigenousness. It means we have utilized completely homegrown technology in their production, use and overhaul. We are not dependent on any country in terms of drone production, and can simply replace them,” he said. He added, “Iranian drones have also been designed and built in accordance with climate and strategic characteristics of their operational zones. Iran has different weather conditions, and our drones can perform their missions over seas, mountains and desert areas.” Brigadier General Hassannejad said the US Central Command (CENTCOM) has acknowledged the aerial superiority of Iran in the region due to its large fleet of combat drones. Iranian military experts and technicians have in recent years made great progress in developing and manufacturing a broad range of domestically-manufactured equipment, making the armed forces self-sufficient in this regard. Iranian officials have repeatedly underscored that the Islamic Republic will not hesitate to build up its defense capabilities, emphasizing such abilities are entirely meant for the purpose of defense and will be never subject to negotiations.

News article:
Israeli F-15 fighter jets escorted an American heavy bomber through the region as it made its way to the Persian Gulf on Saturday, in an apparent threat to Iran. “The flight represents the continued operational cooperation with American forces in the region,” the Israel Defense Forces said. The escort mission came as Israeli and American officials have increasingly threatened to act against Tehran’s nuclear program, as Iran has stalled indirect negotiations with the United States in Vienna regarding a mutual return to the 2015 nuclear deal. The Israeli military shared photographs and video footage of the flight, showing the American B-1b bomber, which is capable of carrying heavy bunker-buster bombs that would be needed for a strike on Iran’s largely underground nuclear facilities, alongside the Israeli F-15 jets. Israeli officials have explicitly threatened a military strike on Iran’s nuclear program, while Americans have discussed the matter more circumspectly, referring to “other options” beyond diplomatic negotiations in order to halt Tehran’s atomic aspirations.

The joint flight illustrates the continued strategic cooperation of the IDF with the United States in the area. pic.twitter.com/bD38bLt9dK Advertisement — Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) October 30, 2021 In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett declared that “Iran’s nuclear program has hit a watershed moment, and so has our tolerance. Words do not stop centrifuges from spinning… We will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.” The Times of Israel has learned that the Israeli Air Force plans to begin simulating strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities in the coming months and that some aspects of the Israeli Air Force’s strike plan, which is still in the “draft” stage, could be ready within a short period of time, while others would take more than a year to be fully actionable. Israel has twice conducted airstrikes on enemy nations’ nuclear programs, bombing Iraq’s nuclear reactor in 1981 and Syria’s in 2007. However, an attack on Iran’s nuclear program is widely expected to be far, far more complicated as Tehran has spread out its facilities throughout the country, buried them deep underground, and funded a number of powerful proxies throughout the region who would likely retaliate against Israel if such a strike should be carried out.

In a statement signed by US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the G20 conference in Rome on Saturday, the leaders put more pressure on Iran’s new president, Ebrahim Rais, warning the world of “the risks posed to international security by Iran’s escalating nuclear program.” Also on rt.com Israel claims ‘right’ to strike Iran ‘at any moment’ to prevent it from obtaining nukes, FM Lapid says after meeting with Blinken Think your friends would be interested?

News article:
JEDDAH: Saudi fighter jets escorted a US Air Force strategic bomber in a “show of strength” over key waterways in the Middle East, US military chiefs said on Sunday. The B-1B Lancer passed over the Arabian Gulf, the Bab Al-Mandeb strait, the Suez Canal, the Gulf of Omanand the Strait of Hormuz. It was also accompanied by military aircraft from Egypt, Bahrain and Israel. “The bomber task force mission ... was intended to deliver a clear message of reassurance,” said Centcom commander Gen. Frank McKenzie, the head of US forces in the Middle East. “Military readiness for any contingency or mission, from crisis response to multilateral exercises to one-day presence patrols like this, depends on reliable partnerships.” The B-1B is a supersonic bomber that can carry the heaviest conventional payload of all the US military’s planes. A US B-52 bomber, also capable of carrying nuclear weapons, flew over the Middle East in January. Since February, Iran and Israel have engaged in what analysts have called a “shadow war,” in which vessels linked to each nation have come under attack in waters around the Gulf in tit-for-tat exchanges. The regional patrol, Centcom's fifth such operation this year, comes as talks aimed at reviving the 2015 deal to limit Iran’s nuclear program have stalled. US President Joe Biden has offered to return to the nuclear accord, but his administration has voiced growing frustration over delays after a hard-line government took office in Iran. Donald Trump withdrew the US from the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions, and Iran has stepped upnuclear enrichment.

Topic: Great Power Competition Region: World Blog Brand: The Reboot Tags: U.S. Air ForceB-1B-1 BomberChinaRussia Strategic bombers send a message to friend and foe alike. Here's What You Need to Know: Strategic bombers can assure allies and partners while deterring near-peer competitors. Air Force B-1 bombers have gone to India and Norway as part of the service’s massively stepped-up Bomber Task Force (BTF) global operations, intended to further solidify international partnerships, interoperability and conduct high-impact deterrence missions intended to reassure U.S. allies amid ongoing threats posed by Russia and China. Bomber Task Forces, a longstanding U.S. Air Force practice, are expanding in size, scope and frequency, often extending to less visited parts of the globe such as the Arctic and parts of Western Asia. These Task Forces often include B-1s, B-52 and B-2 to demonstrate force and resolve, particularly in high-threat contested areas such as the South China Sea area parts of Eastern Europe. “I’m pleased with the way we have approached it to get to places around the globe and show presence for partners and allies. We have implemented leaner logistics and faster turn times and done some good experiments. We are working with our partners and allies and putting a lot of focus on the Pacific and Europe to give us more reach. We have the highest bomber aircrew readiness in the history of the command,” said General Timothy Ray, Air Force Global Strike Command Commander. B-1 bombers in Norway introduce new patrol opportunities to show force and presence in the Arctic region which is increasingly contested by major power rivals. Competitors such as Russia and China are looking to expand influence, gather or harvest natural resources and, perhaps most of all, gain unparalleled strategic advantage by establishing a tactical footprint with quick access to virtually all parts of the Northern Hemisphere. Also, places like the South China Sea in the Pacific may present new opportunities for smaller, shorter, more targeted and tactically relevant BTFs, particularly in and around island areas where China continues to increase operation. “We are looking more aggressively beyond the current list of locations. Small scale short deployments give us different options,” Ray said. Interestingly, Ray’s strategic emphasis is already taking to the sky, as the U.S. Central Command just sent two B-52H Stratofortress bombers flying through vital parts of the Middle East in what is seen as a warning message to Iran. It was the fourth bomber deployment into the Middle East already just this year. “Multiple partner nations and U.S. Air Force fighter aircraft accompanied the U.S. bombers at different points during the flight, including Israel, Saudi Arabia and Qatar,” a statement from U.S. Central Command said. As part of his discussion about Bomber Task Forces, Ray referred to the re-engineering of the B-52 as well as the addition of new radar and cruise missiles to the platform such as the emerging Air Launched Rapid Response (ARRW) hypersonic weapon. “We have done some flight tests on ARRW and plan to do more tests later this year,” Ray added. Precision targeting, a new generation of networking technologies and upgraded weapons systems also bring new opportunities for deterrence. For instance, bombers can now much more quickly and efficiently receive and integrate new threat data or intelligence information while in route. Point to point communications between ground command and control centers, ships, air assets and even nearby drones can operate in a dispersed, widely disaggregated way, yet still sustain high levels of secure connectivity. B-52 mission pilots, for example, don’t have to merely load target coordinates up into a database prior to flight but can also receive new ones in near real-time should intelligence change on the ground. Therefore, not only do potential adversaries know the precision-target devastation bombers could inflict in the event of war, but they are also increasingly aware that modern bombers can hold much larger areas at risk and overcome many standard enemy countermeasures.

Osborn previously served at the Pentagon as a Highly Qualified Expert with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army—Acquisition, Logistics & Technology.

News article:
The Iranian military announced it would begin Sunday a large-scale exercise in the Gulf of Oman, the northern part of the Indian Ocean, and in sections of the Red Sea, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency. The news agency quoted Adm. Habibollah Sayyari, Iran’s deputy army chief, as saying the drill will be a demonstration of Iran’s power at sea, “warning the enemies that any act of aggression against Iran will draw a crushing response from the army.” The drill, dubbed “Zolfaqar-1400,” will involve forces from the Iranian Army Ground Forces, Navy, Air Force, and Air Defense units, Sayyari said in a press conference Saturday, according to Tasnim. It is expected to cover an area of over one million square kilometers (386,102 square miles) southeast of Iran, stretching from the eastern side of the Strait of Hormuz to the northern part of the Indian Ocean, as well as part of the Red Sea, the army general said. It was not clear what areas in the Red Sea would be included in the exercise.

The general stated that the drill is also aimed at raising the combat and defense capabilities of the various units “for protecting the country’s territorial integrity,” according to Tasnim. Iran regularly holds such drills and says they assess the troops’ combat readiness and demonstrate the nation’s military capabilities. Advertisement The region remains on edge over Iran’s escalating nuclear program. The 2015 nuclear deal saw Tehran drastically limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. In 2018, then-United States president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord, raising tensions across the wider Middle East. Sunday’s drill comes as nuclear negotiations between Iran and world powers are to resume on November 29. Iran has breached limits set by the nuclear deal and is enriching small amounts of uranium to its closest-ever levels to weapons-grade purity as its stockpile continues to grow. Iran claims its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes. Talks began in April in Vienna between Tehran and the remaining five parties to the 2015 deal, aimed at bringing Washington back into the agreement. But that dialogue has been stalled since the sixth round of talks in June, when ultraconservative Ebrahim Raisi won Iran’s presidential election.

The US military reportedly used several helicopter gunships and warships in the attack. According to reports, they stopped the Iranian tanker and the crew of the US ship began to transfer oil to its own tanker. In Tehran, it was described as an attempt to "steal Iranian oil."On the same day, a video was released that depicts forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps preventing the US military from its purported interception of the Iranian tanker's cargo.US officials have dismissed the accusations, saying they are “absolutely totally false and untrue.” According to Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby, the allegation may have been prompted by a different incident, which happened on 24 October, when “US Navy assets did monitor Iranian forces illegally boarding and seizing a merchant vessel in international waters in the Gulf of Oman." iran arabian sea gulf of oman Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60 2021 Alexandra Kashirina Alexandra Kashirina News en_EN Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60 1920 1080 true 1920 1440 true 1920 1920 true Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60 Alexandra Kashirina rear admiral habibollah sayyari, iranian military drills, naval drills in arabian sea

In Tehran, it was described as an attempt to "steal Iranian oil."On the same day, a video was released that depicts forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps preventing the US military from its purported interception of the Iranian tanker's cargo.US officials have dismissed the accusations, saying they are “absolutely totally false and untrue.” According to Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby, the allegation may have been prompted by a different incident, which happened on 24 October, when “US Navy assets did monitor Iranian forces illegally boarding and seizing a merchant vessel in international waters in the Gulf of Oman." iran arabian sea gulf of oman Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60 2021 Alexandra Kashirina Alexandra Kashirina News en_EN Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60 1920 1080 true 1920 1440 true 1920 1920 true Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60 Alexandra Kashirina rear admiral habibollah sayyari, iranian military drills, naval drills in arabian sea

News article:
Topic: China Blog Brand: The Buzz Tags: ChinaASBMCarrier Killer MissilesArleigh Burke-classFord-ClassAircraft Carrier China is all set up to do target practice in the desert—on replicas of American vessels like aircraft carriers. Why? Photos taken by satellite imagery company Maxar on November 7, 2021, on behalf of the U.S. Naval Institute reveal that China has built an accurate mock-up of the deck (but not the island superstructure and other equipment) of a Ford-class aircraft carrier at a missile test range in the Taklamakan desert in western Xinjiang Province. Also spotted were highly detailed replicas of two U.S. Arleigh-Burke-class guided-missile destroyers and at least two more carrier-shaped targets, as well as a seventy-five-meter-long ship-like target mounted on six-meter wide rails. You can see the satellite imagery combined in this graphic published by Reuters. These efforts are almost certainly so the test range can offer more realistic practice targets for China’s growing arsenal of anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs). These weapons, which unlike the more widely used naval cruise loft high into space before plunging down at incredible speeds, have cast a long shadow in military competition between the U.S. and China since Beijing first unveiled its DF-21D “carrier killer” missile in 2009. The DF-21D, which itself is mounted on a mobile truck launcher making it harder to kill preemptively, has a maximum range exceeding nine hundred miles. That means it could threaten to heavily damage or destroy powerful U.S. Navy supercarriers from well beyond the attack range of its onboard warplanes. Since then, China has unveiled several more ASBM-type missiles: the DF-26B which may have a range of up to 2,500 miles—meaning it could sink ships at the U.S. naval base in Guam—and several shorter-range ASBM missiles seemingly intended for export (M20B, CM-401, BP-12B). China is reportedly planning to deploy ASBMs on its H-6 strategic bombers and Type 055 missile cruisers. The mockups at the Taklamakan site are not China’s first carrier-like practice targets—a crude concrete pad had been used as a practice target at Shuangchengzi since 2003 and a mockup near the current site was targeted in missile tests in 2013. However, the new mockups are much more detailed representations of U.S. Navy vessels. According to USNI, the current equipment was first erected and then dismantled in 2019—only to be reassembled in September 2021 per historical satellite imagery. Extensive instrumentation is visible at the new site to collect data on missile strikes, but no impact craters are visible, suggesting the site hasn’t been put to use yet for missile tests. Why China Is Testing Anti-Ship Missiles in a Desert Despite their formidable speed and reach, ASBMs have never been used in combat before, and there’s debate over just how reliable they would prove at hitting moving targets using their terminal infrared- or radar-guidance seekers. U.S. carriers and destroyers typically maintain high speeds of thirty knots, and once alerted to a missile launch (the launch flash can likely be detected from space) would seek to change course and exit the kill box the missile’s seeker can scan. Thus, to be effective the seeker must either scan a broad enough area and be able to discriminate between desirable and undesirable targets, and/or it should receive midcourse targeting adjustments from friendly surveillance assets tracking the target vessel—say, a submarine, drone, or maritime patrol plane. The first reports of Chinese tests against a carrier-like target were reported in January 2013 by Want China Times. These were supported by satellite photos showing two craters blasted into a carrier-like structure measuring 200 meters in length. It wasn’t until six years later, China finally had DF-21D and DF-26B test-fired successfully at moving maritime targets near the Paracel Islands. China’s apparent return to land-based ASBM target tests is likely intended to limit the controversy and observability of tests in the open commons of the Pacific Ocean. In other words, the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force didn’t want the U.S. military collecting nearly as much data from its missile tests as China did. The land-based tests may also prove less expensive or logistically complicated to orchestrate, and the smaller rail-based target may allow missile units to repeatedly practice striking a moving target. Meanwhile, a more detailed rendering of the Ford-class’s deck shape and the superstructure on the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer may also test the seeker’s ability to acquire and identify those target profiles. On the downside, the surrounding desert environment will create different discrimination challenges for both radar and infrared seekers than a vessel would at sea, so it’s not a completely satisfactory substitute. Furthermore, while accuracy against moving targets may be a necessity for Chinese ASBMs to be effective, is not by itself sufficient. That’s because ASBMs are highly visible both to radar and infrared sensors, and the U.S. Navy has been introducing countermeasures against the threat for over a decade, notably including SM-3 anti-ballistic missile interceptors, as well as electronic warfare and other countermeasures to disrupt missile guidance. Skeptics of Chinese ASBMs also argue that China lacks robust enough maritime surveillance capabilities to reliably detect and track ships at sea necessary to cue missile attacks. Remember, the missile units require communication with naval, aerial, and space-based surveillance platforms to know when and where to lob their missiles. In a conflict, the U.S. forces would certainly do their utmost to disrupt or destroy the spotters and their communication links with both electronic warfare and kinetic attacks. However, this argument is growing less convincing as China has methodically expanded and enhanced its maritime surveillance capabilities with radars deployed on a network of artificial islands, additional satellites launched into space, and new types of robotic spy submarines, surveillance drones, and maritime patrol aircraft. This map, for example, illustrates the many overlapping sensors China can deploy to track ships entering the waters between The Philippines and Vietnam. Regardless, practice against realistic and moving target tests, and forming spotter-shooter kill chains seem like necessary prerequisites before simulating more complex tactics used in combat scenarios against a reactive enemy with air defenses, such as salvo-firing missiles to overwhelm a carrier task force’s air defense capacity. It’s worth noting that—as far we know—China hasn’t yet gone as far as Iran in creating a floating mockup of a U.S. aircraft carrier for target practice. After taking its prescribed pounding in its second outing in July 2020, Iran’s mockup carrier capsized while returning to port. That at least won’t be a problem with China’s desert-based practice targets.

(MENAFN- Nam News Network) TEHRAN, Nov 10 (NNN-IRNA) – The Iranian army intercepted two U.S. drones and warned them to stay away from the zones, where it was carrying out the Zolfaqar-1400 military drills, the army's media bureau said in a statement yesterday. The U.S. aircraft, including MQ-9 and RQ-4 drones, intruded into the country's Flight Information Region and Air Defence Identification Zone during the drills, according to the statement. The drones were approaching to gather intelligence, but they changed their course and flew away after receiving decisive warnings, it said. The Iranian army on Sunday launched a large-scale military exercise on the southern coasts, east of the Strait of Hormuz. During the manoeuvre, attended by ground force, navy, air force and air defence, Iran's army tested locally-developed missiles, torpedoes and unmanned aerial vehicles, according to official reports. The two-day joint exercise was wrapped up yesterday with a naval parade. Iranian army commanders said, the drills aimed at enhancing preparations to ward off threats and sending a message of peace and friendship to regional states.– NNN-IRNA

Topic: Iranian Proxies Region: Middle East Blog Brand: The Reboot Tags: IranNorth KoreaType 73IRGCProxiesYemen North Korea didn't love the Type 73 but Iran does. Here's What You Need to Remember: Western forces on several occasions in recent years have intercepted ships hauling illicit cargoes comprising Type 73s, among other weapons. To trace possible Iranian support for militant forces across the Middle East, look for the telltale silhouette of the Type 73 machine gun. The weapon appears to be a staple of covert Iranian aid to armed groups. The Type 73 is North Korean in origin and first appeared in the 1970s. The 23-pound, 7.62-millimeter weapon blends the basic layout of the Russian PKM machine gun with the feeding system from the Czech Vz.52. “The arrangement allows gunners to load the weapons with belts of ammunition or large magazines,” Joseph Trevithick noted in a 2016 article. “When fitted, the magazines stick out of the top, giving the firearms a distinctly dated appearance.” Small Arms Defense Journal called the Type 73 “probably one of the most unknown mass-produced automatic weapons in the world.” Even within the mist of secrecy regarding North Korean firearms, the Type 73 is still clouded in mystery. Vague pictures showing parts of the Type 73 as soldiers carried them were released from time to time in North Korean propaganda films, but no details were ever released. The Type 73 was occasionally spotted in the surveillance photos taken by South Korean or U.S. forces. The reason for the rarity of sightings is, of course, their obsessive secrecy; so top secret in fact, that most of North Korea’s indigenous weapons have no printed manual. Armorers or mechanics have to learn, memorize, and if one really wants to have some kind of manual to refer to, he has to hand-write one. Manuals like this are one-of-the-kind, and hard to get out of North Korea. The Type 73 was never very popular in North Korean service, and starting in 1982 Pyongyang quickly replaced the weapon with the more-conventional Type 82. But facing a shortage of machine guns during the bloody war with Iraq in the 1980s, Iran imported a large number of Type 73s. “In the years that followed, Iranian factories made improvements and built copies of many of the designs,” Trevithick reported. Tehran now apparently ships those copies to militant groups. “As conflict spread across the Middle East after the Arab Spring in 2011, North Korea stepped up small-arms shipments to Libya and Syria, according to arms researchers,” The Wall Street Journal reported. According to the newspaper, Type 73s have also turned up in battles in Yemen, Iraq and Syria, “likely via Iran.” Western forces on several occasions in recent years have intercepted ships hauling illicit cargoes comprising Type 73s, among other weapons. Armament Research Services in 2016 documented the Type 73 in the hands of several Iran-backed militant groups. Images from Iraq show the Type 73 primarily in the hands of Iraqi Shi’a militias, particularly Badr Brigade forces, which have operated under direction from, and with substantial military support from, Iran. Other groups have also acquired limited examples of the Type 73, including the Al-Imam Ali Brigade and the Christian Babylon Brigades. The Type 73 has also been documented in the hands of the Syrian Arab Army operating near Palmyra, Syria. A recent video from the Al-Masirah channel shows the Type 73 in the hands of a Houthi fighter in Taiz governorate. There are two reasons for the weapon’s new popularity, Trevithick explained. “If Iran is indeed the source, officials probably chose to ship the weapons in the first place simply because they were available. Since the guns use the same cartridges and ammunition belts as the much more common PKM, militants would have little trouble using the Type 73s.” “Soon, the uncommon Type 73 might become much better known to military experts and independent observers. As the fighting in Syria, Iraq and Yemen grinds on, the machine guns might end up a much more common sight in the Middle East and East Africa — and maybe beyond — with or without any direct connection to Iran.” David Axe was Defense Editor of the National Interest.

Topic: Iran Region: Middle East Blog Brand: The Buzz Tags: IranDronesUnmanned AircraftJCPOANegotiations This latest incident between Tehran and Washington comes just weeks before the two countries are set to resume talks to restart the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal. Iranian state media claimed on Tuesday that the Iran military had “warned off” U.S. drones that were operating near an annual exercise at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. The annual Zulfiqar 1400 exercises began on Sunday, east of the Strait of Hormuz, and extended over an area of more than a million square kilometers (around 400,000 square miles) in the Sea of Oman, the Indian Ocean and even into parts of the Red Sea. The war games concluded on Tuesday with a parade of warships that included Iranian submarines. Exactly where the drones were when they were “warned off” hasn’t been entirely established, but the types of unmanned aerial vehicles were noted in a state TV report. “These aircraft [RQ-4 and MQ-9 U.S. drones] changed their route after approaching the borders of the Islamic Republic of Iran following the air defence’s interception and decisive warning,” state media IRIB reported, according to Reuters. The RQ-4 Global Hawk is a high-altitude, remotely piloted, surveillance aircraft that first entered service in 1998. The unmanned aircraft can provide a broad overview and systematic surveillance using its high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and electro-optical/infrared sensors, while it can maintain long loiter times over target areas. As such, the RQ-4 Global Hawk can survey as much as forty thousand square miles one hundred square kilometers of terrain per day, roughly area the size of South Korea or Iceland. Meanwhile, MQ-9 Reaper—also known as the Predator B—UAV is capable of remote control as well as autonomous flight operations. It is a hunter-killer UAV designed for long-endurance, high-altitude surveillance. It first entered service in 2007. The U.S. military operates roughly forty-nine of the RQ-4 Global Hawks and nearly two hundred of the MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aircraft. Series of Incidents Iran has been accused of orchestrating various recent attacks on shipping in the sea lanes serving the Gulf, which is where a large portion of the world’s oil is produced. This latest incident between Tehran and Washington comes just weeks before the two countries are set to resume talks to restart the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal. That would be the first talks regarding the United States’ re-entry into the nuclear deal that former President Donald Trump exited from in 2018. Six previous rounds of indirect negotiations had occurred earlier this year and ended in June when the Islamic Republic elected a new president. It is unlikely that the U.S. strategy will change in the next round of talks. “We have been unambiguous when it comes to our position that there was tremendous progress in rounds one through six in these talks in Vienna,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement, reported by TheHill.com. “It would be neither productive nor wise to take up from any other position from where we left off in June, from the conclusion in the sixth round.” The next round of talks is set to resume in Vienna on November 29.

For the second time in a month, the military said Thursday that Israeli F-15 fighter jets escorted United States B-1 bombers through the region, in a tacit threat to Iran. According to the Israel Defense Forces, the fighter jets accompanied two B-1B heavy bombers and an American KC-10 refueling jet through Israeli airspace as they headed west from the Persian Gulf. “The joint flight demonstrates our continued cooperation, which is crucial to the security of Israel and the Middle East,” the IDF said in a statement. The Israeli military shared photographs of the flight, showing the American bombers — capable of carrying heavy bunker-buster bombs that would be needed for a strike on Iran’s largely underground nuclear facilities — alongside the Israeli F-15 jets. Late last month, Israeli F-15s escorted a B-1B bomber as it made its way to the Gulf.

The exercise comes just over a year after Israel normalized ties with the UAE and Bahrain, a move seen as having been driven in large part by the countries’ shared concerns about Iran and its regional ambitions. Though Israel has conducted exercises alongside the UAE in the past, the drill represents the first ever public military cooperation between Israel and Bahrain. The joint exercise serves as a direct response to the Iranian navy’s presence and aggression in the waters of the Middle East, a senior Israeli naval official said Thursday “This presence is something that we need to push back as much as possible from the State of Israel, from the Red Sea, from the areas that harm our freedom to sail… in order to do that, we need to make our partnerships tighter,” the senior officer told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Since February, Iran and Israel have been accused of engaging in what analysts have called a naval “shadow war,” in which vessels linked to each nation have come under attack in waters around the Gulf in tit-for-tat exchanges.

Israel has twice conducted airstrikes on enemy nations’ nuclear programs, bombing Iraq’s nuclear reactor in 1981 and Syria’s in 2007. However, an attack on Iran’s nuclear program is widely expected to be far more complicated as Tehran has spread out its facilities throughout the country, buried them deep underground, and funded a number of powerful proxies throughout the region who would likely retaliate against Israel if such a strike should be carried out. Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, Jan. 7 By Maksim Tsurkov - Trend: For Tehran, possible gas supplies from Iran to Georgia will have a political context, not an economic one, said Vagif Aliyev, head of the Investment Department of State Oil Company of Azerbaijan in an interview with ANS TV channel. He added that while Georgia is a close neighbor and strategic ally of Azerbaijan, each state determines its own energy strategy. "SOCAR has strong position in Georgia. Over the past five years, SOCAR has become the largest taxpayer in Georgia. Georgia and Azerbaijan signed an agreement on gas deliveries until 2030", Aliyev said. "We are the main supplier of natural gas to the country, in addition, another part of the volume Tbilisi receives as transit fee for transportation of Russian gas through its territory to Armenia." Azerbaijan exported 1.5 billion cubic meters of gas to Georgia in Jan.-Nov. 2015. Gas from Azerbaijan to Georgia is delivered via the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipeline, which transports gas produced in "Shah Deniz" gas-condensate field in the Caspian's Azerbaijani sector. SOCAR supplies its own gas to Georgia via a pipeline that passes through the Azerbaijan's Gazakh district. Power flow of gas through this pipeline is about three billion cubic meters a year. Azerbaijan is the main supplier of gas to Georgia with a share of 77.9 percent of total imports of this category. Speaking about possible gas supplies to Georgia from Iran, Aliyev said that it could happen, most likely, on the small scale. "It is important to think how important the Georgian market is for Iran," he said. According to the agreement with Georgia, Iran has to deliver gas to Armenian border and Georgia will receive it on its border with this country. Currently, Iran exports gas to Turkey in the framework of the gas swaps with Azerbaijan - to Nakhchivan, as well as to Armenia. ---

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, Jan. 14 By Elena Kosolapova - Trend: Georgia is considering the possibility to replace the Russian gas with the gas from Azerbaijan, said Georgian Deputy Energy Minister Mariam Valishvili in an exclusive interview with Trend Jan. 14. She said this issue is being discussed at the negotiations with Azerbaijan's State Oil Company (SOCAR) and Russia's Gazprom. Azerbaijan is the main supplier of gas to Georgia. Russian gas deliveries to Georgia are carried out only in the form of payment for its transit to Armenia, for which the country is supplied with 10 percent of total shipments. Gazprom supplied 300 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas to Georgia in 2014. Currently, Georgia is discussing with Gazprom the possibility for the Russian side to pay for gas transit to Armenia in money, said Valishvili. The amount that Russia has to pay for transit in 2016 is being discussed particularly. Valishvili said that the negotiations on the terms of gas transit to Armenia are held annually as the contract is concluded for one year. "Those 10 percent of the gas that Georgia has previously received from Russia, are planned to be replaced with supplies from Azerbaijan as far as possible," she said. "This possibility has been discussed during the negotiations with SOCAR this week," she said. "But the experts must examine the technical preparedness of the existing pipelines from Azerbaijan to Georgia for increasing the supplies in the required volumes." She also said that Georgia's gas needs are growing every year. "It will be impossible to completely replace the Russian gas, which is being received as the payment for transit, with Azerbaijani gas," she said. "Georgia can compensate the remaining volumes through the direct supplies from Russia. The possibility of such supplies was also discussed at the talks with Gazprom, but the prices offered by the Russian side are quite high." Valishvili also said that currently there is no infrastructure for gas supplies from any third country. "In the long-term, Georgia is interested in gas supplies from Iran, but this issue is not on the agenda in the near-term, and no talks with Tehran are underway on this issue," she added. The deputy minister also said that technical specifications of the already available gas infrastructure, as well as the possibility of Azerbaijan's participation in the construction of new facilities of this infrastructure in Georgia, were discussed during the talks with SOCAR. The issue of cost of the Azerbaijani gas delivered to Georgia was not discussed, she added. At the same time, Valishvili stressed that Azerbaijan sells gas to Georgia at a very competitive and favorable price. The deputy minister said that no agreements with Gazprom and SOCAR have been reached yet. --- Follow the author on Twitter: @E_Kosolapova

News article:
Athens: Greece’s biggest oil refiner Hellenic Petroleum agreed on Friday to buy crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), the first European refiner to restart trade relations with Iran after the lifting of international sanctions. Hellenic Petroleum was a major buyer of Iranian crude, which accounted for about 20 per cent of the southeast European country’s annual crude oil imports before sanctions were imposed on Tehran in 2011. The agreement came after Iran’s Deputy Oil Minister Amir Hossein Zamaninia and his Greek counterpart Panos Skourletis met in Athens on Friday. The two ministers also attended talks between executives from Hellenic Petroleum and NIOC, a meeting reported by Reuters on January 18. Under the deal, the refiner will start buying oil from Iran immediately and will settle its multimillion euro outstanding debt to NIOC, Hellenic Petroleum said in a bourse filing. Hellenic Petroleum is estimated to owe Iran around $550-600 million (Dh2.01-2.2 million) for oil it bought before the sanctions but was unable to pay when the international embargo was imposed. “The deal was achieved after consecutive meetings in Athens and Tehran,” Hellenic Petroleum said. “The deal is beneficial for both sides.” After meeting Zamininia, Skourletis told Reuters Iran believed Greece could be a conduit for re-entering Europe’s oil market. “They [Iran] are positively disposed towards Greece and think that Greece can be the European conduit for them to re-enter the market,” he said, adding that the two countries had traditionally enjoyed close relations. Cooperation “They [Iran] said that the debt [settlement] can open the way so that our cooperation is boosted,” Skourletis said, adding that Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was due to visit Iran early next month. Iran used to sell as much as 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) to European refiners in Italy, Spain and Greece before the sanctions over its nuclear programme were imposed. Tehran ordered a 500,000-bpd increase in its oil output, of which 200,000 bpd will go to Europe, after the sanctions were lifted on Saturday. But European companies and trading houses are not rushing to buy the oil because of legal uncertainties over the lifting of sanctions that are likely to take weeks to clarify.

Hellenic Petroleum is estimated to owe Iran around $550-600 million (Dh2.01-2.2 million) for oil it bought before the sanctions but was unable to pay when the international embargo was imposed. “The deal was achieved after consecutive meetings in Athens and Tehran,” Hellenic Petroleum said. “The deal is beneficial for both sides.” After meeting Zamininia, Skourletis told Reuters Iran believed Greece could be a conduit for re-entering Europe’s oil market. “They [Iran] are positively disposed towards Greece and think that Greece can be the European conduit for them to re-enter the market,” he said, adding that the two countries had traditionally enjoyed close relations. Cooperation “They [Iran] said that the debt [settlement] can open the way so that our cooperation is boosted,” Skourletis said, adding that Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was due to visit Iran early next month. Iran used to sell as much as 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) to European refiners in Italy, Spain and Greece before the sanctions over its nuclear programme were imposed. Tehran ordered a 500,000-bpd increase in its oil output, of which 200,000 bpd will go to Europe, after the sanctions were lifted on Saturday. But European companies and trading houses are not rushing to buy the oil because of legal uncertainties over the lifting of sanctions that are likely to take weeks to clarify.

Athens: Greece’s biggest oil refiner Hellenic Petroleum agreed on Friday to buy crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), the first European refiner to restart trade relations with Iran after the lifting of international sanctions. Hellenic Petroleum was a major buyer of Iranian crude, which accounted for about 20 per cent of the southeast European country’s annual crude oil imports before sanctions were imposed on Tehran in 2011. The agreement came after Iran’s Deputy Oil Minister Amir Hossein Zamaninia and his Greek counterpart Panos Skourletis met in Athens on Friday. The two ministers also attended talks between executives from Hellenic Petroleum and NIOC, a meeting reported by Reuters on January 18. Under the deal, the refiner will start buying oil from Iran immediately and will settle its multimillion euro outstanding debt to NIOC, Hellenic Petroleum said in a bourse filing.

News article:
(MENAFN- AFP) French energy giant Total will sign a contract with Iran to buy crude oil, the company's chief executive said Thursday after meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during his visit to France. "We plan to sign a contract which will allow us to take between 150,000 and 200,000 barrels of crude a day," Patrick Pouyanne said. The deal will be signed at the French presidency later Thursday. With the end of economic and financial sanctions, Iran has decided to increase its oil production to 500,000 barrels a day, a decision which further weakened oil prices last week. The price of crude oil is currently around $32 (29 euros) a barrel, about 70 percent less than it was in June 2014. Iran, which has the world's fourth-largest oil reserves, currently produces 2.8 million barrels a day, about a million of which are destined for export. Pouyanne said other French projects were also in the pipeline with Iran. "Total has been very present in Iran, very loyal to Iran. We have obviously envisaged other projects but they need to be discussed," he said.

News article:
Turkey won an arbitration case against Iran in a gas dispute and will receive a 13.3 to 15.8 percent discount on gas purchased from Iran between 2011 and 2015. The news was announced by Iranian Deputy Oil Minister Hamidreza Araqi as a discount around 10 to 15 percent, the country's semi-official Tasnim news agency reported yesterday morning. The minister reportedly said: "Although the court's [the International Court of Arbitration] ruling is final, the money that Iran should pay out to Turkey has not yet been determined," while estimating the compensation to be around $1 billion. Later in the day, speaking to a TV channel, Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak said that the mentioned discount will be something between 13.3 and 15.8 percent and Iran will be paying back the higher amount Turkey paid.The two sides have to agree on the exact percentage of the discount in a few months. If they fail to agree on a certain percentage, the court will make a decision on that too. Turkey currently imports about 10 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Iran – the country's second largest supplier after Russia – under a 25-year deal that was signed in 1996. However, stating that the price charged by Iran was too high, Turkey approached the International Court of Arbitration in 2012, demanding that the price be lowered by 25 percent.Iran agreed to the discount only if the imported amount of gas was increased, which Ankara rejected. The issue was therefore taken to court, which decided in Turkey's favor, setting the discount at a 10 to 15 percent, according to Araqi.In 2012, Turkey approached International Court of Arbitration with a second case, claiming that Iran's delivery was lower than the agreed amount and decided in favor of Iran. Turkey's state-run BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corporation sued Iran in 2014 over high gas prices. Winning the case, BOTAŞ received a 16.5 percent discount and a $900 million payment from Iran.The discount has led to expectations of a discount in domestic prices. Energy prices have been an issue for Turkey since they started to follow a global downward trend. Last week Albayrak said that prices, which have been declining since June 2014, will soon be reflected in domestic natural gas prices. Due to the fluctuations in energy prices over the last decade, natural gas prices have been increasing and Turks have faced very high costs. Albayrak said that the government tried to deflect these increasing costs through subsidies and, as a result, BOTAŞ has been suffering losses for years. "Recently, we have seen energy prices decreasing and, therefore, hopefully this decrease will also mean BOTAŞ can offer discounts on its price tariffs," he said.Yesterday Albayrak stated that the government has been working on a discount package for energy prices, and Iran's forced-discount will strengthen this government plan. "Hopefully, this discount will be reflected in consumer prices soon," he added.Meanwhile, Turkey's natural gas consumption reached a new high, with 235 million cubic meters burned on a daily basis last week, while many parts of the country suffered from extreme cold. According to a report by the Anadolu Agency (AA) from data compiled by the Ministry for Energy and Natural Resources, Turkey consumed a total of 1.128 billion cubic meters of natural gas between Jan. 25 and Jan. 29, which is equal to an average consumption 235 million cubic meters per day. These figures are a historic high for the national consumption of natural gas.When weather forecasts hitting minus 20 degrees Celsius just one week earlier, the Ministry for Energy and Natural Resources considered the possibility of high natural gas consumption in houses and, accordingly, ordered power plants producing electricity from natural gas to switch to using reserve fuel. Power plants started generating electricity from fuel oil or diesel oil on Jan. 21, and returned to normal operations in stages after temperatures returned normal seasonal averages.Total annual natural gas consumption stood at 48 billion cubic meters in Turkey in 2014. The Turkish Natural Gas Distributors Union Association (GAZBİR) downgraded their estimates for the coming year's annual consumption of natural gas from 51 billion cubic meters to 47.8 billion cubic meters.

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, Feb. 4 By Aygun Badalova - Trend: Iran may attach political importance to exporting gas to Europe, in a way to complicate the possible reapplication of sanctions against the country, David Koranyi, director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasian Energy Futures Initiative and deputy director of the Atlantic Council's Dinu Patriciu Eurasia Center believes. Koranyi told Trend that Iran's gas production potential is enormous, however yet the country faces formidable obstacles to gas exports. "Domestic residential demand continues to grow, and gas is needed for reinjection into oil fields to keep up production,"Koranyi told Trend. For Iran, many obstacles to foreign investment will remain even after the sanctions have been lifted, he believes. Koranyi mentioned that Iran also plans to build up a first class petrochemical industry and export electricity regionally instead of gas. The country's petrochemical output capacity currently stands at 60 million tons. The Islamic Republic hopes to bring this capacity to 120 million tons by 2020 and 180 million tons by 2025. "The current price environment in Europe does not help either, it does not seem commercially viable to bring gas all the way from South Pars to the European markets," Koranyi said. "At the same time Iran may attach political importance to exporting gas to Europe by pipeline or LNG, as it will increase its importance and complicate the reapplication of sanctions in a worst case scenario," he added. On January 16, the International Atomic Energy Agency verified Tehran's compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), opening the way for Iran's return to the global energy market. The same day, the US and the European Union announced that they were lifting their sanctions against Iran. Iran holds 17 percent of the world's proved natural gas reserves and more than one-third of OPEC's reserves, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). As of January 2015, Iran's estimated proved natural gas reserves were 1,201 trillion cubic feet. At the same time, Iran is the world's third-largest dry natural gas producer, after the US and Russia. In 2013, Iran became the world's largest gas-flaring country, surpassing Russia, according to the EIA. Last year Head of National Iranian Gas Exports Company Alireza Kameli said that the export of gas to Europe is uneconomical for Iran. He also said that exporting LNG to European markets is on Iranian Oil Ministry's top agenda. Speaking about the oil sector, Koranyi said that Iran's return will have profound repercussions for international markets. "Iran's barrels will add to an already oversupplied global oil markets and may drive down prices further," he said. Iran's current oil production is estimated to be around 2.8 million barrels per day (mbpd), of which about one million barrels are exported. Free of sanctions, the country plans to increase its oil export by 500,000 barrels per day, and then raise the figure by another 500,000 to two million barrels per day within a six month period at the next step.

After lifting the international sanctions on Iran, its crude oil sales to Europe reached above 300,000 barrels, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Saturday. Iran’s oil exports used to record a high of more than 3 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2011; however, the tougher sanctions imposed on Iran in 2012 because of its nuclear program, lead to a fall to a little more than 1 million bpd. After the rubber-stamping of the nuclear deal with world powers last year, however, Tehran has ordered a 500,000 bpd increase in oil output. “Based on the contract signed between the National Iranian Oil Co and France’s Total, it was agreed that Total will buy 160,000 bpd of crude oil from Iran to be delivered in Europe,” Zanganeh was quoted as saying by news agency SHANA. The contract would be finalized on Feb 16, he added. Furthermore, Zanganeh also said Italy’s Eni was interested in buying 100,000 barrels of crude oil from Iran and its representatives would visit Tehran in near future to discuss the contract. “Eni has voiced its interest in one of Iran’s fields which will be treated like the agreement reached with Total,” he said. Iran’s oil minister said Italian refiner Saras was intent to buy 60,000 to 70,000 barrels of crude oil from Iran. Tehran is working on attracting foreign investors that have been frightened by sanctions and low by mitigating the terms it offers on oil development contracts. Tehran and its pragmatic president are putting in efforts to deliver the promise of economic recovery. The new contracts, comprising those in the upstream exploration and development sectors are expected to attract more than $40 billion in foreign investment. Iran has put off a planned oil conference in London, which was due to have taken place in February to reveal its new contracts, until November. An Iranian official said “the U.S. urged Tehran to hold off” until a final nuclear deal was reached.

Despite the current global glut in crude that began to send prices plunging in mid-2014, Iran is starting to prime its pumps in an effort to boost exports by a million barrels of oil per day in six months. The first Iranian oil shipment to depart the country since the lifting of U.S. and other Western sanctions Jan. 16 will leave this weekend, according to the head of Iran’s state-owned oil company. Four million barrels of crude are headed to French, Russian and Spanish customers, National Iranian Oil Co. (NIOC) Managing Director Roknoddin Javadi said Saturday. “Two million barrels of the cargo has been purchased by France’s Total and the rest is purchased by two companies from Russia and Spain,” Javadi was quoted as saying by Iran’s official energy news service Shana. Javadi didn’t identify the other customers, but said the oil purchased by the Russian firm is destined for Romanian refineries. OPEC Crude Oil Basket Reference Price | FindTheData The deal with the French oil giant Total SA came in the wake of a high-profile European tour taken by a business delegation headed by Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani last month. Total executives agreed to buy 160,000 barrels a day of Iranian oil. This is the first shipment associated with that agreement. Iran is undercutting its geopolitical rival Saudi Arabia by about a dollar per barrel for oil sold to Europe in a bid to lure business away from the oil-rich kingdom, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has been tapping its massive budget surplus and selling oil at a discount to Asia as it grapples with the U.S. shale boom that has disrupted the global energy landscape. Concerns about losing market share have kept crude flowing out of OPEC member states, exacerbating the global supply glut that’s rattled oil-dependent economies from Oklahoma to Nigeria. Meanwhile, there’s now so much oil out there that the world is running out of places to store it. The energy shipment this weekend isn’t the first to go to a European buyer since the lifting of sanctions last month. The Swiss commodities trading giant Glencore PLC last week loaded 80,000 metric tons of Iranian fuel oil, a distillate product that can be used as heating oil, on a ship destined for the UAE. While Iran is able to sell oil more freely now than in the recent past, U.S. sanctions related to the country’s record on human rights and terrorism remain in place. Many shipowners are hesitant to carry the nation’s crude because these sanctions prohibit dollar-based transactions with Iranian companies or their government. Most oil is paid for in dollars, which means that to avoid U.S. scrutiny the transactions have to be carried out using currency conversions that raise costs. Many European insurers also are reluctant to cover cargo ships carrying Iran’s oil because they use the American financial system and pool resources with American companies, according to the Wall Street Journal. This exposes them to U.S. retaliatory measures.

Iran has shipped crude oil to Europe for the first time in five years just a month after world powers lifted sanctions on Tehran in step with the landmark nuclear deal reached last July. The oil shipment to Europe opened “a new chapter” in Iran’s oil industry, Rokneddin Javadi, Deputy Oil Minister said on Sunday, IRNA news agency reported. Iran is said to have recently loaded several European tankers with oil after announcing on Saturday that it would do so within the next 24 hours. “In the coming 24 hours, 4 million barrels of crude oil will be loaded onto 3 tankers destined for Europe,” Rokneddin Javadi, managing director of the National Iranian Oil Company, was quoted as saying by the Shana news agency. “Of those 4 million barrels of crude, 2 million barrels are assigned to France’s Total, and 2 million barrels have been bought by two companies in Russia and Spain,” he added. Iran has signed a deal with French oil giant Total for daily export of 160,000 to 180,000 barrels of oil per day, according to the IRNA. While Iran has just recently restarted oil exports to Europe, it has steadily been increasing its oil exports to Japan, challenging Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and UAE, Mehr news agency reported on Sunday. Iran’s exports to Japan have increased by 34 percent since December of 2015, while Saudi Arabia has witnessed only a 5-percent rise. Iran is seeking to gain at least 10 percent of Japan’s market, which would mean a daily export of 350,000 barrels per day, Mehr news agency said, citing Seyyed Mohsen Ghamsari, Executive Director for International Affairs at National Iranian Oil Company. Another announcement was made by Iran’s vice president on Saturday, who also said that the country’s overall exports are set to substantially increase. “One of the opportunities created by the JCPOA was the increase in oil exports,” Jahangiri said, referring to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers, the Tasnim news agency reported. #Iran’s #Oil Exports to Hit 2mln bpd in Coming Months: First VPhttps://t.co/Wed378iqWq — Tasnim News Agency (@Tasnimnews_EN) February 13, 2016 He said that Iran’s exports, which currently stand at 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd), will amount to 1.5 million bpd by mid-March, and to 2 million within a few months. The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) is also seeking to step up its oil trade with other costumers, including China, South Korea, India and Turkey. Western countries lifted sanctions on Iran in January after the UN nuclear watchdog confirmed that Tehran had complied with all of the conditions required under a deal designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.

News article:
Greece is in preliminary talks with Iran to secure natural gas for local needs and provide a gateway for the Persian Gulf nation to supply fuel to other parts of Europe, Greek Energy Minister Panos Skourletis said on Feb.24. Greece produces little oil and almost no gas, while Iran is a member of OPEC and holds gas reserves that BP Plc ranks as the world's largest. According to Bloomberg, the countries agreed in January for Iran to supply crude to Hellenic Petroleum SA and buy oil products from the refiner. That deal, possibly Iran's first such agreement with a European company since the lifting of sanctions, opens the road to cooperation in the gas market too, Skourletis said in an interview in Athens. "What's sure is that Iran wants to start selling its natural gas in liquefied form using ships and is interested in Greece," he said. The Revythousa re-gasification terminal near Athens is one potential entry point for Iranian gas, and a planned facility at Alexandroupolis in the north of the country is another. Iran is interested in both sites "for exporting to Europe," Skourletis said. Iranian Oil Ministry media officials in Tehran couldn't be reached for immediate comment. Diversifying Supply Greece is hoping that the removal last month of international sanctions against Iran will help it diversify its sources of energy and enhance the European country's role as a regional energy-distribution hub. Greece was forced to import more liquefied natural gas and switch at least one power plant to using oil for fuel in 2009, when a dispute between Russia and Ukraine disrupted gas supplies. Iran's Deputy Oil Minister Amir Hossein Zamaninia discussed potential energy cooperation with Skourletis on Jan. 22 in Athens. Iran, which currently lacks facilities to export LNG, wants to use idle capacity at a facility in neighboring Oman to process raw gas into a liquefied form for sale, the Iranian Oil Ministry's news service Shana reported on Feb. 21, citing Alireza Kameli, managing director of National Iranian Gas Export Co. Iran and Oman are negotiating to build a pipeline to send gas across the Persian Gulf to the Omani facility, Shana reported. By liquefying gas, producers can ship it by tanker to distant markets not linked by pipelines. Regional Pipelines Iranian companies have expressed interest in participating with Depa, Greece's state-run gas supplier, in a company that will build and run the planned floating LNG storage and re-gasification facility at Alexandroupolis, Skourletis said. Expansion of the Revythousa gas-importing terminal will be completed in 2017, and with adequate investment, the plant could also send gas northward to other areas in Europe, he said. Both facilities will be connected to two international pipeline systems, the planned Trans Adriatic Pipeline and Gas Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria links, Skourletis said. The market test for the Interconnector pipeline, which will link the Greek and Bulgarian gas systems, is due to be finished this month. "If that shows that the project is viable, it will open the road for the Alexandroupolis facility," Skourletis said. Iran is also interested in Greece's refineries, he said. The Greek government has no plans to reduce its 35 percent share in Hellenic Petroleum, the country's biggest refiner, so any purchase of a stake could only happen via a private investor in the company, Skourletis said. Paneuropean Oil & Industrial Holdings, owned by the Latsis Group, owns 43 percent of Hellenic Petroleum, according to the refiner's website.

News article:
Baku, Azerbaijan, March 4 Trend: After having signed an agreement with Azerbaijan's state oil company SOCAR, there is no more need in importing gas from Iran, said Kakha Kaladze, Georgian deputy prime minister and energy minister. He made the remarks at a joint press conference with SOCAR President Rovnag Abdullayev, Georgia Online news website reported March 4. Kaladze said Georgia started simultaneous talks with Iran due to technical problems regarding the natural gas supply from Azerbaijan. "We had a meeting and talked about how it was possible to receive Iran's gas," Kaladze said. "Theoretically, there is an opportunity for that, but there is no such a need today. We have signed an agreement with a strategically partner country, a company, which will ensure the natural gas supply to Georgia and meet the market's needs." Georgia and Azerbaijan's SOCAR signed agreements March 4 in Tbilisi, under which the Azerbaijani side will increase natural gas supply to Georgia by 463 million cubic meters and reduce prices for the gas sold at social tariffs, as well as the commercially sold gas.

News article:
Algeciras, Spain: The Monte Toledo oil tanker covered the uneventful voyage from Iran to Europe with a haul of 1 million barrels of crude in just 17 days, but its journey has been four years in the making. On Sunday, the tanker became the first to deliver Iranian crude into Europe since mid-2012, when Brussels imposed an oil embargo in an attempt to force the Middle Eastern nation to negotiate the end of its nuclear programme. The ban was lifted in January as part of a broader deal that ended a decade of sanctions. The 275-metre tanker started offloading its cargo into a refinery owned by Cia Espanola de Petroleos, near Algeciras, a few miles from Gibraltar. By midday, the vessel had already pumped to shore about a fifth of its cargo. In southern Spain, the tanker’s arrival was met with little fanfare. It was a quiet Sunday at the refinery, and for the workers, the Monte Toledo is just one of the eight or so vessels they expect to receive this month. By the time the refinery has taken in all the Iranian crude, another tanker from Algeria will be already waiting. Nonetheless, there’s a wider significance. As the Monte Toledo started to pump to shore through two 21-inch floating hoses connected to a giant buoy and a 1.8km submarine pipeline, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani declared in Tehran that more oil exports “will be added soon.” Ali Tayebnia, the country’s minister of Economy and Finance, said that Iran’s oil exports will “soon return” to 2 million barrels a day. “Arrangements have been made for the return of Iran to the market,” he said according to Shana, the Oil Ministry’s news service. Around Europe, other tankers with Iranian oil are close behind the Monte Toledo. In February, 29 vessels loaded crude from the Middle Eastern nation, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Of those, three are heading toward Europe — the Eurohope tanker is sailing to Constanta, an oil port in Romania, and the Atlantas is on its way to France. Another one, the Distya Akula, is anchored at the mouth of the Suez Canal, and is likely to head into a Mediterranean port. The Monte Toledo and its companions are the vanguard in the return of Iran into the European oil market. Petro-Logistics SA, a Geneva-based tanker-tracking firm, estimated Iran exported in February about 1.4 million barrels a day, up 350,000 barrels a day from the average 2015 level. Although the increase falls short of the 500,000 barrels a day that Tehran had promised, there are signs that exports into Europe will pick up this month. “It does take a while to get those fields back up,” said Petro-Logistics director Daniel Gerber. “But I think they’re going to hit the increase of 500,000 barrels a day in March.” Seth Kleinman, head of energy research at Citigroup Inc in London, agreed, saying that in addition to higher export volumes this month, more countries were buying. “You see tankers going to Spain, Romania, Tanzania, France and the UAE,” he said. “You got an uptick to India in February too.” Still, hurdles remain. Lingering banking restraints mean some customers are finding it hard to transfer payments for Iranian crude and the National Iranian Oil Co. has offered to swap crude for gasoline to get deals done, according to local reports. Iran will want to win back customers in Europe, where Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other rival suppliers stepped in after the embargo was imposed. Tehran also faces a rival unknown four years ago: the US has started exporting crude and companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp are shipping American oil into refineries in the Mediterranean. Before the embargo Europe imported on average about 400,000 barrels a day of oil from Iran, according to the International Energy Agency. Cepsa alone was buying about 60,000 barrels a day. Total SA was among the biggest buyers and the French company is waiting to receive the Atlantas tanker later this month at its refinery in Le Havre. Other European top buyers in the past, including Repsol SA, Eni SpA and Hellenic Petroleum SA, have yet to purchase any. If all goes as Tehran has planned, the Middle Eastern country will boost its production back to the 3.6 million barrels a day it pumped in 2011. After the European embargo was imposed and the US tightened other sanctions, Iranian output dropped to about 2.8 million barrels a day. In February, the nation pumped 3 million barrels a day for the first time since July 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

President János Áder expressed Hungary’s keenness to support Egypt’s developmental efforts in a meeting with President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi in Budapest on Tuesday. El-Sisi has been on an official visit to the Hungarian capital since Monday, when he attended a summit for the Visegrád Group in which he tackled Egypt’s efforts to fight terrorism and block illegal immigration to Europe. Áder expressed during his meeting with El-Sisi following the summit his country’s keenness to extend its support to Egypt in all fields by exchanging expertise and fostering joint investments, a statement by the Egyptian presidency read. El-Sisi, from his side, said that Hungarian investments and industries currently have an opportunity to enter the Egyptian market and enjoy the country’s modern infrastructure and its access to African markets. The two leaders also discussed a number of regional and international issues of mutual concern, especially the developments in Libya, Afghanistan, as well as joint efforts to face the repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic. Áder hailed Egypt’s role in consolidating stability in the Middle East and Africa as well as its efforts to combat illegal immigration, ensure co-existence among religions, and back peaceful solutions to the region’s crises. The Hungarian president stressed that his country fully understands the Egyptian stance towards the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and the importance of the River Nile’s water to Egypt, affirming that settling the GERD dispute should enhance stability in the entire region. Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia recently expressed their readiness to engage in the African Union-sponsored negotiations to resolve their decade-long dispute over the mega dam Addis Ababa is building on the Blue Nile. In this regard, El-Sisi reiterated on Tuesday Egypt’s stance on the need to reach a legally binding agreement that regulates the filling and operation of the dam based on international law and the UN Security Council’s presidential statement, which was issued in mid-September, encouraging the three sides to return to the negotiation table of the AU. The two leaders also hailed the ongoing level of cooperation and coordination between Egypt and Hungary in the management of water resources, especially water treatment plants. Since 1926, Hungary’s manufacturer Ganz EEPM has delivered more than 200 complete pumping stations to Egypt, according to the company’s website. Áder also lauded Egypt’s recent steps regarding the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which led to consolidating calm between the Israeli and Palestinian sides and improving the Palestinians’ humanitarian conditions. Egypt, through diplomatic efforts, has urged the revival of the peace process between the Israeli and Palestinian sides to ensure Palestinians’ legitimate rights, ease regional tensions, and achieve stability in the Middle East. Such efforts included a meeting between El-Sisi and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett last month in Egypt, marking the first time an Israeli PM has made a visit to Egypt in a decade. Additionally, in May, Egypt sponsored a ceasefire deal between Israel and Palestinian factions within the Gaza Strip to end an 11-day episode of Israeli military aggression on Gaza, during which more than 250 Palestinians, including 66 children, were killed. Egypt also pledged $500 million for the reconstruction of Gaza in the aftermath of the Israeli attacks. Search Keywords: Short link:

The European Union hopes to approve the new partnership document with Cairo during the upcoming Egypt-EU Association Council's ministerial meetings, Head of the European Union Delegation to Egypt Christian Berger said Saturday. The council will convene once discussions with Egypt are completed, Berger told reporters. The talks focus on exchanging ideas and determining priorities that have changed since 2016, he added. The new priorities include responses to the coronavirus pandemic, health and vaccines production files, as well as social and green files, the EU diplomat told MENA. The European Union and the Egyptian Ministry of Energy and Renewable Energy are working to update an energy strategy to focus on renewable, wind, solar and hydrogen energies, he added. New priority areas also include the economy's digitisation and various artificial intelligence domains, Berger said. Regarding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, Berger called for resuming talks among Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia. EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa Annette Weber will visit Cairo within weeks to hold talks with Egyptian officials in this regard, he said. "We believe that the parties can and must reach an agreement. We will do everything possible to reach such a deal." Berger also praised projects launched in Egypt's New Administrative Capital and other new cities. "Those great efforts will be a strong catalyst for the Egyptian economy in the construction sector." On investment in Egypt, the EU Commissioner for Neighborhood Policy and Enlargement Oliver Varheli will visit Egypt by the end of October to discuss many issues before the launch of the EU's new investment plan for the southern neighbourhood in February 2022. Egypt enjoys several advantages in the investment field, especially when it comes to infrastructure, transportation, ease of exporting products and new legislation, he added. Renewable energy is a promising sector for investment where Egypt already possesses huge potentials, he further added. Berger also welcomed Egypt's new human rights strategy. "We are ready to share our experience with Egypt in translating its various axes into legislation." Search Keywords: Short link:

Egyptian Foreign Minister and the UK Minister for the Middle East and North Africa James Cleverly welcomed on Sunday recent progress in bilateral relations since the Egypt-UK free trade agreement went into force earlier this year, as well as the easing of the travel restrictions between the two countries. Shoukry also discussed various means of boosting Egyptian-British ties with Cleverly, who is on his first official visit to Egypt. The British minister's visit comes nearly a month after the UK removed Egypt from a travel red list, which imposes a mandatory 10-day quarantine at a hotel on visitors from Egypt to the kingdom due to coronavirus concerns. The free trade agreement, known as the association deal, was signed between Egypt and the UK in December 2020 to provide a platform to deepen trade and investment relations between the two countries after Brexit. The two ministers said the new developments would contribute to promoting tourism and investment between Cairo and London, a statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry said. Shoukry expressed during the meeting Egypt's support for the efforts made by the UK to make the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) successful. The event is scheduled to be hosted in Glasgow in November. Egypt is hoping the conference's outcomes will push forward efforts to combat climate change, most significantly providing support to developing countries under the 2016 Paris agreement, Shoukry added. Shoukry noted that Egypt is looking forward to hosting the next session of the COP in 2022, adding that the country seeks to help boost international efforts to face climate change. Egypt has been selected as a nominee to host the UN Climate Change Conference COP 27, scheduled for November 2022.

News article:
President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi flew to the Greek Capital Athens on Tuesday to attend the ninth trilateral summit between Egypt, Greece, and Cyprus. During the summit, the three countries signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) covering energy cooperation. Last week, during the minister of electricity and renewable energy’s visit to Athens a MoU was signed to build an undersea cable connecting the Egyptian and Greek power grids. An almost identical MoU was signed between Egypt and Cyprus on Saturday, which will see the two countries exchange up to two gigawatts of electricity. The memoranda are all part of the Euro-Africa $4 billion interconnector project, an electricity highway connecting the national grids of Egypt, Cyprus and Greece via a 1396km submarine cable. The summit also saw the initialling of an agreement between the three states covering immigration. This week’s summit will build on the achievements of earlier summits, says Presidential Spokesman Bassam Rady. The ninth trilateral summit is part of a cooperation mechanism launched in 2014 between Egypt, Greece, and Cyprus. The summits quickly turned into a broad alliance fostering cooperation across a range of economic, political, and strategic interests. During the sixth summit in Crete in 2018 the three countries decided to establish the East Mediterranean Gas Forum (EMGF). Headquartered in Cairo, EMGF also includes France, Italy, Jordan, Palestine, and Israel as members. During this week’s summit, President Al-Sisi held bilateral meetings with the Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades to discuss economic and trade relations, and regional files of mutual concern. The 10th tripartite summit is scheduled for December. *A version of this article appears in print in the 21 October, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Short link:

News article:
Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry held a meeting in Tripoli on Thursday morning with interim Prime Minister Abdel-Hamid Dbeibah ahead of attending an international conference to support Libyan stability later today. According to a statement by the foreign ministry, Shoukry affirmed to Dbeibah, who is the head of Libya's Government of National Unity (GNU), Egypt’s support of all efforts aiming at fully implementing the roadmap agreed upon by Libyans and ensuring the exit of all military and armed foreign troops from the country. "This should come in a way that meets the aspirations of the Libyan people toward a better future and contributes to restoring Libyan security, stability, and territorial integrity and sovereignty," Shoukry said. Delegates from 31 countries and international organisations are participating in the conference, including the UN, the European Union, the Arab League, and the African Union. This includes Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, Malta, Chad, Niger, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Turkey, the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, Russia, China, and DR Congo. The Tripoli conference comes two months ahead of planned parliamentary and presidential elections, which are scheduled for 24 December as part of the political roadmap agreed to by all Libyan parties in a United Nations-led peace process. Egypt has affirmed on several occasions the necessity of holding the Libyan elections on schedule, as a step toward ending the decade-long of conflict in the country. On Monday, President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi stressed to German Chancellor Angela Merkel the necessity of moving forward with the political process in Libya, holding elections in the country in December, and the exit of all foreign forces from the country. In September, Libya's eastern-based parliament passed a no-confidence vote in the Libyan unity government, posing a new challenge for holding the planned elections. The vote, however, failed to secure the minimum legal threshold to oust the government. The Egyptian foreign minister stressed at the time that the roadmap agreed upon by the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum and supported by the UN Security Council remains as the approach adopted by the international community to end the conflict in Libya. Shoukry also met today with Libyan Foreign Minister Najla Mangoush as well as his counterparts from Tunisia, Algeria, Greece, and Chad on the sidelines of the conference. Bilateral relations Shoukry and Dbeibah also followed up during the meeting on developments of Egyptian-Libyan relations in light of the latest round of meetings of the Egyptian-Libyan joint higher committee in September. Dbeibah hailed Egypt’s role and supportive efforts to achieve stability in Libya, advance political settlement, and bring the views of Libyan parties closer. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Egypt and Qatar aspire to promote economic cooperation amid recent rapprochement efforts between the two countries, according to Trade and Industry Minister Nevine Gamea and Qatar's Ambassador to Cairo Salem bin Mubarak Al-Shafi. Gamea and Al-Shafi met in Cairo on Friday in a new step toward developing their bilateral cooperation, which resumed after a-four-year-hiatus following the the signing of the Al-Ula reconciliation agreement earlier this year. Friday's meeting came on the heels of a series of recent high-level talks between officials from both countries, including a meeting in August between Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, who agreed to continue consultation to boost bilateral relations. Gamea said during the meeting both countries' governments are exerting "intensive efforts" to achieve "further rapprochement" at the political and economic levels, a statement by the trade ministry read. The statement added that Gamea urged the translation of agreements between the two countries' political leadership into concrete projects that serve the interest of the two peoples. She also called for building on the "solid" ground laid by President El-Sisi and Qatari Emir Tamim to enhance the rates of trade exchange and develop joint investments. Gamea underscored the significance of establishing new frameworks for cooperation between Cairo and Doha in the commercial, investment and industrial fields as well as working on forming an Egyptian-Qatari trade committee to follow up on all projects of bilateral cooperation during the coming phase. She also stressed the importance of joint work between the two countries at the ministerial level to push bilateral relations to "unprecedented levels," the statement added. Gamea extended through the Qatari ambassador an invitation to the Qatar's Trade and Industry Minister Mohammad bin Hamad to visit Cairo "to discuss files and themes of joint work between the two countries during the next stage." For his part, the Qatari ambassador stressed that both countries share a common desire to start a new phase of bilateral cooperation in various fields, saying "Egypt represents a strategic depth for the countries of the region." Al-Shafi also called for boosting the rates of intra-regional trade and joint investments between Egypt and Qatar "to reflect the great potentials of both countries and to translate the distinguished relations that bind the two brotherly peoples," the statement added. "There is a consensus between the Egyptian and Qatari governments on a substantial number of cooperation files," the Qatari ambassador stressed. He also hailed the recent economic reforms and urban development in Egypt. He highlighted that Qatar has investments in the Egyptian market, especially in the financial and real estate sectors. The Arab quartet of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut all diplomatic ties and transport links with Qatar in June 2017, charging that Doha was too close to Iran and backed terrorist groups – allegations Doha has always denied. In January, Egypt and the Arab quartet signed the Al-Ula Declaration with Qatar, restoring diplomatic, economic and travel ties with Doha. In the wake of the Al-Ula declaration, Egypt and Qatar agreed to move beyond their disputes and work towards settling all outstanding issues. Three rounds of talks between the Egyptian-Qatari committee – tasked with developing relations between Cairo and Doha – were held throughout the year. Following the signing of the declaration, Qatar Airways and EgyptAir resumed flights between the two countries' capitals. Both countries exchanged ambassadors in the summer.

Egypt’s Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation, Mohamed Abdel Aty, meets with Oliver Varhelyi, the EU Commissioner for Neighborhood and Enlargement. (Asharq Al-Awsat) Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat Ambassador Christian Berger, head of the European Union delegation to Egypt, expressed the EU’s interest in strengthening cooperation with Cairo in the water sector. Berger stressed that the EU attaches great importance to water and the utilization of natural resources and has responded to the challenges associated with this sector in Egypt since 2007 through various programs, which contributed to creating job opportunities and improving the quality of life for the Egyptian population. His remarks came during a conference held on Tuesday on the sidelines of the Cairo Water Week (CWW), under the title, “Financing Water Projects… Challenges and Opportunities.” The conference was organized by the European Investment Bank (EIB) in partnership with the Delegation of the European Union to Egypt, the French Development Agency (AFD), and the German Development Bank (KfW). EIB Director of Lending Operations in EU Neighboring Countries, Flavia Palanza said the comprehensive Egypt Vision 2030 and the National Strategy for Water Supply and Sanitation (2008-2037) are excellent frameworks for policy dialogue and to guide investments in priority areas and projects in the water sector. Palanza pointed to many challenges associated to climate change, stressing that the financial means were not sufficient to meet them, especially due to the coronavirus pandemic. She stressed the importance of cooperation in the water sector, especially with Egypt, saying that the EU was committed to providing and adopting a comprehensive approach, grants and loans in order to enhance the benefits. Also on Tuesday, Egypt’s Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Mohamed Abdel Aty met with Oliver Varhelyi, the EU Commissioner for Neighborhood and Enlargement. “The European Union prioritizes the water issue, which is a major determinant of sustainable development, with its associated economic and social dimensions,” Varhelyi said. The EU official expressed his understanding of the importance of the Nile River for Egypt as the main source of water in the country. The meeting touched on a number of issues of common interest in which Egypt and the EU can strengthen their partnership, including climate change and migration.

El-Gebaly and Iohannis also opened an exhibition that includes several historical documents that chronicle the relations between Egypt and Romania.

News article:
The United Kingdom’s Minister for the Middle East and North Africa James Cleverly said that what Egypt has achieved in the energy field is revolutionary and has put Cairo on the path to achieving energy security. This also means that Egypt has many successful stories to tell during its participation in the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 26, Cleverly — who made his first visit to Cairo in mid-October — told Al-Ahram Daily newspaper in an interview published on Sunday. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi arrived on Sunday afternoon in Scotland to participate in the COP 26 summit slated for Monday and Tuesday in Glasgow under the chairmanship of the UK. Cleverly expressed his country’s pleasure that El-Sisi will attend the summit, saying that “Prime Minister Johnson will be very happy, as he takes the climate issue very seriously.” “We also have positive indications towards Egypt’s positions on the climate issue and environment in general,” he noted, adding that his country is already cooperating with Egypt in multiple energy and renewable energy projects. “I am confident that the climate issue is one of the most prominent fields in which we will closely cooperate for a better future for both Egypt and the UK,” he added. Egypt has advanced from 26th place in 2020 to the 20th among the world’s top 40 markets in the Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index for 2021. Under its 2030 vision, Egypt plans to increase the supply of electricity generated from renewable sources to 20 percent by 2022 and up to 42 percent by 2035, with wind providing 14 percent, hydropower 2 percent, photovoltaic 22 percent, and concentrated solar power 3 percent by 2035. Additionally, Cairo is working on a host of projects to preserve the environment by making use of the country’s plentiful natural gas production. The boom in the North African country’s gas production has been supported by huge gas discoveries and production in the Mediterranean. Including the Go Green initiative, Egypt has been exerting constant efforts to create and develop an environment-friendly industry by localising modern industrial technologies and creating professional technical cadres to fight pollution and reduce harmful emissions. Cleverly said that the UK is also interested in investing in renewables, referring to the newly signed deal between the UK’s Globeleq and the Egyptian government’s Benban Solar Energy Park. On 14 October, the British independent power producer Globeleq announced the acquisition of the ARC for Renewable Energy Plant at the Benban Solar Park near Aswan, Egypt. Cleverly confirmed that the UK is interested in investing in the energy field in Egypt after the Benban deal, adding that “Egypt is doing well in the field of energy, and it has a huge and promising future.” “We have a business sector and companies that are very enthusiastic to work in energy.” During his visit to Cairo, Cleverly held talks with a number of Egyptian ministers and officials, including Egyptian Transportation Minister Kamel El-Wazir. The British minister said that he discussed with El-Wazir investments opportunities in the transport sector’s infrastructure in Egypt. Transportation projects are so important for Egypt due to its jammed streets, Cleverly said. “I wandered across Cairo’s streets; It was so crowded. It is a huge challenge, and we have the same issue in London,” he added. “I also saw the development in the roads here [in Cairo], and I also saw several modes of transportation,” he said, stressing that the UK is very keen to continue to cooperate with Egypt in developing the transportation sector. Cleverly also discussed the decade-old dispute caused by the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), a controversial hydropower project that Addis Ababa is building on the Blue Nile, stressing that the UK understands the importance of the Nile to Egypt. “It is an existential matter,” he said. Moreover, he expressed his wish that Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia reach a deal through the negotiations. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Qatar’s ambassador in Cairo said that his country considers Egypt a fertile ground for investment in light of the unprecedented progress and the positive improvements the country is going through in all fields; particularly in the investment climate. Ambassador Salem bin Mubarak Al-Shafi made the comments during his meeting with Egypt’s Minister of Finance Mohamed Maait at the ministry's headquarters on Saturday. Qatari investments in Egypt significantly increased in FY2019/2020 by 77.8 percent to record $679.4 million, up from $382.2 million in FY2018/2019, according to the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS). Trade exchange between the two countries also went up by 11.8 percent in 2020, compared to 2019, to post $22.7 million. Al-Shafi assumed his position as Qatar's new ambassador to Egypt in August after Cairo ended a four-year diplomatic and travel boycott of Doha under the Al-Ula reconciliation agreement, which was signed in January of this year. Officials from both countries have been holding consultation meetings since to explore ways of bolstering bilateral relations. Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and Qatar’s Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani agreed in a meeting in Baghdad in August to continue consultation to boost bilateral relations during the coming period. The Qatari diplomat asserted his country's willingness to rejuvenate cooperation ties between Egypt and Qatar in all spheres in order to achieve mutual development for both countries, stressing the existence of the political will to that end. For his part, Maait stressed Egypt’s government has managed to create a healthy environment for foreign and local investments in different areas and provided promising investment opportunities in national and developmental mega projects. Egypt’s government plans to raise the private sector’s contribution to the country’s economic activity to 50 percent over the coming three years, Maait said. He also noted that the government fosters the private sector to expand its venture and productive activities as a key engine of Egypt’s economic growth. Under its Vision 2030, Egypt seeks to boost the private sector’s contribution to the GDP and attract further foreign investments. According to the latest figures, private sectors investments represented 52.5 percent of Egypt’s total investments in FY2018/2019. Maait told Al-Shafi that the government acts to enlarge the initial public offering (IPO) programme through listing more state-owned companies over the coming months for the sake of expanding their broad-based ownership and leaving an ample room for the private sector to invest in. Maait stated that the government’s economic reforms have improved the country's economic indicators and achieved the developmental and fiscal objectives during FY2020/2021. Accordingly, Egypt posted an initial surplus of 1.4 percent of the GDP, decreased the budget’s overall deficit to 7.4 percent, and achieved a 3.3 percent in real GDP growth, Maait expounded. On that basis, global finance and credit rating institutions reassured their confidence in Egypt’s economy’s solidness and its ability to counter both internal and external shocks, the minister added. Maait also reviewed with the Qatari ambassador his ministry's efforts to upgrade Egypt’s customs and tax systems in order to streamline the procedures in both systems for the investors, lay the foundation of tax justice in the business community, and engage the informal business in the formal economy. Maait pointed out that the application of the advanced cargo information (ACI) system in Egypt’s seaports would significantly reduce customs clearance measures, facilitate trade flow, and lure investment.

Egypt has inked seven development financing grant agreements with the US worth $125 million through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Minister of International Cooperation Rania Al-Mashat announced on Monday. Al-Mashat, US Ambassador to Egypt Jonathan Cohen, and Mission Director of USAID Egypt Leslie Reed witnessed the signing. The signed agreements are expected to play a role in stimulating Egypt’s government efforts in developing the sectors of basic education, higher education, science and technology, agriculture, health, economic governance, trade, and investment, in addition to $5 million allocated for combating the repercussions of the pandemic, according to the minister. The agreements allocate $17 million to the sector of basic education; $31 million to the US-Egypt Higher Education Initiative (HEI); $4 million to US-Egyptian cooperation in the sector of science and technology; $27 million to economic governance; $5 million to agriculture and rural development; and $28 million to bolstering trade and investment in Egypt. Al-Mashat elaborated that the strategic partnership with the US integrates with the national efforts of developing various sectors to achieve social and economic development referring to the ‘Closing the Gender Gap Accelerator’ that was launched by the Ministry of International Cooperation, the National Council for Women, and the World Economic Forum, which is the first unique public-private collaboration model in Africa and the Middle East that works towards taking decisive action on closing economic gender gaps. The ministry is currently designing a new programme with USAID to ensure the economic and social empowerment of women in collaboration with relevant stakeholders in order to improve the work environment for women in the private sector, as well as expand women’s financial inclusion, according to Al-Mashat. “I am pleased to announce today $125 million in economic assistance from the United States to Egypt. This is part of the US Government’s $30 billion investment in Egypt over the last 40 years, which has brought clean water and wastewater services to 25 million Egyptians, eliminated polio, built 2,000 schools, and provided 4,000 university scholarships,” said Cohen. Meanwhile, USAID’s Reed stated that the seven agreements being celebrated reinforce the strategic partnership between the United States and Egypt and the tremendous impact that the joint efforts have on Egypt’s people, adding that she is looking forward to the successes that will be achieved through these agreements. Egypt’s cooperation portfolio with the USAID since 2014 has reached about $900 million in implementing priority projects in education, higher education, governance, small- and medium-sized enterprises, tourism, agriculture, and the private sector. The total development cooperation portfolio between Egypt and the USA since 1978 amounts to over $30 billion, covering various sectors that represent development priorities for Egypt’s government.

News article:
Libyan renegade General Khalifa Haftar has sent his son to Israel to ask for political and military support, veteran Israeli journalist Yossi Melman revealed yesterday. Last Monday, a private jet took off from Dubai landed at Ben Gurion airport, Melman wrote in Haaretz. He added: "The plane was on the ground for about 90 minutes, and then continued on to its final destination in Libya," noting that it belonged "to the Libyan warlord Gen. Khalifa Haftar and is used to fly his family and aides." According to Melman, Saddan Haftar, the son of Khalifa Haftar, was on board and he met with Israeli security officials. However, Melman said it was not clear who Saddam had met with. Melman said that during his secret meeting, Saddam asked for military and political support as he is running in the presidential elections, noting that Libya would normalise ties with Israel should he win the presidency. The Israeli journalist said Khalifa Haftar has held several secret meetings with representatives from Israel's Mossad agency and from the Israeli National Security Council. Melman added that Israel has always been interested in Libya due to its geostrategic location on the Mediterranean, as it's Egypt's neighbour, and because it's home to a large Jewish community.

News article:
Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and Jordan’s Crown Prince Al-Hussein bin Abdullah II voiced their full support for Iraq’s efforts against terrorism during their meeting in Cairo on Tuesday. El-Sisi and Prince Al-Hussein reiterated their condemnation of the recent assassination attempt against Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi and affirmed their support for the country’s political path, Presidential Spokesman Bassam Rady said in a statement. World leaders and the UN Security Council have condemned the attack, which comes only a month after Iraq’s parliamentary elections. The meeting was attended by Egypt’s Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly and his Jordanian counterpart Bisher Al-Khasawneh. Minister of Tourism Khaled El-Enany, Minister of Supply Ali Moselhi, Minister of Trade and Industry Nevine Gamea, and their Jordanian counterparts were also among the attendees. El-Sisi and Al-Hussein discussed means of bolstering cooperation with Iraq within the framework of the trilateral cooperation mechanism between Egypt, Jordan and Iraq. They affirmed that the trilatera mechanism secures the appropriate chance to discuss issues and challenges of mutual concern between the three countries. Since March 2019, Egypt, Jordan and Iraq have held four trilateral summits - the latest in June in Baghdad - to promote cooperation mechanisms and reinforce political consultation on regional issues. Furthermore, El-Sisi and Al-Hussein called for concerted Arab efforts to resolve the ongoing crises in Libya and Syria. This should take place within the framework of respecting the two countries’ sovereignty and unity and eliminating the humanitarian suffering witnessed by their brotherly peoples, they affirmed. The president and the Jordanian crown prince also agreed on the need to revive the Palestinian-Israeli peace process to reach a fair and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian issue. This solution should ensure the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people in accordance with the two-state solution, including the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the borders of 1967 with East Jerusalem as its capital. Additionally, they discussed means of boosting bilateral cooperation, especially in tourism, economy, trade exchange, and small and medium enterprises. Moreover, they discussed fostering cooperation in the face of terrorism and extremist thought. They also reviewed their countries’ experiences concerning empowering women and youths and discussed the exchange of expertise in this regard. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
The United Nations in Egypt and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs co-organised a ceremony on 8 November at Tahrir Palace in Cairo to commemorate the 76th anniversary of the United Nations. The event reflected on the long-standing relationship between the UN and Egypt, ways of reinforcing multilateralism and tackling global challenges, and highlighted the different areas of cooperation between the UN in Egypt and Egypt’s government, along with the work done by the UN system in Egypt to support the government’s efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals. Attended by senior representatives from the Egyptian foreign ministry, the heads of the UN agencies in Egypt, and representatives of diplomatic missions and regional diplomatic corps in Egypt; the event was an opportunity to reflect on the long-standing and successful relationship between the UN and Egypt — a founding member of the international organisation — as well as ways of reinforcing multilateralism and tackling global challenges. Addressing the ceremony, Ihab Badawy, the assistant foreign minister for multilateral and international security, said that commemorating the UN’s 76th anniversary is “an opportunity to reaffirm our belief in the importance of collective multilateral action to address issues of joint interest.” He also highlighted the importance of adopting a comprehensive approach when dealing with the sustainable development agenda and achieving its 17 goals by 2030. “We, as partners, must acknowledge the nexus between any economic decision and its direct social impact when formulating policies aiming to achieve the SDGs on all levels. whether bilateral or multilateral.” For her part, UN Resident Coordinator in Egypt Elena Panova said that “the bonds of cooperation between Egypt and the UN are solid. It is grounded with the values and principles of the UN Charter.” “Our common goal to accelerate the implementation of the SDGs, leaving no one behind, remains the main driver of our cooperation.” “We are proud of the countless stories of joint successes derived from our partnership development framework to advance Egypt’s efforts on the people, prosperity, planet, and women portfolios,” she added. During the event, a video statement by UN Secretary-General António Guterres was screened, in which he reaffirmed the need to come together to overcome the challenges that arise from the COVID-19 pandemic, conflicts, hunger and poverty, the climate emergency, and advancing the SDGs. Guterres also said that the values that have powered the UN charter for the last 76 years — peace, development, human rights, and opportunity for all — have no expiry date. Since 1945, Egypt has been a strong partner in multilateral action. Egypt is one of the largest contributors to peacekeeping forces and has been an elected member of the Security Council five times. Egypt chaired multiple UN commissions, including the UN Peacekeeping Commission, and the Group of 77 at the United Nations in New York in 2018 and in Rome in 2019. Egypt also hosts about 38 United Nations offices and can be considered one of the largest regional centres of the organisation. Search Keywords: Short link:

The United Nations in Egypt and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs co-organised a ceremony on 8 November at Tahrir Palace in Cairo to commemorate the 76th anniversary of the United Nations. The event reflected on the long-standing relationship between the UN and Egypt, ways of reinforcing multilateralism and tackling global challenges, and highlighted the different areas of cooperation between the UN in Egypt and Egypt’s government, along with the work done by the UN system in Egypt to support the government’s efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals. Attended by senior representatives from the Egyptian foreign ministry, the heads of the UN agencies in Egypt, and representatives of diplomatic missions and regional diplomatic corps in Egypt; the event was an opportunity to reflect on the long-standing and successful relationship between the UN and Egypt — a founding member of the international organisation — as well as ways of reinforcing multilateralism and tackling global challenges. Addressing the ceremony, Ihab Badawy, the assistant foreign minister for multilateral and international security, said that commemorating the UN’s 76th anniversary is “an opportunity to reaffirm our belief in the importance of collective multilateral action to address issues of joint interest.” He also highlighted the importance of adopting a comprehensive approach when dealing with the sustainable development agenda and achieving its 17 goals by 2030. “We, as partners, must acknowledge the nexus between any economic decision and its direct social impact when formulating policies aiming to achieve the SDGs on all levels. whether bilateral or multilateral.” For her part, UN Resident Coordinator in Egypt Elena Panova said that “the bonds of cooperation between Egypt and the UN are solid. It is grounded with the values and principles of the UN Charter.” “Our common goal to accelerate the implementation of the SDGs, leaving no one behind, remains the main driver of our cooperation.” “We are proud of the countless stories of joint successes derived from our partnership development framework to advance Egypt’s efforts on the people, prosperity, planet, and women portfolios,” she added.

News article:
World powers on Friday told Libya to stick to a plan for holding presidential elections on December 24, adding that foreign mercenaries should also leave and allow the country to turn a page in its history. French President Emmanuel Macron hosted leaders and diplomats in Paris for an international conference, declaring that Libya was now as a "crossroads" that would determine its future. The North African country has been mired in civil war since the overthrow of dictator Moamer Kadhafi in a 2011 uprising, with the bloodshed drawing in competing Libyan factions and Islamist groups, as well as regional powers. The presidential vote on December 24 is the core part of a United Nations plan to help restore stability, but the calendar has been under pressure as tensions flare once more between rival camps. "We urge all Libyan stakeholders and candidates to respect their commitments towards holding elections on 24 December 2021 (and) to accept the results of free, fair and inclusive elections," the powers said in a statement after the talks. The scheduling has remained unclear, after Libya's parliament in early October pushed back legislative elections until January. "Libya is once again at a crossroads. There have been 10 years of disorder and upheaval in which the international community is not without responsibility," said Macron. "The next six weeks will be decisive," he added. 'Concrete guarantees' The world powers also warned that sanctions could be imposed against anyone deemed to be impeding the process. "We affirm that individuals or entities, inside or outside of Libya, who might attempt to obstruct, undermine, manipulate or falsify the electoral process and the political transition will be held accountable and may be designated" by UN sanctions, their statement said. Key players attending the meeting included US Vice President Kamala Harris and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, and Russian Foreign Minister Segey Lavrov were also present. But President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Russian President Vladimir Putin were conspicuous by their absence. Libya was represented by transitional presidential council head Mohamed Al-Menfi as well as Prime Minister Abdel-Hamid Dbeibah who said: "Concrete guarantees must be obtained that the election results will be accepted and that those who reject them will be sanctioned." Earlier this week, Libya opened registration for election candidates. 'First withdrawal' The conference to endorse a plan for the departure of all foreign forces and mercenaries from Libya, with the statement giving "full support for the comprehensive Action Plan for the withdrawal of mercenaries, foreign fighters and foreign forces from the Libyan territory". Turkey had sent in troops as well as pro-Ankara militia units from Syria to shore up the Tripoli government. Observers also accuse Moscow of deploying mercenaries belonging to the Wagner group, which is allegedly controlled by a close ally of Putin. Military forces associated with Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar said in a statement ahead of the conference that 300 foreign mercenaries fighting on their side would leave the country, "at the request of France". The nationality of the fighters was not specified and no timeline was given. The UN estimates that 20,000 mercenaries and foreign fighters are deployed in Libya. "The mercenary withdrawal plan must be implemented. Russia and Turkey must withdraw their mercenaries without delay," Macron said, welcoming the announcement that 300 mercenaries would leave as a "first step". "This is only the beginning, but it is an essential beginning which finally gives credibility to a process that we have been talking about for too long," said Macron. Merkel commented that the Turkey had "reservations" about the process of withdrawing mercenaries. But she added: "It's a good thing that we can see a first withdrawal, it will serve as an example. Things have started." *This story was edited by Ahram Online Search Keywords: Short link:

French Minister of Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire stressed to Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi France's keenness on encouraging investments in Egypt, boosting strategic cooperation, with the aim of providing Cairo with all advanced technologies in all fields. Le Maire, who met El-Sisi on Friday ahead of of the Paris Conference on Libya later today, said his country is encouraging French companies to invest in Egypt within the framework of pushing up the development process in Egypt. The minister lauded recent measures adopted by Egypt to create an attractive climate for foreign investments, including facilitating government procedures and licenses related to investment, and encouraging the private sector to participate in many projects, Egyptian Presidential Spokesman Bassam Rady said. France has sizable investments in Egypt, with about 160 French companies operating in the Egyptian market in various fields. According to the French Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, the volume of French investments in Egypt exceeds 5 billion Euros, while the volume of trade exchange between the two countries reaches 3 billion Euros annually. The Egyptian president expressed his appreciation for efforts by the French Ministry of Economy and Finance in the field of boosting joint economic cooperation especially in light of the current investment opportunities in Egypt. He also expressed hope that joint cooperation would extend to new sectors, including the mega national projects in Egypt such the Decent Life initiative, a series of countryside-focused national infrastructure projects, as well as national transport projects and other projects in the education, health and energy fields, added the spokesman. El-Sisi called on French companies to participate in the investment projects offered in in the Suez Canal region and to benefit from the special merits offered by the state in that region.

News article:
France is hosting an international conference on Libya on Friday as the North African country heads into long-awaited elections next month, a vote that regional and world powers hope will pull the oil-rich nation out of its decade-old chaos. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and several world leaders will take part in the Paris conference, and are expected to push for transparent, credible elections. They will also urge the withdrawal of mercenaries and foreign forces from Libya, as stated in last year's U.N.-brokered cease-fire that ended fighting between rival factions in the country. Libya has been engulfed in chaos since a NATO-backed uprising 2011 that toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was later killed. The oil-rich country was for years split between rival governments - one based in the capital, Tripoli, and the other in the eastern part of the country. Each side is backed by different foreign powers and militias. Friday's conference is co-chaired by France, Germany, Italy, Libya, and the United Nations, and attended by international and regional high-level officials. The participants are expected to push for an "indisputable and irreversible" election process, a joint commitment to fight trafficking of people and weapons through Libya. They also are expected to advocate for tangible efforts withdraw mercenaries and foreign troops, according to French President Emmanuel Macron's office. Harris said Monday she will take part in the conference "to demonstrate our strong support for the people of Libya as they plan for elections." Also expected to attend are Libyan leaders Mohamed el-Manfi, head of the presidential council, Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah and Foreign Minister Najla Mangoush. The conference comes less than six weeks before Libyans are scheduled to cast their ballots in the first round of the presidential elections on Dec. 24. Parliamentary elections are to take place nearly two months later, along with a second round of the presidential vote. The long-awaited vote, however, still faces challenges, including unresolved issues over election laws and occasional infighting among armed groups. Other obstacles include the deep rift that remains between the country's east and west and the presence of thousands of foreign fighters and troops. The U.N. has estimated that there have been at least 20,000 foreign fighters and mercenaries in Libya over the past few years, including Russians, Syrians, Turkish, Sudanese, and Chadians. A leading rights group questioned Thursday whether Libyan authorities can hold free and fair elections. Human Rights Watch criticized what it said were Libya's restrictive laws that undermine freedom of speech and association, as well as the presence of armed groups accused of intimidating, attacking and detaining journalists and political activists. "The main questions leaders at the summit should ask are: can Libyan authorities ensure an environment free of coercion, discrimination, and intimidation of voters, candidates, and political parties?" it said in a statement. In July, the U.N. special envoy for Libya, Jan Kubis, accused "spoilers" of trying to obstruct the vote to unify the divided nation. The Security Council has warned that any individual or group undermining the electoral process could face U.N. sanctions. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said this week, "We want to see an election which the Libyan people can believe in, that is credible, and that is in line with the past agreements." Politicians and warlords in western Libya issued statements this week opposing holding the vote according to the laws ratified by the country's parliament. Khaled al-Meshri, head of Tripoli-based Supreme Council of State, went further and threatened in televised comments to resort to violence to prevent powerful military commander Khalifa Hifter, a potential frontrunner in the presidential race, from taking office if he is elected. Libya's civil war escalated in 2019, as Hifter, who commands the self-styled Libyan Arab Armed Forces, launched an offensive to take Tripoli from armed militias loosely allied with the then U.N.-supported but weak government in the country's capital. Hifter, who was allied with an east-based administration, was backed by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Russia and France. However, his 14-month campaign and march on Tripoli ultimately failed in June 2020, after Qatar and Turkey intensified their military support, with the latter sending mercenaries and troops to help shore up western Libya militias.

Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi discussed means of developing Egypt-France military cooperation during a meeting with French Minister of the Armed Forces Florence Parly in Paris on Friday. El-Sisi, who is visiting France to participate in the international Paris conference on Libya, expressed to Parly his appreciation for the strategic relations between Egypt and France in different domains, especially on security and military matters. The Egyptian president stressed that the forces fighting terrorism need to unify and coordinate their efforts to guarantee a strong and effective response to the threat, Presidential Spokesman Bassam Rady said. For her part, Parly stressed her country's keenness to strengthen partnership with Egypt, particularly military cooperation within the framework of joint counter-terrorism efforts. Egypt is a key pillar of security and stability in the Middle East and Africa, Parly told El-Sisi. The two sides agreed to intensify consultation and coordination to confront and undermine the threat of terrorism, and prevent the movement of terrorists from tension spots to other areas, which threatens security in the region and particularly in North Africa and the Sahel. Both sides agreed on the necessity of supporting the political track to end the crisis in Libya and adhering to the planned timetable for the presidential and parliamentary elections in the country - set to take place on 24 December - in order to hand over power to a legitimate, elected authority by the free will of the Libyan people. They also highlighted that such a step will herald a new page in Libyan history, help restoring the country's national institutions, security and stability, and expel foreign forces from Libyan soil, the statement added.

A delegation of the Peace and Security Council during its visit to Mogadishu (Egyptian Foreign Ministry) Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat A Delegation of the Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the African Union (AU), chaired by Egypt, has concluded a visit to Mogadishu, Somalia. Discussions during the visit focused on bolstering the AU's support to ensure stability in Somalia amid the parliamentary elections. Talks also covered the fate of the troops of the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM). The visit commenced on Nov.8 and was concluded on Nov. 10; it was led by Egypt's Ambassador to Ethiopia and Permanent Representatives to the African Union Mohamed Gad, according to a statement issued by the Egyptian Foreign Ministry. The delegation met with several officials from the Somali government, including President of Somalia Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo and Prime Minister of Somalia Mohamed Hussein Roble. It also convened with Head of AMISOM Francisco Madeira in addition to holding other meetings with the UN mission, foreign missions, and representatives of the civil community and women. The statement said the delegation discussed the political and security developments in the country. Discussions also highlighted means to reach a joint understanding among the federal government, the AU, and the UN towards the arrangements related to AMISOM. AMISOM is expected to withdraw from the country by the end of this year, according to security reports. The AMISOM troops consist of more than 19,000 soldiers and 1,000 policemen. This step represents a red flag since it indicates the return of Al-Shabaab militant group, affiliated with al-Qaeda, as revealed by the Institute for Security Studies (ISS).

News article:
The thaw between Cairo and Doha is being felt most in the economic arena, writes Gamal Essam El-Din Following January’s signing of the Al-Ula agreement which signalled an end to the rift between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt, Egyptian-Qatari rapprochement has been among the fastest to develop. On 1 November, President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi met with Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani on the sidelines of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. It was their second meeting in two months, the first having taken place in late August during the Baghdad Conference on Cooperation and Partnership. The Glasgow meeting was followed by EgyptAir opening a new office in the Qatari capital Doha. EgyptAir’s chairman, Amr Abul-Enein, said “the opening of an EgyptAir office in Doha is a further sign that Egypt-Qatar relations are getting back to normal.” Meanwhile, the ambassadors of Qatar and Egypt have been holding meetings with officials in both countries to promote investment. Following a meeting with Qatari Ambassador to Cairo Salem bin Mubarak Al-Shafi on 22 October, Nevine Gamea, the minister of trade and industry, said the governments of Egypt and Qatar were engaged in “intensive efforts to further political and economic rapprochement”. “We want to push trade exchange higher and boost joint investments between the two countries,” said Gamea. “We have already agreed to form a joint trade committee to examine and follow-up on potential joint investments.” During the meeting Gamea extended an invitation to Qatar’s Trade and Industry Minister Mohamed bin Hamad to visit Cairo to discuss further cooperation. Al-Shafi said Egypt and Qatar are both seeking to consolidate bilateral cooperation. “Egypt offers strategic depth to all countries of the region,” said Al-Shafi. He went on to highlight existing Qatari investments in Egypt, particularly in the financial and real estate sectors, adding that Doha “is serious about pushing them to higher levels”. Immediately following the Al-Ula Agreement an official Qatari delegation visited Cairo to inaugurate a $1.3 billion luxury hotel. Mohamed Abdel-Hamid, deputy chairman of parliament’s Economic Affairs Committee, notes that during the four-year rift between Egypt and Qatar, Qatari investment in-flows continued. “Despite tense relations with Qatar and Turkey — the two main supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood — in recent years, Egypt never adopted an aggressive attitude towards the two countries’ investors.” Semi-official figures suggest that during the years of boycott between Cairo and Doha, Qatar invested around $5 billion in Egypt, mainly in the real estate sector. The Qatari company Diar, which is behind the St Regis Hotel complex in Cairo, maintained Egyptian projects worth $3 billion, while Qatar Petroleum had a major stake in $4.4 billion Egyptian Refining Company which was launched in 2019. Restoring full relations with Qatar will clear the path for increased Qatari investments in Egypt, particularly in the real estate, tourism, petroleum, energy, and banking sectors, says Abdel-Hamid. “Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund has an estimated $300 billion, and private Qatari investors are interested in the Egyptian market which has already attracted large investments from oil-rich Arab Gulf countries,” he said. During a meeting with Minister of Finance Mohamed Maait on 30 October, Al-Shafi said “Egypt has taken measures which make the investment climate very attractive, and we are keen to tap this field.” Maait said Egypt had created an attractive environment for foreign and local investors in national and mega development projects and “the government plans to push the contribution of the private sector — both local and foreign — to economic growth to over 50 per cent in the coming three years.” He added that “Qatari investors could tap into the privatisation when the government acts to enlarge the initial public offering programme by listing more state-owned companies in the coming months.” On 21 October, Minister of Transport Kamel Al-Wazir met with his Qatari counterpart Jassim bin Saif Al-Sulaiti to discuss cooperation between the two countries. Al-Wazir said Egypt would welcome cooperation in the field of maritime transport as the country transforms itself into a hub for global trade and logistics. On 25 October, Egypt’s Ambassador to Doha Amr Al-Sherbini met with Qatar’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sultan bin Saad Al-Muraikhi to discuss ways to boost bilateral cooperation. Despite the thaw in relations between Egypt and Qatar, many in Egypt remain wary of Qatar because of its connections with the Muslim Brotherhood, and the negative coverage Cairo receives from Doha-based Al-Jazeera. Yosri Al-Moghazi, deputy chairman of parliament’s Arab Affairs Committee, said that “though Egypt and Qatar have adopted a pragmatic approach recently, concerns remain over Qatar’s alliance with Muslim Brotherhood and political Islam.” “Cairo’s policy right now is to foster mutually beneficial cooperation with Qatar in the economic and investment spheres, while moving more cautiously on the political front.” Al-Moghazi believes Al-Jazeera’s coverage was a major reason Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Bahrain imposed a blockade on Qatar. “Although the four countries have now restored relations with Qatar Al-Jazeera’s activities remain taboo.” In August, Al-Jazeera began broadcasting live from Cairo for the first time in eight years. Yet sources agree the channel remains suspect because of its negative coverage of events Egypt. “Al-Jazeera is still blacklisted, and its website remains blocked inside Egypt,” said a media source who asked not to be identified. He pointed out that for Al-Jazeera to operate officially in Egypt it must be licensed by the Higher Council for Media Regulation, and for this to happen the channel “needs to radically alter its coverage of Egypt and refrain from defending Islamist movements, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood”. *A version of this article appears in print in the 18 November, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Egypt’s Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry affirmed the necessity to intensify coordination between African countries to eliminate all forms of terrorism, as he addressed the African Union’s Peace and Security Council (PSC) on Monday. Shoukry made the remarks virtually during a session on combating extremist thought and financing terrorism. Egypt is presiding over the PSC in November. Shoukry affirmed that the phenomenon of porous borders requires collective solutions to build a safe, stable, and prosperous Africa. Shoukry also urged serious and urgent cooperation between African countries and regional, continental, and international institutions to confront the growing connection between funding terrorism and other forms of financial crimes. This comes in light of the growing ability of the terrorist groups to collect funding, transfer money across borders, and establish relations with organised crime groups, Shoukry said. Egypt has adopted a comprehensive legislative and regulatory framework to confront terrorism financing that has contributed to undermining the activities of terrorist groups in the country, Shoukry said. The Egyptian top diplomat affirmed the importance Egypt attaches to cooperation with sisterly African countries regarding building human and organisational capacities in different fields. Egypt also spares no effort in sharing its expertise in facing extremist thought, Shoukry said, citing Egypt’s Al-Azhar Observatory for Combating Extremism and the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Combating Unit that provides technical support to counterparts in African states to stop terrorism financing. Focusing on the ideological dimension is one of the most important axes of the comprehensive approach Egypt adopts to confront terrorism, Shoukry said. Based on this, Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi has ordered reforming religious discourse in a way that meets the developments of the time and conforms to moderate and true religious instructions, Shoukry added. Speaking at the fifth high-level African Constitutional Conference in June, President El-Sisi expressed Egypt’s readiness to back African states suffering from the scourge of terrorism as part of its moral and religious responsibility. This responsibility falls under Egypt’s efforts to harness its potential to help its African counterparts, being a “beacon of moderate Islam” globally and as part of its essential role to fight attempts to defame Islam through terrorist crimes, he said. The Peace and Security Council is the AU’s standing decision-making body in charge of preventing, managing and resolving conflicts. The PSC’s powers include ensuring the implementation of key conventions and instruments to counter international terrorism. The PSC consists of 15 non-permanent members elected by the AU Executive Council. Egypt won membership in the PSC for 2020-2022. Earlier in November, Egypt opened the Sahel and Sahara Counterterrorism Centre in Cairo to coordinate the efforts of the 20 Sahel-Saharan states (CEN-SAD) to confront terrorism. The centre will host and organise CEN-SAD’s counterterrorism training. Egypt has already conducted a joint military exercise in the CEN-SAD framework and is providing 1,000 military study grants to candidates from member states. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
On 12 November, Egypt took part in the Paris International Conference on Libya, jointly chaired by Germany, France, and Italy. It was Egypt’s third participation in a major international conference on Libya. President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi also attended the two Berlin conferences on Libya in January 2020 and in June this year. Egypt has also hosted related technical activities on Libya, including meetings of the Constitutional Committee and the 5+5 Joint Military Committee, and sponsored activities related to the economic track and social tracks, including meetings of the Libyan Tribes Forum. These contributions reflect how closely involved Egypt is in the Libyan question. At the Paris conference, President Al-Sisi presented Cairo’s position on Libya, reaffirming fixed principles that include the need to rebuild state institutions which collapsed in the decade following Muammar Gaddafi’s fall. As the country plunged into civil strife Libya became the playground militias, organised crime rings, terrorists and foreign fighters and mercenaries. “The restoration of lasting stability, the realisation of social peace, and the preservation of the national fabric and identity of Libya involves certain mandatory prerequisites. These are to achieve the comprehensive national reconciliation of all Libyan people, to attend to the just distribution of wealth in order to promote comprehensive development across all Libyan regions and to stimulate the economy and ensure the optimum benefit from Libya’s resources so as to meet the aspirations of its people,” said President Al-Sisi. Another prerequisite is to enable Libya to regain its national sovereignty, something which President Al-Sisi said will not happen “until we deal seriously with the presence of mercenaries and foreign fighters on Libyan territory”. The Paris conference served as an expression of international and regional will to eliminate obstacles to the restoration of stability in Libya. Shortly before the conference, Egypt hosted a meeting between Libya’s southern neighbours and the 5+5 Joint Military Committee (JMC) in order to lay the foundations for the restoration of security in southern Libya where tensions and disorder continue to shape an environment conducive to terrorists, foreign mercenaries and fighters and rebel groups. Egypt will soon host a second round of this track. Another major concern President Al-Sisi addressed in Paris was the forthcoming legislative and presidential elections in Libya. He lauded the resolute steps the Libyan Presidency Council, cabinet, and the High Electoral Commission have taken towards this critical juncture, and called on Libyan political forces to set aside narrow factional interests for the sake of the country. Failure to do this “will create a state of popular anger that could cast the situation back to square one,” he said, alluding to Libyan parties that have been working to obstruct the electoral process to further personal and factional ends. Appealing to the Libyans’ patriotic spirit, Al-Sisi said: “The time has come for you, the descendants of Omar Al-Mukhtar, to seek inspiration from the resolve of your forefathers, who made the dearest and most precious sacrifices for the sake of freedom and national self-determination, and expel every foreign interloper regardless of how much they claim their presence is good for you. It is in your own hands to bring good, as long as you overcome your differences and summon the resolve to build your country through the exercise of Libyan free will.” Egypt expects conditions to improve in Libya if it can pass the critical test of legislative and presidential elections on 24 December. Improvement hinges, however, on the continued shift in the balance of forces towards those that favour peace. This is why Egypt has been working impartially, without backing any candidate or side, to help Libyans not just hold free and fair elections but also to accept the result of the polls. A successful Libyan electoral process will relieve Cairo of many political burdens, especially given most of the prominent candidates for president have good relations with Egypt. Turkey’s reluctance to remove the thousands of mercenaries it introduced into Libya remains a major problem. Ankara’s evasiveness was manifested in its reservation on the point regarding the evacuation of foreign fighters and mercenaries in the resolutions adopted in the Berlin II conference, and reflected in the low level of its participation in the Paris conference where it was represented by its deputy foreign minister. French President Emmanuel Macron pointedly mentioned both Russia and Turkey in regard to the problem of foreign mercenaries, though of the two Russia was the more constructive. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a press conference following his visit to Paris on 12 November that Moscow was ready to help remove forces linked to the Russian Wagner Group on condition it is “complete, phased, gradual, and synchronised with regard to both the supporters of Libya’s west and east.” The same principle has also been stressed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The removal of mercenaries and foreign forces will take time, and Cairo rests hopes the Libyan elections will produce an authority capable of taking matters firmly in hand. In terms of Libyan security and national sovereignty, this involves the reunification of the military establishment, the tightening of control over Libya’s borders, and resolve on the part of the government and legislature to take the measures necessary to end the foreign military presence in their country. Egypt is hoping Libya will succeed in safeguarding and building on the political gains made since the October 2020 signing of the ceasefire. Though subsequent progress has been slower than desired, conditions have still improved considerably. There have been a number of interim phases, of which the latest is by far the most hopeful militarily, politically and economically. There have, of course, been bumps along the way, but Egypt trusts this will be the last interim phase on the way to lasting stability. *A version of this article appears in print in the 18 November, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
A report says Israel expects that the upcoming presidential elections in Libya would pave the way for a new normalization agreement with another Arab country, as the main Libyan presidential candidates scramble to maintain contacts with Tel Aviv in order to gain approval of its ally, the United States. Lebanon’s al-Akhbar daily said in a report on Wednesday that Tel Aviv is reassured that the two main presidential candidates, namely Libya's rebel commander General Khalifa Haftar and Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, one of the sons of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, will serve its goal of reaching a normalization agreement with the North African country, but the Israeli regime prefers Haftar as it looks forward to establish a foothold in the Mediterranean basin. Al-Akhbar stressed that the next Libyan regime will join the Persian Gulf Arab states that reached normalization agreements with Tel Aviv last year as the two main presidential candidates seek to appease Tel Aviv as it is considered “a gateway to win satisfaction of Washington,” which would subsequently boost their chance to win the elections and rise to power. The report stressed that the two presidential candidates are ready to normalize ties with Tel Aviv, and that the normalization constitutes an integral part of their undeclared election program, as they prefer not to reveal their policy towards Israel in order to avoid being punished by Libyan voters at the polls since the Libyan people oppose dealing with Israel. Al-Akhbar referred to a recent visit by Saddam, the son of Khalifa Haftar, to Tel Aviv that took place earlier this month during which he met Israeli officials and offered them to enhance Tripoli-Tel Aviv ties, including granting Libya political and military aid, in return for reaching a normalization agreement. The report said Saddam would serve as the de-facto leader of Libya, if his father won the elections. Al-Akhbar also noted that the relations between Tel Aviv and the other presidential candidate dates back to Gaddafi’s time, referring to a report by Israel’s Haaretz daily which said Saif al-Islam led covert ties between Israel and the Gaddafi regime. The report also said that Saif al-Islam has continued to maintain direct and indirect contacts with Tel Aviv after the ouster of his father in 2011 and asked for services in return for a promise of normalization. Al-Akhbar added that Saif al-Islam's advisers, who run his election campaign, recently communicated with Israel. According to al-Akhbar, the contacts between the candidates and Israel are backed by the United Arab Emirates, which is seeking to convince more Arab regimes to follow suit and normalize ties with Israel. Last September, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed controversial normalization agreements with Israel at the White House amid outrage across Palestine and elsewhere throughout the Muslim world over the Arab regimes’ sheer betrayal of the Palestinian cause. A high-ranking Emirati source close to the Libyan presidential candidates told Israel Today that the two Libyan candidates said in “closed conversations with close people” that they would push for normalizing ties with Israel. Al-Akhbar noted that Israel seeks to “achieve more than one strategic interest” through reaching a normalization agreement with Libya and prefers that Khalifa Haftar win the election as he is an ally or “subordinate” to Israel’s allies. According to the report, Libya is of very great importance to Israel as its presence in Tripoli, through Haftar, would “guarantee the removal of the rival Turkish influence in the Mediterranean basin, not only on the security level, but also in terms of its economic security through expanding the circle of its allies, from Cyprus to Greece, and then to Egypt and Libya.” The report said having an influence in Libya, which is rich in resources and which needs reconstruction after a decade of conflict, would make “great economic profits” for Israeli companies. Despite preferring Haftar, al-Akhbar said Israel would not sever its ties with Haftar's rivals in order to secure a way to return in case he failed to win. Libya has been beset by violence and chaos since the overthrow and killing of its long-serving ruler Muammar Gaddafi following a NATO operation in 2011. The conflict has escalated into a regional proxy war fueled by foreign powers pouring weapons and mercenaries into the country. Libya’s presidential elections are scheduled for December 24.

News article:
Libya’s eastern military chief Khalifa Haftar gives a press conference at the local headquarters of the High National Election Commission in the eastern city of Benghazi, on Tuesday (AFP photo) Libya’s eastern military chief Khalifa Haftar gives a press conference at the local headquarters of the High National Election Commission in the eastern city of Benghazi, on Tuesday (AFP photo) (MENAFN- Jordan Times) BENGHAZI, Libya — Wr-scarred Libya's eastern military chief Khalifa Haftar registered on Tuesday to run for president in a December 24 election also contested by a son of former leader Muammar Qadhafi. "I declare my candidacy for the presidential election, not because I am chasing power but because I want to lead our people towards glory, progress and prosperity," Haftar said in a televised speech. Haftar's announcement came two days after Seif Al Islam Qadhafi declared his own candidacy, a decade on from his father's death in a 2011 NATO-backed rebellion. Both are deeply divisive figures. Qadhafi is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, while many in western Libya despise Haftar after his year-long assault on Tripoli, accusing the military commander of seeking to establish a military dictatorship. On Tuesday Haftar vowed to defend "Libya's unity, independence, sovereignty" and called for "reconciliation and peace, construction and stability". Haftar later officially submitted his bid at an electoral board office, where he told journalists: "The next stage will be difficult. I call on all Libyans to make the right choice, one they will not regret." His candidacy marks the latest stage in Haftar's dramatic trajectory from exile in the United States to becoming one of the most controversial figures in Libya's 10-year conflict. From 2014, he led a three-year battle against extremists in Benghazi, establishing himself as the dominant power in the country's east. In April 2019, backed by Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, he launched an offensive on Tripoli on the pretext of rooting out militant groups. The year-long battle left the outskirts of the capital in ruins and Libya more divided than ever. But a United Nations-brokered ceasefire in October last year paved the way for a peace process leading to elections set for December 24. 'Huge' problems In September, Haftar provisionally quit his military position in line with a controversial electoral law to allow him to run for president. On Tuesday, wearing a formal suit and tie instead of his military uniform, he said the vote is "the only way to pull Libya out of chaos". Libya's electoral process, already beset by disputes over who can stand and the legal basis for the polls, looks as shaky as ever just six weeks ahead of the vote. On Monday evening, the head of the UN-backed unity government Abdulhamid Dbeibah said the process was facing "huge" problems given the lack of laws and consensus over a constitutional framework for the vote. Last week, Haftar's forces said 300 mercenaries fighting on his side would leave Libya at the request of France in a "unilateral gesture", expecting nothing in return from the government in Tripoli. But pro-Haftar forces remain in control of much of eastern and southern Libya, and some analysts have voiced scepticism over the chances of a free and fair vote. Analyst Khaled Al Montasir said Haftar had "imposed himself on the political scene, but he will remain a controversial figure rejected by many in western and southern Libya". "Moreover, there's no guarantee that any election process that brings him to power will be respected," he told AFP. 'Major threat' Other analysts warned of the potential for intimidation or worse from Haftar loyalists. "Haftar's forces have by far been Libya's leading perpetrators of war crimes since 2014, and are bound to use intimidation or worse to influence the elections," tweeted Wolfram Lacher, a Libya specialist at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. Next month's election is seen by the international community as a key step in restoring stability to Libya after a decade of conflict since the overthrow of Qadhafi in a NATO-backed uprising. But the path to the ballot box has been lined with disputes over the constitutional basis for the polls and the powers to be given to whoever wins. Many observers have warned there are no guarantees either side will respect the result of the election. "Haftar claimed in 2018 Libya was 'not ripe for democracy', and last August that his military forces would not be subject to any political authority, civilian or otherwise," Anas Al Gomati, director of Libya-based think tank the Sadeq Institute, told AFP. "This is a major threat to the political transition moving forward."

News article:
President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi said on Tuesday that Egypt’s presidency of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa bloc (COMESA) aims to achieve regional integration by developing intra-regional trade, as well as leveraging the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). The president made his remarks as he chaired the 21st Summit of the COMESA’s Heads of State and Government, which kicked off today at Egypt’s New Administrative Capital (NAC). El-Sisi underscored the necessity of introducing exemptions to customs as agreed upon within the framework of the AfCFTA. He highlighted his proposal to set up a mechanism to review the trade policies of member states on a periodic basis to ensure the effective implementation of customs privileges. Earlier during the opening session of the summit, President El-Sisi took over the chairmanship of the COMESA from President of Madagascar Andry Rajoelina. The COMESA was founded in December 1994 — replacing the Preferential Trade Area that had existed since 1981 — as an organisation of free independent sovereign states which agreed to cooperate in developing their natural and human resources for the good of all their peoples. According to COMESA, the summit is held under the theme: “Building Resilience Through Strategic Digital Economic Integration,” and "aims to rally the 21 member states on how to safeguard and advance the COMESA regional integration agenda using digital platforms to facilitate doing business and enhance their resilience to face the economic repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic." Egypt is assuming the presidency of the summit for the first time since 2001. Zambia hosted the last COMESA summit in Lusaka in 2018. “Egypt will seek to follow up on this mechanism in cooperation with the COMESA’s general secretariat and member states,” El-Sisi said. He added that Egypt will strive to promote continental integration and highlight the progress made within the framework of the regional integration of COMESA, the East African Community, and the Southern African Development Community. Egypt will also work on encouraging the countries that signed the AfCFTA agreement to start enforcing its terms, he said. The AfCFTA agreement — which was signed in March 2018 in Rwanda to become the world’s largest free-trade area — came into effect on 1 January 2021. AfCFTA, which created a market of 1.2 billion people, is the eighth largest economic bloc in the world. It has a combined GDP of $3 trillion that is expected to more than double by 2050, according to the African Union (AU). Thirty-nine states out of the 55 members of the AU have ratified the AfCFTA agreement with the aim of accelerating intra-African trade and boosting Africa’s trading position in the global market by strengthening the continent’s common voice and policy space in global trade negotiations. El-Sisi underscored the necessity of stepping up cooperation in various manufacturing sectors and benefiting from the resources available to the countries of the region, particularly in light of the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic. In September, El-Sisi called during his speech to the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) for debt relief for developing countries, especially African and middle-income states, in light of the economic repercussions of the pandemic. “The African continent has become the most affected by the coronavirus at a time when its peoples are facing other challenges that are not less serious than the pandemic,” El-Sisi said. During his speech on Tuesday, El-Sisi said that the pandemic negatively affected the flow of regional and international supply chains. He stressed that these chains will be reshaped according to the ability of national economies to recover. The availability of competitive capabilities in African countries will also play a role also in reshaping regional and international supply chains, El-Sisi added. He urged the COMESA’s member states to make use of current conditions to deepen industrial cooperation. El-Sisi said that Egypt has prepared an initiative for regional industrial integration with the aim of participating with member states and the general secretariat to draw up an executive plan to achieve this integration and increase productivity under the slogan ‘Made in COMESA.’ The Egyptian initiative goes in line with the COMESA’s 2017-2026 Industrial Strategy and the 2063 African Development Agenda, the Egyptian president assured. The initiative aims to study the resources available to the bloc’s countries and to determine the relative advantages available to them in order to integrate the targeted industrial sectors into regional and international value chains. Furthermore, El-Sisi called on the COMESA’s member states and the general secretariat to make use of the Egyptian initiative and develop an executive plan on the short-and long-term to back the industrial sector and the business community in COMESA. Infrastructure integration, promoting investment Egypt will also work on ramping up economic integration in the infrastructure sectors, especially transportation, energy, communications, and information technology, El-Sisi said. He highlighted Egypt’s readiness to cooperate with all member states of the COMESA in all these sectors in light of the leap Egypt achieved in this respect over the past years. The Egyptian president also stressed the importance of infrastructure integration between the bloc’s countries to ensure the promotion of intra-regional trade and the movement of goods, commodities, and production elements. Egypt is encouraging land-linkage projects between African countries, most notably the Cairo-Cape Town Project that is set to traverse through most of the countries of the COMESA, he added. The country is also looking to finalise a feasibility study to establish a naval route linking Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean through the Nile River, El-Sisi pointed out. “It is one of the ambitious projects that will facilitate the movement of trade and the movement of individuals between the countries of the region,” he said Launched in 2013, the naval linkage project is one of the regional projects sponsored by the New Partnership for Africa’s Development’s Presidential Infrastructure Development Initiative. Egypt is leading this project with the participation of all Nile Basin countries, including Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. The venture includes a navigation route, a road, a railway, an electric connection, and an information cable to achieve the comprehensive development of the Nile Basin’s countries. El-Sisi said the lack of data needed for investment opportunities stands in the way of promoting regional investment. He noted that Egypt will encourage the group’s general secretariat to cooperate with member states to prepare a list of clear investment opportunities to be presented to the business community and financing institutions. Such a step will contribute to increasing economic growth rates and creating more job opportunities for the citizens of the region, he said. Healthcare integration The Egyptian president urged enhancing the integration of the healthcare sectors of the COMESA's member states, especially amid the coronavirus pandemic. He called for conducting an urgent study and developing a clear plan to guarantee easy access to medical and pharmaceutical products among the member states. Furthermore, El-Sisi called for raising awareness among African citizens to benefit from vaccines in order to curtail the spread of the pandemic across the region. In his speech to the 76th session of the UNGA, El-Sisi highlighted that Egypt has been keen to localise coronavirus vaccine manufacturing “not only to meet the needs of its citizens, but also to export doses to the African continent.” “The current circumstances have only exacerbated a reality that has been perpetuated for decades: insufficient regional and international cooperation,” El-Sisi told the UN body, as he called for expanding the scope of international support to the developing world to cover middle-income countries. Improving the business environment The president reaffirmed on Tuesday that Egypt is eager to overcome any obstacles hampering the movement of business in the bloc given its belief that business integration is an urgent necessity to accelerate the pace of recovery from the pandemic. “The business community is the main actor and the most important beneficiary of the COMESA Common Market Treaty,” he stressed. Egypt will strive during its presidency of the COMESA to stimulate all initiatives that contribute to facilitating the business environment, especially digital transformation and financial inclusion initiatives. The country will also encourage the movement of intra-private sector investments in different sectors, he added. Egypt and the COMESA According to a report released by the Egyptian Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics (CAPMAS) on Tuesday, Egyptian exports to COMESA countries increased by 32.4 percent in 2021, recording $2.3 billion during the first nine months of the year, compared to the $1.7 billion recorded in the same period during 2020. Imports to Egypt from COMESA member states amounted to $901 million in the first nine months of 2021, an increase of 25 percent compared to $721 million in the same period in 2020. Furthermore, the trade exchange between Egypt and COMESA’s countries increased to $3.1 billion during the first nine months in 2021, a noticeable increase from the $2.4 billion recorded in the same period in 2020. Egypt will increase the engagement of the Egyptian business community with the COMESA’s member states to benefit from the advantages offered by the economic bloc and will also develop inter-trade, the president noted. The COMESA is a major marketplace for both internal and external trading. It is comprised of 21 member states with a population of over 583 million people and a combined GDP of $805 billion. Its contribution to the global export/import trade of goods is valued at $324 billion. The COMESA covers almost two thirds of the African continent with an area of 12 million square kilometres.

Egypt is continuing efforts to develop its partnership with the EU and explore new vistas of cooperation that serve its development process and ability to address challenges, provide jobs and improve living conditions, Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said on Monday. Speaking to MENA on the sidelines of the sixth regional conference of the foreign ministers of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) in Barcelona, Shoukry said the Egyptian partnership with the EU, either in the political or economic domains, is profound, varied and serves both sides. As one of the founders of the UfM, Egypt is keen on taking part in all the activities of the union because they serve both the northern and southern Mediterranean countries in the political, economic and cultural fields, Shoukry said. Shoukry underlined the union’s important role in boosting cooperation between Mediterranean countries in accordance with set priorities that include preserving the environment in the Mediterranean region, referring to Egypt's preparations for hosting the 27th climate change conference (COP 27). On the sidelines of the conference, Minister Shoukry discussed with his Finnish counterpart Pekka Haavistoon a wide range of issues of mutual concern. Earlier on Monday, Shoukry met with his Slovenian counterpart Anže Logar and they discussed bilateral relations and regional and international issues of mutual interest. The Egyptian FM also met with a number of European and Arab officials and top diplomats, including the European Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Olivér Várhelyi and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell.

News article:
A Palestinian journalist imprisoned by Israel without trial is in poor health after nearly 50 days on hunger strike, his wife said on Monday. "He is vomiting blood and has lost 25 kilograms (55 pounds)," Mohammed al-Qiq's wife, Fayha Shalash, told AFP. She said that if he loses consciousness she believes his doctors will feed him intravenously. A controversial Israeli law passed in July allows the force-feeding of prisoners in certain circumstances, though it has not yet been invoked. Qiq, a 33-year-old reporter for Saudi TV channel Al Majd, was arrested on November 21 at his home in the West Bank city of Ramallah and in mid-December placed under administrative detention, which allows imprisonment without trial for six-month periods renewable indefinitely. He began a hunger strike on November 25, alleging torture by his captors and is currently in the hospital wing of Ramle prison, in central Israel. He was jailed in 2008 for 16 months for student activism which Israel says was linked to Islamist militant group Hamas. Palestinians have regularly gone on hunger strike to protest administrative detentions.

News article:
PCHR Condemns Application of Force-Feeding against Administrative Detainee, Journalist Mohammed al-Qeeq Ref: 03/2016 In an unprecedented step on Tuesday, 12 January 2016, Israeli forces applied the force-feeding law against the administrative detainee, journalist Mohammed al-Qeeq, who has been on a hunger strike for about 50 days. Al-Qeeq was handcuffed and then forcibly administrated intravenous fluids. The Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR) is gravely concerned over the risks that may result from force-feeding al-Qeeq. Moreover, PCHR calls upon the international community to promptly intervene to save his life and stop force-feeding. It should be noted that the Israeli Parliament (Knesset) approved on 30 July 2015 in the second and third reading of the amendment to the so-called “Law to Prevent Harm of Hunger Strike”, which PCHR warned of its consequences at that time and demanded its immediate annulment. Many international bodies have also warned of the adoption of such law, which is considered by the United Nations Special Rapporteur against torture as means of torture, and by the Special Rapporteur on the right to health as a serious violation. Mohammed Usamah al-Qeeq (33) has been on an open hunger strike since 25 November 2015 in protest against placing him under 6-month administrative detention. Al-Qeeq has since refused to eat or undergo medical tests, so his health status deteriorated. Therefore, Al-Qeeq was taken to al-Afoulah Hospital in Israel and is still there, as his health condition is getting worse. Human rights sources reported that he suffers from permanent headache and pains in the stomach and joints, vomits blood and lost 13 kilograms. It should be mentioned that on 21 November 2015, Al-Qeeq, Correspondent at al-Majd Saudi Channel, was arrested from his house in Ramallah. He was then subjected to tough interrogation, during which he was exposed to torture, including shackling (Shabeh), before being placed under administrative detention. Therefore, he started a hunger strike. PCHR is concerned over the life of Mohammed al-Qeeq, and: Calls upon the international community to pressurize the Israeli forces to stop all attempts to forcibly feed him fearing for his life; Reiterates its call upon the international community to urgently move to stop the Israeli serious and systematic abuses against the Palestinian detainees in the Israeli prisons; Emphasizes that administrative detention is illegal and falls under the category of political arrests, constituting a violation of the detainee’s right to a fair trial, including his right to receive an adequate defense and to be informed of the charges against him; and Stresses that the force-feeding is considered as a form of torture and degrading treatment under the international law.

News article:
A Palestinian journalist who went on hunger strike 50 days ago over his six-month detention without trial in an Israeli prison is in critical condition, his family says. Muhammed al-Qeq, who was arrested by Israel’s internal security agency Shin Bet in November, is the first journalist to protest extrajudicial detention by refusing food. His father revealed shocking details of al-Qeq’s health, saying “he is about to die now, and he vomits and urinates blood.”The only way to save al-Qeq’s life, his father said, is to set him free. “For those who have consciences, and [also] human rights organizations in the west and east, please try to save the life of my son and grandsons,” he appealed. Al-Qeq, 33, was arrested on November 21 by Israel’s Shin Bet security service, which accused him of links to Hamas. Seven weeks ago he launched a hunger strike in protest at being detained without charges or due legal process, refusing food and drinking only water. Al-Qeq’s wife, Faiha’a Shalash, has told RT the Israelis arrested him in his house in Ramallah, citing as justification alleged media incitement to violence. She said al-Qeq was made to suffer inhuman and degrading treatment while in an Israeli detention center. “We knew that he was subject to all kinds of threat and torture methods, like being beaten on a small chair when he was handcuffed and blindfolded for long hours,” his wife said. “They insulted and shouted at him in a humiliating manner and he was but in a very small prison that is not suitable to a human being. He also was threatened with sexual assault […] and internment for seven years if he doesn’t admit his accusation of incitement to violence.” Shalash, who is a journalist herself, said the accusation of incitement to violence does not fit with reality and “depends on news reports made by Muhammed as a journalist and as it was his work.” She is confident al-Qeq was detained because he described the Israelis as an occupying force committing crimes against humanity in the West Bank. Al-Qeq’s brother, Hamam, added: “It is about showing the reality in Palestine objectively, Israel doesn’t want a Palestinian journalist to show the reality to the international community objectively.”

News article:
JERUSALEM (JTA) — Meir Ettinger, whom Israeli authorities say oversees a Jewish terrorist group, has gone on a hunger strike to protest his administrative detention. Ettinger, the grandson of the slain far-right activist Meir Kahane, began his protest Wednesday. He was placed in detention on Aug. 15, nearly two weeks after his arrest. He reportedly was transferred recently to solitary confinement and has limited, monitored contact with his family. He was arrested for “involvement in violent activities and terrorist attacks that occurred recently, and his role as part of a Jewish terrorist group,” according to Israeli authorities. His arrest was linked to the firebombing of a home in the West Bank Palestinian village of Duma that left an infant and his parents dead. Three people, including two minors, have been charged in connection with the attack. Shin Bet officials have said Ettinger heads a movement that also was responsible for the June arson of the historic Church of the Multiplication of the Loaves and Fishes, and seeks to bring down the government and replace it with a Jewish theocracy. Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein approved the order for a six-month detention issued by Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon against Ettinger. The Lod District Court in mid-September upheld the order. Under administrative detention, which is more commonly used for Palestinian prisoners, one can be held for six months without being charged or tried. The order can be renewed indefinitely. Ettinger does not have American citizenship. His mother, Tova, Kahane’s daughter, made aliyah from the United States.

News article:
A Palestinian journalist on a two-month-long hunger strike in an Israeli jail could die at any minute, his attorney warned on Monday. Mohammed al-Qiq’s health is “very, very bad,” lawyer Jawad Boulus told AFP after a visit on Sunday. “He faces the possibility of death at any moment.” Qiq, a 33-year-old father of two and a correspondent for Saudi Arabia’s Almajd TV network, was arrested on November 21 of last year at his home in the West Bank city of Ramallah and is being held under Israel’s controversial administrative detention measure, which allows indefinite detention without trial for terror suspects. Detainees can appeal their detention to the High Court of Justice, but do not receive due-process trials. Several hundred Palestinian terror suspects are believed to be held by Israel, along with a handful of Israeli Jewish suspects arrested in recent months for suspected anti-Arab terror activity. Qiq has been refusing food since November 25 in protest over the “torture and ill-treatment that he was subjected to during interrogation,” according to Addameer, a Palestinian rights group. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms After 61 days since his strike began, Qiq’s organs are said to be at risk of failure. The Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic security service, alleges Qiq is an active member of the Islamist terror group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip. “We refuse to accept the purported security excuses for keeping the reasons for his administrative detention secret,” said MK Osama Sa’adi, of the Joint (Arab) List, of Qiq’s continued incarceration. Advertisement “It’s inconceivable that a television reporter and a normative person can sit in prison without trial or [proof of] guilt. Those who decided to jail Mohammed al-Qiq will be responsible for his death. If we reach that point, there will be chaos here. That’s why I demand he be released immediately and unconditionally,” Sa’adi said in a statement Monday. The administrative detention policy has been condemned by human rights advocates abroad, and more recently by right-wing Israeli groups, which railed at the incarceration without charges of far-right activists. Qiq was transferred to hospital in the Israeli city of Afula about a month ago, said a spokeswoman of the Israel Prisons Service. His family has said they expect Israel to feed him intravenously if he loses consciousness, though Israeli authorities have denied they will force-feed him. A controversial Israeli law passed in July allows the force-feeding of prisoners in certain circumstances, though it has yet to be invoked. Top Palestinian Authority official Saeb Erekat told AFP that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “personally bears responsibility for al-Qiq’s life.” Advertisement Qiq was jailed for a month in 2003 and then for 13 months in 2004. In 2008, he was sentenced to 16 months on charges linked to his activities on the student council at the West Bank’s Birzeit University. Mohammed Allan, a 31-year-old prisoner whom Israel accuses of being a leader of the Islamic Jihad terror group, ended a two-month hunger strike in August 2015 after his detention without charges was suspended.

News article:
Palestinian journalist Muhammad al-Qiq, who has been on hunger strike in Israeli jail for 61 days, is on brink of death, the journalist's lawyer told Ma'an. After a visit with al-Qiq on Monday, Ashraf Abu Sneina, a lawyer from the Palestinian Authority's commission of detainees and ex-detainee affairs, said al-Qiq is unconscious and cannot speak, adding that he has exhibited "sudden symptoms that could lead to his death." The head of the committee, Issa Qaraqe, accused Israel of “reckless and indifferent treatment of al-Qiq,” which stems from “a decision by the extremist Israeli government and its intelligence to let him die.” The 33-year-old journalist from the southern West Bank town of Dura has been on hunger strike to protest his administrative detention -- internment without trial or charge -- since Nov. 24. Qaraqe called on all appropriate organizations and human rights groups to exert every means available to pressure Israel to free al-Qiq, "because if he dies as a martyr, the situation will deteriorate both among Palestinians inside and out of Israeli prisons." “Israel has to be aware that it will pay a heavy toll if Muhammad dies in custody,” Qaraqe said. While possible evidence against al-Qiq is still being withheld, Amnesty International reported on Jan. 23 that the military judge at the Ofer Military Court said the file against him “accuses him of ‘incitement,’ of working with media associated with Hamas, a Palestinian political faction with an armed wing, and also of being a ‘threat to the security of the area.’" Following the report, Mahmoud Ulayyan, a member of Gaza's journalism union, said he believes al-Qiq is inarguably being held due to his work as a journalist, and that Palestinian journalists urgently need protection from the "continuous Israeli violations" launched against them. In their report, Amnesty International demanded that Israel either release or charge al-Qiq, who the group said has been mistreated and tortured in ways that violate international law. On Jan. 19, medical rights group Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI), said the group had found that doctors in HaEmek Hospital in Afula, where al-Qiq is being treated, were "forcing treatment upon (al-Qiq) and pressuring him to end his hunger strike." PHRI called on doctors to stop the "forced treatment" and respect international human rights law, which says hunger strikers cannot be forced or pressured to intake food or supplements. The group said the hunger striker had been "hooked up against his will to an infusion of salts and vitamins, and blood was taken with the permission of the hospital's ethics committee." "Al-Qiq was tied to the bed and forcefully held down by prison wardens while a member of the medical staff made the infusion. For four days al-Qiq remained tied to the bed, hooked up to the IV drip, while pleading for its removal, to no avail," the group said at the time. Eventually doctors did remove the drip, however PHRI still said that their actions "contradict(ed) the World Medical Association's declarations on hunger strikers, to which medical personnel in Israel are committed, including the Malta Declaration which forbids both applying pressure to end a hunger strike and forced medical treatment." Last week, Israeli media reported that the chairman of the Israeli Medical Association World Fellowship announced at an Israeli Knesset meeting that 71 UK doctors had called on the World Medical Association to expel the Israeli Medical Association from the body, claiming that Israeli doctors have carried out “medical torture” on Palestinians.

News article:
The PLO has called for the unconditional release of a Palestinian journalist in Israeli custody whose 62-day hunger strike has brought him close to death ahead of an appeal by the prisoner’s lawyers before Israel’s Supreme Court this week. Muhammad al-Qiq, a 33-year-old journalist from the southern West Bank town of Dura, went on hunger strike on Nov. 24, 2015 to protest his administrative detention — interment without charge or trial in Israeli prison. PLO Executive Committee member Hanan Ashrawi said in a statement Monday that Israel must release him immediately, condemning the “unlawful practice of administrative detention” as well as “severe and unjust acts of torture” committed by Israel’s prison authorities. Ashrawi said the executive committee supported al-Qiq as well as all other Palestinian prisoners who have launched strikes against their detention. “They embody a selfless struggle for justice and independence in Palestine, and expose the brutality and criminality of the continued military occupation, particularly in relation to the thousands of Palestinian men, women and children prisoners in Israeli jails,” she said. The Israeli Supreme Court is set to hear an appeal for al-Qiq’s release on Wednesday at 11:30 a.m., the Palestinian Authority’s Committee for Prisoners’ Affairs said. The journalist’s lawyers will speak out against his administrative detention, under which hundreds of Palestinian political detainees are currently being held. The committee warned that any further deterioration of al-Qiq’s health or his potential death could have far-reaching consequences for Israel politically, including popular unrest among Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. The committees’ head, Issa Qaraqe, warned again Tuesday that Israel’s prison authorities may still take the decision to force-feed al-Qiq, in what would be the first use of the controversial practice since it was approved by Israeli lawmakers last year. A lawyer for the committee, Ashraf Abu Sneina, told Ma’an on Monday after visiting al-Qiq that the journalist was unconscious and unable to speak, adding that he had exhibited “sudden symptoms that could lead to his death.” Initially detained on Nov. 21, 2015, an Israeli military judge confirmed al-Qiq’s administrative detention on Dec. 30, 2015, and an appeal filed against his detention was rejected by the Ofer Military Court on Jan. 17. While the Israeli authorities have suggested that al-Qiq is being held “incitement,” working with Hamas-affiliated media, and being a “threat to security,” Amnesty International said last week that withholding al-Qiq on secret evidence was unlawful. An investigation by the rights group also revealed that al-Qiq had been mistreated and tortured during his administrative detention. Physicians for Human Rights Israel reported that doctors in the hospital where al-Qiq is being held had “forced” medical treatment on the prisoner. They said the action did not amount to force-feeding but was still a violation of international law. Some 45 Palestinian prisoners affiliated to the leftist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) being held in the Megiddo and Gilboa prisons meanwhile began a two-day strike Tuesday in an act of solidarity with al-Qiq. The Handala Center for Palestinian Prisoners and Former Prisoners said that the 45 prisoners launched the strike in ab attempt to apply pressure on Israel to release al-Qiq, as well as the end to the solitary confinement of prisoner Bilal Kayid. Kayyid, who has spent over 14 years in Israeli prison, is being held in a “putrid cell without ventilation, light or proper winter blankets,” the prisoners’ center said. It added that Kayid was recently transferred from Mediggo prison to solitary confinement in Ashkelon prison where he has been denied sleep and family visits. Palestinian prisoners of Israel frequently stage hunger strikes against poor prison conditions and the conditions of their detention, with several detainees coming close to death before reaching eventual deals with the Israeli authorities.

News article:
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says a Palestinian prisoner, who has been on a hunger strike for the past 64 days, "has entered a critical stage", PressTV reports. Mohammed al-Qiq's life is "at risk," the body warned on Thursday, referring to the 33-year-old journalist, who was arrested in the city of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank in November last year. The father of two, who used to work for Saudi Arabia's Almajd TV network, has been accused by Israel's Shin Bet internal spy service of "terror activity" involving the Palestinian resistance movement, Hamas. The Palestinian journalist denied the charges and began the hunger strike after facing torture during interrogation. The ICRC called on his Israeli captors "to find a solution that will avoid any loss of life." Qiq's wife, Faihaa, has also argued against his wrongful detention, saying that "Mohammed is a Palestinian journalist, who was only covering the situation in the West Bank and he was arrested because of it." The occupied Palestinian territories have been witnessing escalating tensions sparked by Israeli violations against the al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Over 160 Palestinians, including women and children, have been killed by Israeli forces since October 2015 amid the escalation. On Wednesday, Israel's Supreme Court overturned Qiq's appeal against his incarceration. Also on Wednesday, the European Union said it was "especially concerned" about the prisoner's deteriorating health. Israeli forces also carried out 574 attacks against reporters during the course of the last year, the Annual Report by the Palestine Office of the Islamic Radios and Televisions Union recently pointed out. Detentions, extension of detention periods, and the issuance of subpoenas comprised 85 of the cases.

News article:
Israel's Supreme Court on Thursday suspended the detention without trial of a Palestinian journalist who has been on hunger strike for more than two months, but he cannot leave hospital without permission. Mohammed al-Qiq, 33, was said to be on hunger strike for 72 days to protest being held under Israel's controversial administrative detention law, which allows the state to hold suspects for renewable six-month periods without trial. The court said the order was being suspended due to his poor health. His family will be allowed to visit him in hospital. Qiq's lawyer said the journalist had earlier pledged to refuse any order that "doesn't guarantee his freedom". "I'm going to visit him now to know his decision," said Jawad Boulus. The International Committee of the Red Cross said last week that Qiq's life was in danger. Qiq, a father of two and a correspondent for Saudi Arabia's Almajd TV network, was arrested on November 21 at his home in the West Bank city of Ramallah. He has been refusing food since November 25 in protest against the "torture and ill treatment that he was subjected to during interrogation", according to Addameer, a Palestinian rights organization. Israel's Supreme Court previously refused to order his release, although it said it would follow his health on a daily basis. Shin Bet, the Israeli domestic security service, says Qiq was arrested for "terror activity" as part of the Islamist group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip. Qiq was jailed for a month in 2003 and then for 13 months in 2004 for Hamas-related activities. In 2008, he was sentenced to 16 months on charges linked to his activities on the student council at the West Bank's Birzeit University.

A Palestinian journalist on hunger strike to protest his detention in Israel has rejected a compromise that would have seen him transferred to a hospital in East Jerusalem, saying he will only stop his fast if he is sent to a Palestinian medical facility. Mohammed al-Qiq had been given until Tuesday morning to decide whether to accept a High Court decision which would allow him to be transferred to East Jerusalem’s al-Makassed Hospital. Al-Qiq, who was arrested and held by Israel without charge under administrative detention, is currently being treated at Haemek hospital in the Israeli town of Afula in the Lower Galilee. “There is no difference between Afula and al-Makassed hospital for al-Qiq,” Ahmad Abu Muhammad of the Palestinian Prisoners Society told the Palestinian Ma’an news agency.“If he decides to go to Jerusalem, they will take him, put two or three soldiers by his bed … it will be exactly the same.” Al-Qiq’s lawyers had petitioned the High Court Monday for him to be transferred to a hospital in Ramallah, under Palestinian control.

The 33-year-old is reported to be close to death after 83 days of a hunger strike to protest his administrative detention by Israel.

Qiq, a father of two and a correspondent for Saudi Arabia’s Almajd TV network, was arrested at his home in Ramallah on November 21. He has been refusing food since November 25 in protest against the “torture and ill treatment that he was subjected to during interrogation,” according to Addameer, a Palestinian rights organization. The United Nations has expressed concern about his fate, while the International Committee of the Red Cross describes his condition as critical.

'He said, "it's death or freedom, and if Israeli security has something against me, it must bring me to justice, rather than hold me under administrative detention without trial or charge".'

News article:
The Israel Prisons Service tried a new approach Monday to persuade hunger-striking Palestinian journalist Mohammed al-Qiq to end his fast — bringing in two high-ranking Hamas prisoners to make the case, the Walla news website reported, quoting Palestinian sources. Jamal Abu al-Hija and Muhammad Shariach were taken under heavy guard to the Emek Medical Center in the northern city of Afula, where al-Qiq is into his 90th day of refusing food. The two apparently asked him to end his hunger strike. Jamal Abu al-Hija was arrested in 2002 and sentenced to nine life sentences for involvement in at least six bombings — including the Meron Junction attack that killed nine Israelis in 2002, and the Jerusalem Sbarro pizzeria bombing that killed 15 in 2001. The 33-year-old al-Qiq was arrested and held by Israel without charge on November 21, 2015, under administrative detention. He has refused food since November 25. Qiq, whose condition has been rapidly deteriorating, rejected an Israeli offer earlier this month to transfer him to East Jerusalem’s al-Maqased Hospital, saying he would only end his fast if he is sent to a medical facility in the West Bank, under Palestinian Authority jurisdiction.

The Shin Bet security service says Qiq was detained under the controversial administrative detention directive for activity on behalf of the Palestinian terror group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip. He denies this. Hundreds of protesters last week gathered outside the Emek Medical Center to demand Qiq’s immediate release from Israeli custody.

News article:
Palestinian journalists wearing mock Israeli prison uniforms hold a rally in solidarity with their hunger-striking colleague Muhammad al-Qiq, in Gaza City on 24 February. Mohammed Asad APA images Muhammad al-Qiq’s body has collapsed and his heart rate has slowed, lawyers report, as the 33-year-old Palestinian journalist and father of two enters day 92 of his hunger strike against his detention by Israel without charge or trial. Meanwhile, Israel is still refusing to allow al-Qiq’s wife Fayha Shalash and their two young children to be with him during what is feared may be his final hours. On Tuesday, Shalash spoke by telephone from the occupied West Bank to a solidarity rally for her husband in the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott. “Muhammad al-Qiq did not go on strike to harm himself or to hurt his two children who wait for him minute by minute, but rather to tell the Israelis: our decision is to live free or to die with dignity,” Shalash said. “This is the message of every Palestinian to the world,” Shalash added. No negotiations Since Sunday, all negotiations between al-Qiq and Israel have ceased. Jawad Bolous, the head of the Palestinian Prisoners Club, said Israel’s failure to respond to al-Qiq’s final compromise forced them to “cease following up on the case.” Al-Qiq’s family said he is now “in God’s hands.” Issa Qaraqe, the Palestinian Authority head of prisoner affairs, said that Israel’s silence was proof of its “deliberate intention” to let al-Qiq die. Qaraqe suggested that Israel may be trying to make an example of al-Qiq for other Palestinian prisoners. “The Israelis apparently decided to put an end to this wave of strikes,” he told Al Jazeera. “A prisoner may pay his life for it, but for [the Israelis] it would be a message delivered.” Pressure While direct negotiations have ended, Israel brought two high-ranking Hamas prisoners under heavy guard to al-Qiq’s bedside on Monday. This was reported by the Hebrew website Local Call, as well as by Palestinian media. While there has been no announcement of the purpose of the visit, reports claimed the men told al-Qiq that the Hamas leadership was not interested in individual hunger strikes at present and that the organization feared his death would escalate the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories. In other words, their goal was likely to convince al-Qiq to accept terms for ending his hunger strike. But al-Qiq, who has been arrested by the Palestinian Authority and Israel for alleged involvement with Hamas several times in the past, remains on strike. Al-Qiq has maintained that he would not end his strike unless he was transferred to a hospital in the occupied West Bank. However, last weekend he agreed to be transferred to a Palestinian hospital in occupied East Jerusalem on condition the Israeli authorities promised his administrative detention order would not be renewed. When Israel’s high court initially offered to transfer al-Qiq to al-Makassed hopsital earlier this month, he refused, stating he would not break his strike until he was free. “Pick up the phone” Human rights groups, including Amnesty International and B’Tselem, have called Israel’s detention of al-Qiq unlawful and demanded his immediate release. Martina Anderson, an Irish member of the European parliament and the chair of the European Union’s delegation to Palestine, called on the European Union to intervene on behalf of Muhammad al-Qiq. “Al-Qiq is undertaking this strike for all Palestinian prisoners,” Anderson said. “He is hunger-striking in protest at being detained without charge and against being tortured.” I raised the case of Mohammed Al-Qiq Palestinian Journalist on hunger strike for 92 days - he is dying @SFIntDept pic.twitter.com/1z3lxAfuEk — MEP Martina Anderson (@M_AndersonSF) February 24, 2016 But doctors and lawyers fear that any intervention at this point may be too late to reverse the damage the last three months without food has wreaked on his body. In Belfast on Wednesday, youth activists from the political party Sinn Féin joined Palestine solidarity activists to hold a vigil in solidarity with al-Qiq at the city’s International Wall.

Israeli F-15 fighter jets again escorted American B-1B bombers through the region for the second time in a month, the Israeli military says, in a tacit threat to Iran. According to the Israel Defense Forces, the Israeli fighter jets accompanied two B-1B heavy bombers and a KC-10 refueling jet through Israeli airspace today as they made their way west from the Persian Gulf. “The joint flight demonstrates our continued cooperation, which is crucial to the security of Israel and the Middle East,” the IDF says. Late last month, Israeli F-15s escorted a B-1B bomber as it made its way to the Gulf. The escort mission comes as Israeli and American officials have increasingly threatened to act against Tehran’s nuclear program, as Iran has stalled its indirect negotiations with the United States in Vienna regarding a mutual return to the 2015 nuclear deal.

Here's What You Need to Remember: Eleven Iranian patrol boats acted dangerously near a group of U.S. Navy craft in April 2020. Armed speedboats belonging to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy habitually harass U.S. Navy and allied vessels in the Persian Gulf, in particular in the strategic Strait of Hormuz that connects the Gulf to the open ocean. Now those boats have farther-flying missiles, the militia claimed. The IRGCN now possesses ship-launched anti-ship missiles with a range as far as 430 miles, naval militia leader Adm. Ali Reza Tangsiri told Iranian state media. As recently as September 2020, the militia said its best anti-ship missile could travel just 180 miles, Defense News noted. The missile claim could have implications for tensions in the Gulf region. The IRGCN’s boats in mid-April 2020 sailed dangerously close to a group of U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard vessels practicing helicopter operations. Eleven Iranian fast attack craft “repeatedly conducted dangerous and harassing approaches of the USS Lewis B. Puller, USS Paul Hamilton, USS Firebolt, USS Sirocco, USCGC Wrangell and USCGC Maui while the U.S. vessels were conducting joint integration operations with U.S. Army AH-64E Apache attack helicopters in the international waters of the North Arabian Gulf,” the Navy stated. Puller is a sea-base ship with a large flight deck. Hamilton is a guided-missile destroyer. Firebolt and Sirocco are patrol boats. Wrangell and Maui are Coast Guard cutters. Puller’s battle group had been practicing deploying Apaches for strikes on small craft just like the type that harassed the group. “The IRGCN vessels repeatedly crossed the bows and sterns of the U.S. vessels at extremely close range and high speeds, including multiple crossings of the Puller with a 50 yard closest point of approach and within 10 yards of Maui‘s bow,” the Navy stated. On April 22, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he was authorizing the Navy to “shoot down and destroy” Iranian boats that harass American vessels. Trump however did not formally instruct the Navy to change its rules of engagement. The Navy periodically fires warning shots near Iranian boats but as a matter of policy does not attack the boats for the mere act of operating unprofessionally. It’s worth noting that U.S. forces also have operated in close, even dangerous, proximity to Iranian forces. “What he was emphasizing is all of our ships retain the right of self-defense, and people need to be very careful in their interactions to understand the inherent right of self-defense,” Deputy U.S. Defense Secretary David Norquist told NBC News. The back-and-forth claims and threats mark another month of escalating tensions between the United States and Iran. Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew the United States from the deal that limited Iran’s nuclear-weapons program. Iranian missileers in June 2019 shot down a U.S. Navy Global Hawk spy drone flying near the Strait of Hormuz. In January 2020 U.S. forces assassinated IRGC leader Gen. Qasem Soleimani in Iraq. Iran retaliated with barrages of rockets targeting American facilities in the region. Longer-range missiles could make the IRGCN more dangerous in wartime. It’s not clear whether or how the new munitions might alter the militia’s tactics during peacetime. David Axe is defense editor of The National Interest.

Topic: Fighter Jets Region: Middle East Blog Brand: The Buzz Tags: F-14 TomcatIranian Air ForceIran-Iraq WarGrummanIranian Revolution In the first six months of the war, the F-14’s superiority quickly became apparent; it reportedly racked up at least fifty air-to-air victories in the first six months of the war, with only one aircraft damaged in return. Throughout its history, the Grumman F-14 Tomcat has been operated by exactly two nations: the United States, which retired the aircraft in 2006 in favor of the Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet; and Iran, which continues to use them. Throughout the second half of the 1970s and the 1980s, other nations clamored for access to the new jet, but export restrictions prevented Washington from sharing it. Iran ultimately only received the jet in the early 1970s because of concerns that Iraq, which had received cutting-edge fighters from the Soviet Union, could outpace the Shah’s forces in the event of a war between the two. The Shah, who had eagerly aligned himself with the West at every turn, was a reliable enough ally that the U.S. government felt it could trust him with one of the best fighter aircraft in the world—or, to be more precise, eighty of them. In early 1979, as the Shah’s regime fell and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini installed a revolutionary theocracy in its place, Washington had second thoughts about this decision. But by then it was too late; the newly created Islamic Republic of Iran took control of seventy-nine of the eighty planes and began to operate them in 1980 when—sure enough—Saddam Hussein’s Iraq invaded Iran. In the first six months of the war, the F-14’s superiority quickly became apparent; it reportedly racked up at least fifty air-to-air victories in the first six months of the war, with only one aircraft damaged in return. Following this astonishing string of successes, Iraqi pilots changed tactics, by and large refusing to engage the F-14s, and Iranian pilots, knowing their value, likewise remained back from actual combat, using the planes’ advanced sensors to coordinate the movements of other, lesser aircraft. In spite of the restrictions placed on them, Iranian engineers also made several improvements to the Tomcat, including the addition of bomb racks to transform them from air superiority fighters to ground-attack ones. By the end of the war, the plane had made at least two hundred kills, losing only eight to enemy action. The second part was more due to the plane’s lack of availability as to its supposed invincibility; because of U.S. sanctions, spare parts for the aircraft were impossible to import, meaning that they were cannibalized from other aircraft; in 1988, the number of operational aircraft had dwindled to around thirty. Today, that number is estimated to have increased to forty, though even these vary in readiness. Trevor Filseth is a current and foreign affairs writer for the National Interest. Image: Flickr

News article:
Earlier this month, authorities at Mogadishu’s international airport seized six disassembled drones. Turkish pressure forced Somali authorities to release the Turkish engineers who accompanied the shipment. Those engineers said the drones were for agricultural purposes. This seems unlikely. First, the drones cost $780,000, far out of range of any Somali farmer. Second, the Turkish export licenses show the drones have a 3-4-hour flight endurance and payload capacity that suggests a military rather than agricultural role. Nor is it coincidental that Turkey has helped build a sprawling drone base manned by both Turkish and Somali intelligence operatives adjacent to Somalia’s National Intelligence and Security Agency, an organization that supports rather than stymies Somalia’s most radical terrorist groups. As Turkey’s assistance grows not only for Somali terrorist groups but also for Ethiopia’s genocidal regime and Sudanese Islamists, the Turkish drone base in Mogadishu poses a challenge to stability and security within the region. Inside Somalia, Ethiopia, and Sudan, those struggling for democracy and a more moderate, tolerant future increasingly find themselves both outgunned by their enemies and ignored by the West. The Somalia drone base is not alone. Earlier this year, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that Turkey had built a drone base on land seized during its 1974 invasion of Cyprus. "Turkey is not 780,000 square kilometers for us; Turkey is everywhere for us," he said. The base at Lefkoniko Airport, or Gecitkale Air Base, as Erdogan rebranded it, extends the operational range of Turkey’s drone fleet to threaten Israel, Egypt, and the Suez Canal, and shipping in the Eastern Mediterranean. Nor is Turkey the only problem. Iran has both used its drones to strike at Saudi Arabia and exported the means to manufacture them to Hezbollah, Asaib Ahl-e Al Haq, and the Houthis. These groups have effectively transformed pockets of Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen into Iranian drone bases. Pakistani drones now also threaten India. The White House should not shrug off attacks that fail to kill Americans: Drones will only grow more accurate and capable with time and trial. The United States should undertake a multipronged strategy in response. Congress should guarantee that U.S. allies threatened by Turkish, Iranian, or Pakistani drones have a qualitative military edge in both drones and counterdrone defense. Turkey bases drones in occupied northern Cyprus? Then the Pentagon should provide Cyprus or Greece drones that can strike deep into Turkey. The Turkish military provides drones to an increasingly unstable Somali government? Then it is time to provide drones to Kenya and Somaliland to counter the threat even if, in the latter case, it requires American specialists. Iran and Turkey provide Ethiopia with drones to use against its own people? Then, at a minimum, the U.S. should provide the Tigrayans with the ability to detect and shoot down those drones. The same need to provide defenses holds true for the Armenians, Emiratis, and Saudis. India, too, should be guaranteed a qualitative military edge in drones as Pakistan and perhaps even Turkey transfers drones to terrorists in Kashmir. Israel is a trickier issue, as it is not only a potential victim but also a proliferation problem: The Biden administration should bring financial and diplomatic pressure to bear to end Israel's drone sales to Ethiopia and Azerbaijan. For the U.S. to remain passive in the face of a growing threat, however, is an abrogation of both leadership and responsibility. Allying with America should be a path to security, not a liability.

News article:
The commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Navy says during confrontations in the Persian Gulf over the past 18 months, Iranian forces have "slapped" the Americans six times. Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri, speaking to a gathering of Basij students at the former US embassy compound in Tehran Saturday, was apparently referring to the period since the US assassination of Iran's legendary commander General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad. The Iranian youth, he said, should know “the importance of the Persian Gulf and the fact that our country is of great geographical significance". “This importance has led us to slap the Americans six times in one and a half years of confrontation, many of which have not been covered by the media yet,” Admiral Tangsiri said. Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri, commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Navy He cited the IRGC Navy's intervention last month to prevent US forces from stealing an Iranian oil cargo in the Sea of Oman in a dramatic operation which involved Iranian forces rappelling to the ship's deck, calling it the latest slap. “The tanker was carrying Iranian oil, but with the support of the Americans, it was refusing to deliver its cargo to our country; of course, this was the second ship we confiscated and the previous one was not reported,” the commander explained. “In order to stop it, the first group of our forces landed on the deck of the oil tanker in a heliborne operation and the second group entered the ship after traveling by vessels. However, as soon as the tanker headed to our waters, two American destroyers quickly approached from both sides to prevent its transfer to our waters,” he recounted. Six Iranian speed boats and two vessels were then dispatched to the scene, warning away a US helicopter which fired chaff as it fled, thinking it might be targeted by Iranian missiles, Admiral Tangsiri said. “Of course, we also had missiles as well as combat and reconnaissance drones in the area, but we only deployed our gunboats to confront the US destroyers because we wanted to humiliate them,” he added. The commander said the Americans refrain from entering Iran's territorial waters lest it could lead into a confrontation with IRGC naval forces. He touched on the history of direct confrontations between US and Iranian forces in the Persian Gulf, most importantly during the 1980-1988 Iraqi war under the former dictator Saddam Hussein on Iran. "In the eight years of the Sacred Defense, when Iraq became helpless in the face of Iran, the Americans entered into a direct conflict with Iran in the Persian Gulf in 1987 to support Saddam's army," Admiral Tangsiri said. "We in the IRGC Navy have sacrificed nine martyrs in direct battles with the Americans to defend the territory of our beloved country in the Persian Gulf. Of course, some of the confrontations have not been covered by the media for some reason," he said. "For the nine martyrs sacrificed in direct battles with the Americans, we were able to give them nine memorable slaps, and today they have realized the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic in the maritime domain."

Topic: US-Iran Relations Region: Middle East Blog Brand: The Reboot Tags: U.S.-Iran RelationsUnited StatesIranPersian GulfNavy SealsTanker War The supertanker Bridgeton—formerly the Kuwaiti tanker al-Rekkah—was the first ship to receive a U.S. escort. Here’s What You Need to Remember: The Tanker War demonstrated how Iran could retaliate against foreign pressure through calibrated, and semi-deniable attacks on the valuable shipping passing through the narrow waters of the Gulf—even though the campaign failed to inflict substantial economic damage, or indeed sink many large ships. A less violent variant of this strategy has evidently been implemented by Tehran today in its harrassment and sabotage of shipping in the Gulf On July 21, 1987, a gigantic 414,000-ton supertanker entered the Persian Gulf with an unusually prominent escort—a U.S. Navy missile cruiser and three frigates. The narrow straits of the Persian Gulf had become a shooting gallery due to the Iran-Iraq War, still raging seven years after Iraq’s surprise invasion of Iran in 1980. As Iran counterattacked into Iraqi territory, Baghdad—supplied and armed by the Soviet Union, France, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia—began blasting Iranian oil tankers with missiles, often with assistance from U.S. surveillance assets. Iran retaliated by targeting Kuwaiti tankers with imported Chinese Silkworm missiles. Though terrifying, both side’s anti-ship missiles inflicted relatively little damage as the tankers were simply too bulky to be easily sunk. The same was not true for the frigate USS Stark, struck accidentally by an Iraqi Exocet missile in May 1987 that killed thirty-seven crew. But Washington had an axe to grind with Tehran, not Baghdad—and decided to respond to pleas for military escort from Kuwait. This led to the controversial policy of reflagging Kuwaiti tankers so they could be escorted by U.S. warships in Operation Earnest Will. The supertanker Bridgeton—formerly the Kuwaiti tanker al-Rekkah—was the first ship to receive a U.S. escort. Upon entering the narrow Straits of Hormuz, a flight of four Iranian Phantom jets swooped towards the Bridgeton convoy, but turned away at the last minute. On July 23, Tehran rumbled that tanker was carrying “prohibited goods” but made no obvious moves U.S. intelligence had learned of Iranian plans to attack the convoy with motorboats operated by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy. Indeed, the head of the IRGC had lobbied for such an attack but was vetoed by Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini. He had a subtler approach in mind. As the Bridgeton cruised eighteen miles west of Iran’s Farsi Island on the morning of July 24, she abruptly struck what resembled a spiked-ball chained to the sea floor—a variant of an old Soviet M-08 mine built by North Korea and exported to Iran. An explosion ripped a large hole the tanker’s port cargo tank, flooding five of her thirty-one compartments but not injuring any crew. The night before, IRGCN motorboats had lain three chains totaling sixty mines spaced a half-kilometer part along the convoy’s well-known path. Ironically, the Bridgeton, limping along at just six knots, effectively escorted the U.S. warships back to port, because the huge tanker was the only vessel likely to survive hitting another mine. The “Bridgeton incident” was an inauspicious start for Earnest Will—highlighting the Navy’s failure to plan for mines. Iranian Mir-Hossein Prime Minister Mousavi gloated it had dealt "an irreparable blow on America's political and military prestige." Cunningly, the minelaying was both clearly Iranian in origin, while being technically deniable. However, the tactic inspired France and the UK, and later Italy and the Netherlands, to deploy their own warships to the Gulf, including seven minesweepers The U.S. Navy had few assets immediately at hand to deal with mines. Then, as today, mine warfare was a neglected branch. Weeks later, the Navy deployed the amphibious carrier USS Guadalcanal with RH-53D Sea Stallion minesweeping helicopters aboard. Eventually six ocean-going and five-riverine minesweepers joined Earnest Will, which at its peak involved as many as thirty U.S. Navy ships including carriers and the huge battleship Missouri. SEALs, Little Birds and Swift Boats As deploying U.S. mine-sweeping units ashore in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait proved politically prohibitive, Kuwait instead furnished two barges, Hercules and Wimbrown that the Pentagon promptly converted into mobile sea bases, complete with their own extensive self-defense weapons. The floating bases also hosted assets vital to a covert U.S. counter-offensive called Operation Prime Chance to catch the Iranians red-handed in the act. These included two Navy SEAL teams, six 64-foot-long Mark III “swift boats” and six tiny egg-shaped “Little Bird” helicopters from the Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation regiment. On September 21, a trio of Little Bird choppers flying off the frigate Jarrett were assigned to shadow the Iranian tank landing ship Iran Ajr, suspected to have been converted for minelaying. An MH-6 helicopter equipped with a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor and night-vision goggles led the way, escorted by two AH-6 gunships loaded with 7.62-millimeter miniguns and 2.75” rocket pods. Hovering stealthily 500 meters away, the helicopter crews recorded footage of the Iran Ajr’s crew deploying mines next to the Middle Shoals navigational buoy used by tankers. The Little Birds were ordered to open fire, and they raked the 614-ton vessel with their miniguns, causing the crew to take cover. However, Iranian sailors resumed deploying the mines a half-hour later. This time the night-vision-aided helicopter pilots unleashed a sustained barrage including rockets, killing three crew—and causing the remaining twenty-six to abandon ship. The following morning, Navy SEALs on Mark III boats rescued all but two of the Iranian sailors and boarded Iran Ajr. They found nine mines onboard and seized a logbook recording past minelaying activity, including maps showing the locations of those mines. Then the Navy towed Iran Ajr to deep water and blew her up. A trio of minigun-armed MH-6 helicopters tangled again with four Iranian ships approaching the sea base Hercules on October 8, including a corvette, a Swedish-built Boghammar and two Boston whaler type boats. The Boghammar’s crew fired Stinger missiles at the scout helicopters before being sunk by return fire. Eight Iranian crew were killed, and six more rescued from the water. When an Iranian missile struck the U.S.-flagged Sea Island City on October 16, injuring eighteen crew, Washington authorized a counterattack three days later called Operation Nimble Archer, resulting in the destruction of two Iranian oil platforms used to host IRGCN boats. But Iranian minelaying continued. On April 14, 1988, the crew of the frigate Samuel B. Roberts spotted three Iranian mines and realized she had unwittingly cruised into a minefield. While attempting to back out of danger, Roberts struck a mine which nearly split her in two and injured ten sailors. A heroic damage control effort saved the ship and her crew. Navy divers later identified additional mines in the area—with serial numbers identical to those on the Iran Ajr. Four days later, the U.S. launched a second retaliatory strike targeting two more Iranian oil platforms called Operation Praying Mantis. This time frigates and gunboats of the regular Iranian Navy counter attacked, resulting in the U.S. Navy’s largest foray since World War II, in which half of Iran’s surface combatants were sunk or crippled. This subdued Iranian naval operations thereafter. The Iran-Iraq war ended four months later—but sadly, not before one final tragic incident. On July 3, the U.S. Aegis missile cruiser Vincennes was skirmishing with Iranian fast boats, having unknowingly entered Iranian territorial waters, when her radar reported she was being approached by an Iranian F-14 Tomcat fighter. The cruiser fired two radar-guided SM-2 missiles at the contact—bringing down Iranian A300 airliner Flight 655, killing all 290 civilians aboard. Operation Earnest Will concluded September 26 when the USS Vandergrift escorted a final tanker into the Persian Gulf. The operatives involved in Prime Chance remained active, however, until June 1990. The Tanker War demonstrated how Iran could retaliate against foreign pressure through calibrated, and semi-deniable attacks on the valuable shipping passing through the narrow waters of the Gulf—even though the campaign failed to inflict substantial economic damage, or indeed sink many large ships. A less violent variant of this strategy has evidently been implemented by Tehran today in its harassment and sabotage of shipping in the Gulf. However, experience from the Tanker War suggested that even controlled, asymmetric harassment attacks may risk provoking a more destructive retaliation.

Topic: Drone Warfare Blog Brand: The Reboot Tags: Drone WarfareGreat Power CompetitionStrategic CompetitionPLARussian Military The transition from the war on terror to strategic competition is underway. Here's What You Need to Remember: The concept of drone swarms, for example, does not only make sense when it comes to blanketing an area with surveillance from multiple angles at once, but also with respect to survivability and success against sophisticated enemies. The U.S. Air Force Reaper Drones were crucial to victories in the War on Terrorism by delivering lethal, decisive and precise hellfire missile attacks upon terrorist and insurgent targets. They also provided countless hours of real-time intelligence to ground commanders through video surveillance in the Middle East and around the world. In fact, these drones have been continually expanding mission scope through a growing weapons arsenal and even new air-to-air attack capability. Yet, could the Reaper survive a war against China or Russia? Probably not. “We have effective RPAs that were designed for permissive environments where they do not have IADS (Integrated Air Defense Systems) or fighter jets coming after them. We will need a balance of the right size of a permissive RPA (Remotely Piloted Aircraft - drones) fleet as well as RPAs designed for contested environments and more high end threats like Russia and China,” Lt Gen Joseph T. Guastella, Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, U.S. Air Force, told The Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies in a video interview. Senior Air Force weapons developers certainly see a continued role for the Reaper, particularly regarding its more recent ability to drop a much greater sphere of weapons and fire an AIM-9X air-to-air missile. However, simply put, the drone may not be stealthy enough, small enough or fast enough to survive a war against any major opponent armed with advanced air defenses or sophisticated air-to-air weapons. “The Reaper fleet is healthy and robust and remains a critical part of our force. It is an effective platform for counterterrorism and deterrence. Its ISR and kinetic value offer incredibly valuable assets,” Guastella said. Guastella’s reference to the need for drones capable of flying in a so-called contested environment was discussed in the context of an incident last year wherein Iran shot down a U.S. Global Hawk drone. Such an occurrence certainly raises the question as to whether certain larger, less stealthy drones might prove too vulnerable for certain major power wars. “We have a rogue regime with Iran,” Guastella. So, given Guastella’s comment about the need for new drones, some might wonder just what kind of technical characteristics future drones need. Of course, much of this is already being worked on, which might explain why there continues to be a massive push toward engineering stealthier drones as well as smaller drones. The concept of drone swarms, for example, does not only make sense when it comes to blanketing an area with surveillance from multiple angles at once, but also with respect to survivability and success against sophisticated enemies. One reason is redundancy, as a deployment of many small drones in a swarm means the mission can continue in the event that several were shot down, jammed or disabled. Also, a smaller target is simply less visible to an enemy and therefore more difficult to hit. Small drones can also test enemy air defenses or move into extremely close-in, lower altitude, high-threat environments with less risk of destruction.

News article:
Iran appears to be preparing for a space launch as negotiations continue in Vienna over its tattered nuclear deal with world powers, according to an expert and satellite images. The likely blast off at Iran’s Imam Khomeini Spaceport comes as Iranian state media has offered a list of upcoming planned satellite launches in the works for the Islamic Republic’s civilian space program, which has been beset by a series of failed launches. Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard runs its own parallel program that successfully put a satellite into orbit last year. Iran’s foray into space comes at a precarious time for the Islamic Republic, with Israel and the United States considering secondary options in case talks fail, discussing possible military drills in order to practice destroying Iranian nuclear facilities in a potential worst-case scenario. Israel already believes that Iran is ratcheting up its forces into order to attack neighboring nations. Conducting a launch amid the Vienna talks fits the hardline posture struck by Tehran’s negotiators, who already described six previous rounds of diplomacy as a “draft,” exasperating Western nations. Germany’s new foreign minister has gone as far as to warn that “time is running out for us at this point.” But all this fits into a renewed focus on space by Iran’s hardline President Ebrahim Raisi, said Jeffrey Lewis, an expert at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies who studies Tehran’s program. With Iran’s former president Hassan Rouhani, who shepherded the nuclear deal, out of office, concerns about alienating the talks with launches that the US asserts aids Tehran’s ballistic missile program likely have faded. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “They’re not walking on eggshells,” Lewis said. “I think Raisi’s people have a new balance in mind.” Iranian state media did not acknowledge the activity at the spaceport and Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. The US military, which tracks space launches, did not respond to requests for comment. Satellite images taken Saturday by Planet Labs Inc. obtained by The Associated Press show activity at the spaceport in the desert plains of Iran’s rural Semnan province, some 240 kilometers (150 miles) southeast of Tehran. Advertisement A support vehicle stood parked alongside a massive white gantry that typically houses a rocket on the launch pad. That support vehicle has appeared in other satellite photos at the site just ahead of a launch. Also visible is a hydraulic crane with a railed platform, also seen before previous launches and likely used to service the rocket. Other satellite images in recent days at the spaceport has shown an increase in the number of cars at the facility, another sign of heightened activity that typically proceeds a launch. A building also believed to be the “checkout” facility for a rocket has seen increased activity as well, Lewis said. “This is fairly traditional pre-launch activity,” he told the AP. The activity comes after Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency on December 5 published an article saying its space program had four satellites ready for launch. It described one, the low-orbit imaging satellite Zafar 2, as being “under the final phase of preparation.” Zafar, which means “victory” in Farsi, weighs some 113 kilograms (250 pounds). The Zafar 1, however, failed to enter orbit after a February 2020 launch at the spaceport. That launch used a Simorgh, or “Phoenix,” rocket that carried the rocket into space, but failed to put it in orbit at the correct speed, according to Iranian officials at the time. Iran had spent just under 2 million euros ($2.3 million) to build the satellite. Iran’s civilian space program has seen a series of setbacks and fatal explosions plague it in recent years. One mysterious blast even caught the attention of then-US president Donald Trump in 2019, who tweeted out what appeared to be a classified US spy satellite picture of the explosion’s aftermath with the caption: “The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident.” Advertisement Meanwhile, the Guard in April 2020 revealed its own secret space program by successfully launching a satellite into orbit. The head of the US Space Command later dismissed the satellite as “a tumbling webcam in space” that would not provide Iran vital intelligence — though it showed Tehran’s ability to successfully get into orbit. Over the past decade, Iran has sent several short-lived satellites into orbit and in 2013 launched a monkey into space. But under Raisi, Iran’s Supreme Council of Space met for the first time in 11 years, according to a recent report by state-run television. Raisi said at the November meeting that it “shows the determination of this government to develop the space industry.” A high-ranking member of the Guard who runs its aerospace program, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, attended the meeting along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian. The US alleges such satellite launches defy a UN Security Council resolution calling on Iran to undertake no activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Iran, which long has said it does not seek nuclear weapons, maintains its satellite launches and rocket tests do not have a military component. Tehran also says it has not violated the UN resolution, as it only “called upon” Tehran not to conduct such tests. But the possible launch also comes as tensions again rise over Iran’s nuclear program. Since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear accord with world powers in 2018, Iran slowly abandoned all the limits the deal put on its program. Today, Tehran enriches uranium up to 60 percent purity — a short technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Its stockpile of enriched uranium also continues to grow and international inspectors face challenges in monitoring its advances. Lewis said he expects to see the space program accelerate given Raisi’s interest. “They’re not constrained by worries about the Iran deal in the same way that Rouhani was,” he said.

The Iranian Navy and the Royal Navy of Oman have held a joint military drill in Iran’s territorial waters in the Strait of Hormuz and the Sea of Oman. The military exercise, which was the ninth of its kind between the Iranian and Omani naval forces, was conducted early on Thursday in line with an agreement reached during sessions held by the two countries' joint military friendship commissions. The exercise, backed by helicopters from both countries and Iranian drones, was held in the presence of the heads of the joint military friendship commissions of the two countries and their members in the Strait of Hormuz and the Sea of Oman. The photo shows a joint drill between the Iranian Navy and the Royal Navy of Oman in Iran’s territorial waters in the Strait of Hormuz and the Sea of Oman on December 16, 2021. (By Fars news agency) The main goals of the naval drills, held with the participation of several floating units from both countries, have been declared as developing bilateral ties, implementation of various training programs at sea, exchanging experiences, and improving the efficiency of the two countries' naval staff. According to media reports, various scenarios were designed and implemented by the two sides' vessels and naval aircraft, which indicated a major leap forward in Thursday's drills compared to the previous ones. The drills came after the Iranian Navy chief expressed on Tuesday the country's readiness to host Oman’s naval fleets for a visit to Iranian ports as a means to further promote bilateral relations. Rear Admiral Shahram Irani praised the country’s stable relations with Oman, saying all attempts by enemies to harm friendly ties between the two Persian Gulf neighbors have been to no avail and that security and peace were the main demands of regional nations. Iran has also held joint naval exercises with other countries, including Pakistan and Russia. Iranian military experts and technicians have in recent years made great progress in developing and manufacturing a broad range of military equipment, making the armed forces self-sufficient in this regard. Iran has also held several military units with the aim of testing its combat preparedness in face of possible threats. Iranian officials have repeatedly underscored that the Islamic Republic will not hesitate to build up its defense capabilities, emphasizing such abilities are entirely meant for the purpose of defense and will be never subject to negotiations.

News article:
In yet another move against Iran, the US House Foreign Affairs Committee has passed a bill to restrict the proliferation of Iran’s military drones. This is while negotiations over the removal of anti-Iran sanctions are in progress in the Austrian capital Vienna. Tehran has time and again proven that its military prowess is purely defensive. So, how can Washington’s move be justified when the US sells bombs and drones to other countries that use them in unjust wars to kill civilians? A bipartisan group of leading members of the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs have just passed a bill aimed at restricting Iran's defensive military prowess. The Stop Iranian Drones Act bans the supply, sale, or transfer, of military drones to or from Iran under US law. The bill addresses, what the US claims to be, the growing threat of Iran’s unmanned aerial vehicle programme. However, despite attaining self sufficiency in the arms industry, making great progress in developing and manufacturing a broad range of military equipment in recent years, Iran has time and again proven that its military capabilities are purely defensive in the face of moves by the US and its regional allies, who have been fomenting chaos and tension in the region. Last month the Iranian army intercepted two US unmanned aerial vehicles, which had penetrated Iranian airspace in an area where Iran was holding massive drills. They were sent on their way with a stern warning to stay away from the zone. The ban imposed on the Iranian military drones comes amid ongoing talks over the removal of anti Iran Sanctions between Tehran and the signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal in Vienna. The US has long been trying to tie Iran's military capabilities to the talks, however, the Islamic Republic has repeatedly underscored that its defensive capabilities will never be subject to negotiations. The US also baselessly accuses Iran of conducting drone attacks in West Asia, while Washington has well documented blood on its hands, having killed thousands upon thousands of innocent civilians by conducting their own hypocritical drone and air strikes in the region. It is should be noted that the United States is the leading exporter of arms in the world and that Washington attempts to restrict Iran's defensive capabilities while at the same time it sells bombs, drones and arms to countries like Saudi Arabia that use them in unjust wars, such as the war in Yemen, to kill innocent civilians. In fact, half of all US arms transfers between 2016 and 2020 went to the West Asia region, particularly Saudi Arabia, leading to more instability and chaos. The US is also guilty of civilian killings in many war theatres, like in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, from drone strikes to other military action rights groups have accused Washington of hiding the real number of civilian casualties and the media do a poor job of reporting “collateral damage”. Based on the US military's own assertion, Washington has conducted almost one hundred thousand drone and air strikes in the West Asia region in the past twenty years. According to analysis published by the civilian harm monitoring group, Air Wars, the US strikes have killed at least 22,000 civilians across various theatres, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Libya, Yemen and Pakistan since 2001. The group says the number of casualties and fatalities could in all likelihood be as high as 48,000. The US assassinated one of Iran's top generals, Qassem Soleimani, together with Iraqi PMU Commander Abu Mahdi Al Muhandas, in a drone strike near Baghdad International Airport on January 3rd 2020. The two were iconic figures in the fight against the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group that emerged amid the mayhem resulting from the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. High ranking US diplomats have previously admitted that Washington is responsible for the foundation of the Daesh terrorist group. Just days after the dastardly assassination the IRGC launched a volley of missiles at a major military base housing American forces in Iraq. Iran denounced the assassination as an act of state terrorism and vowed to bring about the end of the American presence in the region as the ultimate act of revenge.

In yet another move against Iran, the US House Foreign Affairs Committee has passed a bill to restrict the proliferation of Iran’s military drones. This is while negotiations over the removal of anti-Iran sanctions are in progress in the Austrian capital Vienna. Tehran has time and again proven that its military prowess is purely defensive. So, how can Washington’s move be justified when the US sells bombs and drones to other countries that use them in unjust wars to kill civilians? A bipartisan group of leading members of the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs have just passed a bill aimed at restricting Iran's defensive military prowess. The Stop Iranian Drones Act bans the supply, sale, or transfer, of military drones to or from Iran under US law. The bill addresses, what the US claims to be, the growing threat of Iran’s unmanned aerial vehicle programme. However, despite attaining self sufficiency in the arms industry, making great progress in developing and manufacturing a broad range of military equipment in recent years, Iran has time and again proven that its military capabilities are purely defensive in the face of moves by the US and its regional allies, who have been fomenting chaos and tension in the region. Last month the Iranian army intercepted two US unmanned aerial vehicles, which had penetrated Iranian airspace in an area where Iran was holding massive drills. They were sent on their way with a stern warning to stay away from the zone. The ban imposed on the Iranian military drones comes amid ongoing talks over the removal of anti Iran Sanctions between Tehran and the signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal in Vienna. The US has long been trying to tie Iran's military capabilities to the talks, however, the Islamic Republic has repeatedly underscored that its defensive capabilities will never be subject to negotiations. The US also baselessly accuses Iran of conducting drone attacks in West Asia, while Washington has well documented blood on its hands, having killed thousands upon thousands of innocent civilians by conducting their own hypocritical drone and air strikes in the region. It is should be noted that the United States is the leading exporter of arms in the world and that Washington attempts to restrict Iran's defensive capabilities while at the same time it sells bombs, drones and arms to countries like Saudi Arabia that use them in unjust wars, such as the war in Yemen, to kill innocent civilians. In fact, half of all US arms transfers between 2016 and 2020 went to the West Asia region, particularly Saudi Arabia, leading to more instability and chaos.

News article:
Iran held an unannounced air defense drill at a nuclear facility for the second time this month on Monday, as a senior military commander warned of a "crushing" response against any Israeli attack. The semi-official Fars news agency reported that sounds of anti-aircraft fire heard on Monday from around the Bushehr nuclear power plant were caused by an air defense exercise. "This exercise took place at 5 A.M. local time (1:30 GMT) with full preparation and coordination with the armed forces," a local official, Mohammadtaqi Irani, told Fars. Gholamali Rashid, one of Iran's top military commanders, was quoted by Iranian news agency nournews as saying during the military exercise: "If Israel carries out attacks against Iran, our armed forces will immediately attack all centers, bases, routes, and spaces used to carry out the aggression." In early December, Iranian air defenses fired a missile as part of an exercise over the central town of Natanz, which also houses nuclear installations. Indirect talks between Iran and the United States have resumed in a bid to revive Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers, which the United States abandoned three years ago, reimposing harsh sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Iran's arch-foe, Israel, has warned it will adopt other measures should diplomacy fail to curb Iran's fast-advancing nuclear program.

Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard staged a major military exercise across the country's south on Monday amid heightened tensions with Israel and world powers over Tehran's nuclear program, state TV reported. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The Guard's aerospace division, ground troops and naval forces joined in the five-day drill, the report said, with maritime forces set to maneuver in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, the narrow gateway for 20% of the world's traded oil. 3 View gallery Archive: Iran's Revolutionary Guard launches ballistic missile during military drill, July 29, 2020 ( Photo: AFP ) The exercise comes days after talks to revive Tehran's tattered nuclear deal with world powers broke up in Vienna. Iran has accelerated its nuclear advances as negotiations to return to the accord struggle to make headway. When asked by a reporter during a press briefing whether Iran would consider enriching uranium to weapons-grade 90% purity, the foreign ministry spokesman gave a vague response. "The level, amount and quality of enrichment are in line with the needs of Iran's peaceful nuclear program," Saeed Khatibzadeh said. "All these measures have been taken with the knowledge of the International Atomic Energy Agency and will continue to be so in the future." His comment came after Iran's hard-line Kayhan newspaper published an editorial arguing that Iran should enrich uranium up to 90% purity and become a "world nuclear power" if negotiations in Vienna fail to grant the country sanctions relief. 3 View gallery Members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) march during the annual military parade marking the anniversary of the outbreak of the devastating 1980-1988 war with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, in the capital Tehran ( Photo: AFP ) Since former president Donald Trump pulled America out of the nuclear deal and reimposed crushing sanctions, Tehran has started enriching uranium up to 60% purity — a short technical step from the 90% needed to make an atomic bomb. Iran insists that its nuclear program is peaceful. But the country's steps away from its obligations under the 2015 accord have alarmed its archenemy Israel and other world powers. Israel has repeatedly threatened unilateral action against Iran's nuclear program. On Monday, Gen. Gholamali Rashid, a top Guard commander, vowed a harsh response to any Israeli military action against Iran. Iranian forces will launch "a crushing attack on all bases, centers, paths and space used to carry out the aggression without delay," the semi-official Mehr news agency quoted him as saying. 3 View gallery Commanders of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard walk past missiles during a visit to a new military base in an undisclosed location in the Persian Gulf ( Photo: AP ) "Any threat to Iran's nuclear and military bases by the Zionist regime is not possible without the green light support of the United States," he said. Earlier on Monday, residents in Bushehr, some 700 kilometers (440 miles) south of Iran's capital, Tehran, reported seeing a light in the sky and hearing a loud explosion near the Bushehr nuclear power plant.

Precision-strike combat drones as well as sophisticated ballistic and cruise missiles have played a major role in the large-scale military exercises that Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) is holding in an area stretching along the southern shores of the country. On Tuesday and the second day of the Great Prophet 17 joint drills, the IRGC aerospace forces flew unmanned aerial vehicles, and the aircraft struck a series of fixed and mobile targets on the ground and in the sea using bombs with pinpoint accuracy. Attack helicopters provided close air support (CAS) and fired accurately at the designated targets. Troops practiced coastal defense exercises and anti-heliborne tactics as well. Additionally, IRGC forces launched volleys of various surface-to-surface, anti-ship missiles, and coast-to-sea ballistic missiles against vessels, facilities, and bases of the hypothetical enemy and destroyed them as planned. IRGC naval units also utilized domestically-developed offshore and onshore air defense systems against hostile drones. Forces from Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) are seen on the second day of the large-scale Great Prophet 17 joint drills in southern Iran on December 21, 2021. (Photo by Tasnim news agency) Moreover, the participating divisions fired advanced anti-ship cruise missiles simultaneously from the coast and Zolfaqar-class fast attack craft and struck the enemy’s vessels. In another operation, two Sukhoi Su-17 fighter bombers hit designated targets on the ground. The Great Prophet 17 drills kicked off on Monday, covering the coastlines of the southern Iranian provinces of Hormozgan, Bushehr, and Khuzestan. The IRGC Deputy Chief of Operations and spokesman for the joint drills Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan said the military exercises involve various IRGC units, such as the aerospace force and the cyber-electronic division. He noted that the participating units will carry out offensive operations so as to destroy the hypothetical enemy’s sources of attacks. Iran’s Armed Forces hold routine military exercises throughout the year. Iranian military experts and technicians have in recent years made great progress in developing and manufacturing a broad range of domestically-manufactured equipment, making the armed forces self-sufficient in this regard. Iranian officials have repeatedly underscored that the Islamic Republic will not hesitate to build up its defense capabilities, emphasizing such abilities are entirely meant for the purpose of defense and will be never subject to negotiations.

Iranian media says all 16 missiles hit their intended targets with 100 percent accuracy.The final day of the drills also saw the simultaneous deployment of 10 drones, with footage showing Mohajer-6 UAVs taking on two naval targets using Ghaem-5 guided bombs.The Great Prophet 17 drills kicked off across the southern Iranian provinces of Bushehr, Hormozgan and Khuzestan on 20 December, with portions of the waters in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz also cordoned off for the exercises. The drills included mobile firing of anti-ship missiles by fleets of fast-moving missile boats, and the first time cruise missiles were fired from the Shahid Roudaki, a 150-metre multi-purpose oceangoing warship built out of a converted cargo vessel.The exercises also saw Revolutionary Guard cyber units suppressing mock enemy air defences using electronic warfare tools to poke holes in enemy missile defences.Response to ‘Empty Threats’Iranian Armed Forces chief of staff Mohammad Bagheri stated Friday that the Great Prophet 17 drills were carried out when they were for a specific reason: threats coming from Israel.“This exercise was planned in advance, but the numerous empty threats of the Zionist regime’s officials in recent days caused this exercise to take place at this time,” Bagheri said. The commander warned that “if the officials of this regime do a damn thing [against Iran], we will cut off their hands”.Bagheri did not elaborate on what “threats” from Israel he was referring to. However, earlier this week, incoming Israeli Air Force commander, Tomer Bar, warned that Tel Aviv could attack the Islamic Republic’s nuclear facilities as soon as “tomorrow” if ordered to do so. The 52-year-old says that he expects an Israeli attack on Iran to happen within his lifetime.Earlier this year, Israel set aside $1.5 billion in its defence budget to prepare for possible strikes on Iran, either independently or in coordination with Washington. That amount accounts for less than half of the $3.8 billion in military aid sent to Israel by the United States in 2021.On Monday, Gholam Ali Rashid, the chief of the Iranian Armed Forces Central Command HQ, suggested that Israel wouldn’t dare try to strike Iran without first receiving a “green light” from the US. The commander warned that any strike would spark a “crushing attack [by Iran] on all bases, centres, paths, and space used to carry out the aggression without delay.”Israeli officials have spent decades accusing Iran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons, with pressure by Mossad and former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu proving instrumental in lobbying the Trump administration into pulling out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal in 2018. Israel subscribes to the so-called ‘Begin Doctrine’, named after former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, under which it gives itself the unilateral authority to target any country in the Middle East it suspects may be building nuclear weapons. Tel Aviv has already implemented the doctrine twice, first against Iraq in 1981, and then against Syria in 2007.Iran denies that it is pursuing nuclear weaponry or weapons of mass destruction of any kind, saying its nuclear programme is restricted to peaceful purposes. The Islamic Republic has repeatedly criticised the international community over its alleged double standard in the way it treats Tehran nuclear programme compared with that of Israel, which is widely suspected already to possess dozens or even hundreds of nuclear weapons, and the capability to deliver them using ground-based missiles, aircraft and submarines. Tel Aviv has neither confirmed nor denied its status as a nuclear weapons power. https://sputniknews.com/20211222/israel-could-attack-irans-nuclear-programme-tomorrow-if-needed-says-air-force-future-head-1091726758.html https://sputniknews.com/20211210/f-him-bitter-trump-bashes-netanyahu-over-bibis-efforts-to-cozy-up-to-biden-1091415003.html iran Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60 2021 Ilya Tsukanov Ilya Tsukanov News en_EN Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60 1920 1080 true 1920 1440 true 1920 1920 true Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60 Ilya Tsukanov iran, missile, drills, israel

Iranian media says all 16 missiles hit their intended targets with 100 percent accuracy.The final day of the drills also saw the simultaneous deployment of 10 drones, with footage showing Mohajer-6 UAVs taking on two naval targets using Ghaem-5 guided bombs.The Great Prophet 17 drills kicked off across the southern Iranian provinces of Bushehr, Hormozgan and Khuzestan on 20 December, with portions of the waters in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz also cordoned off for the exercises. The drills included mobile firing of anti-ship missiles by fleets of fast-moving missile boats, and the first time cruise missiles were fired from the Shahid Roudaki, a 150-metre multi-purpose oceangoing warship built out of a converted cargo vessel.The exercises also saw Revolutionary Guard cyber units suppressing mock enemy air defences using electronic warfare tools to poke holes in enemy missile defences.Response to ‘Empty Threats’Iranian Armed Forces chief of staff Mohammad Bagheri stated Friday that the Great Prophet 17 drills were carried out when they were for a specific reason: threats coming from Israel.“This exercise was planned in advance, but the numerous empty threats of the Zionist regime’s officials in recent days caused this exercise to take place at this time,” Bagheri said. The commander warned that “if the officials of this regime do a damn thing [against Iran], we will cut off their hands”.Bagheri did not elaborate on what “threats” from Israel he was referring to. However, earlier this week, incoming Israeli Air Force commander, Tomer Bar, warned that Tel Aviv could attack the Islamic Republic’s nuclear facilities as soon as “tomorrow” if ordered to do so. The 52-year-old says that he expects an Israeli attack on Iran to happen within his lifetime.Earlier this year, Israel set aside $1.5 billion in its defence budget to prepare for possible strikes on Iran, either independently or in coordination with Washington. That amount accounts for less than half of the $3.8 billion in military aid sent to Israel by the United States in 2021.On Monday, Gholam Ali Rashid, the chief of the Iranian Armed Forces Central Command HQ, suggested that Israel wouldn’t dare try to strike Iran without first receiving a “green light” from the US. The commander warned that any strike would spark a “crushing attack [by Iran] on all bases, centres, paths, and space used to carry out the aggression without delay.”Israeli officials have spent decades accusing Iran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons, with pressure by Mossad and former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu proving instrumental in lobbying the Trump administration into pulling out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal in 2018. Israel subscribes to the so-called ‘Begin Doctrine’, named after former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, under which it gives itself the unilateral authority to target any country in the Middle East it suspects may be building nuclear weapons. Tel Aviv has already implemented the doctrine twice, first against Iraq in 1981, and then against Syria in 2007.Iran denies that it is pursuing nuclear weaponry or weapons of mass destruction of any kind, saying its nuclear programme is restricted to peaceful purposes. The Islamic Republic has repeatedly criticised the international community over its alleged double standard in the way it treats Tehran nuclear programme compared with that of Israel, which is widely suspected already to possess dozens or even hundreds of nuclear weapons, and the capability to deliver them using ground-based missiles, aircraft and submarines.

An Iranian military chief said that the military exercises were a response to "massive but pointless threats" from Israel. The British government sharply condemned the missile launches. Military drills conducted this week by Iran were intended to send a warning to Israel, the country's top military commanders said on Friday. Iran conducted these drills in the Persian Gulf amid concerns over possible plans by Israel to attack Iranian nuclear sites. The war games included firing ballistic and cruise missiles. State television showed missiles flattening a target which resembled Israel's Dimona nuclear reactor. Why did Iran conduct the military drills? Iranian Revolutionary Guards chief General Hossein Salami said this week's drills were intended to send "a very clear message" and a "serious warning" to regional rival Israel. "We will cut off their hands if they make a wrong move," Salami said on state TV. Armed Forces Chief of Staff Major General Mohammed Bagheri said 16 ballistic missiles of different classes had been fired. Bagheri said that the drill was an answer to Israel's recent "massive but pointless threats" to Iran. Iran's missile launches were sharply criticized by the UK Image: IRGC/WANA/REUTERS Iran has previously said that it's short and medium-range missiles can reach Israel, as well as US bases in the region. What were the reactions to the drills? The United Kingdom condemned the launch of ballistic missiles during the war games, saying that the launches were in "breach" of a UN Security Council resolution. "These actions are a threat to regional and international security, and we call on Iran to immediately cease its activities," the British Foreign Office said in a statement. Saeed Khatibzadeh, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, responded to the statement, accusing the United Kingdom of "meddling in Iran's defensive capacity." Israel opposes efforts by other countries to revive Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal, claiming that Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons. Iran says it only wants to develop a civil nuclear program. Israel is widely believed to be the only Middle Eastern country with a nuclear arsenal. sdi/rs (AFP, AP, Reuters)

Topic: Ballistic Missiles Region: Middle East Blog Brand: The Reboot Tags: IranWar With IranAircraft CarrierU.S. NavyAnti-Ship Missile The succession of Fateh strikes in the last nineteen months signal a new willingness by Tehran to use its ballistic missiles—both those on home soil and deployed to Syria—to pressure adversaries across the Middle East. Here's What You Need To Remember: The domestically-developed Fateh-110 is not Iran’s longest-range missile, but it has nonetheless spearheaded a succession of missile strikes targeting Tehran’s foes since 2017. On the morning of January 20, 2019, a six-by-six Mercedes-Benz truck in al-Kiswah, Syria crewed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps began elevating a missile mounted on its back into firing position. Once the nearly nine-meter long missile attained a roughly seventy-degree angle, it solid-fuel rocket blasted it on an arcing trajectory towards Mount Hermon, twenty-miles to the west on the Israeli-controlled portion of the Golan Height. Skiers vacationing at the ski-resort there could see the contrails of the Fateh-110 (“Conqueror”) missile streaking towards them at three times the speed of sound (video here.) However, the missile was also detected by Israeli radars. As Israel’s David’s Sling anti-ballistic missile system was not yet operational, the IDF made do with the Iron Dome, a system designed for swatting slower, unguided artillery shells and rockets. Two Tamir interceptor missiles rocketed over snowboarderstowards the Fateh missile at Mach 2, switched to electro-optical sensors for terminal guidance and destroyed it. Israeli website Debka claims the attack was ordered by the head of the Iranian Quds force, General Qassam Suleimani, as a means to test Israeli defenses. Later that day, the IDF retaliated with an intense series of strikes in Syria detailed in this earlier article. The domestically-developed Fateh-110 is not Iran’s longest-range missile, but it has nonetheless spearheaded a succession of missile strikes targeting Tehran’s foes since 2017. During the Iran-Iraq War, Iran relied upon Soviet Scud-B missile purchased from Libya (20), North Korea (120, plus 150 more post-war) and Syria (12) to retaliate against Iraq’s larger ballistic missile force. Afterwards, North Korea assisted Iran in setting up production of a domestic Scud-variant called the Shahib-1. However, the Shahib and its successors are liquid-fuel rockets which required days to gas up, limiting their reactivity and leaving them vulnerable to preemptive strikes. Starting in 1995, Iranian engineers began developing the first Fateh missile by adapting an unguided Zelzal-2 610-millimeter long-range artillery rocket, itself a reverse-engineered Soviet Luna-M “FROG” rocket. Chinese experts assisted with installing an inertial guidance system and maneuvering fins to allow the rocket to make course corrections. The initial Fateh missile tested in 2001 had a range of only 130 miles. In the following decade, Iran built and tested three additional generations of improved Fateh-110A, Fateh-110B (or Mod 3) and 110D1 models, eventually boosting range to 180 miles and improving accuracy using GPS-guidance. The Fateh’s payload ranges in size from a 990 to 1,433-pound warhead. Its accuracy remains debated, with claims that a Fateh will land on average within either 100 or 250 meters of its designated target. A 2017 report assessed a total of one hundred Iranian Fateh launchers in service with the IRGC Aerospace Force. Like the Scud tactical missiles which Iraq used to bombard Israel and Saudi Arabi during the 1991 Gulf War, the truck-mounted Fateh can be moved and fired on short notice, making it survivable versus preemptive attacks. However, the missile’s limited range meant that the Fateh could only be used against countries bordering Iran. However, Tehran has also sold the Fateh-110A design for domestic manufacture in Syria under the name M-600 Tisheree. Syria began using M-600s to attack anti-Assad rebels starting in 2012. Since 2007, Damascus and Iran have also transferred Fateh-110s and M-600s to Hezbollah, leading Israel to repeatedly bomb missile transfers because it views solid-fuel ballistic missiles as potential game-changers. Iran’s Carrier-Killing Missiles? The Fateh has spawned a bewildering variety of successors. In 2015 Tehran unveiled the lighter steel/titanium composite Fateh-313 with 310 mile range. Then in August 2018 it announced the Fateh-Mobin (“Bright Conqueror”), which has an infrared-seeker for terminal guidance, and claimed radar-evasive features—though such features were not discernible in the image shown to the public. In 2011, Iran also unveiled an anti-ship version of the Fateh-110 called the Khalij Fars (“Persian Gulf”), ostensibly equipped an electro-optical seeker to allow it hit to home in on a moving naval target, though photographic evidence isunclear on that. An Iranian article claims that in a 2013 test, the missile struck a moving naval target with eight-meters of accuracy (recording here). Anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBM) are rare and difficult to defend against. China’s development of DF-21D and DF-26 ASBMs has raised concerns about the survivability of aircraft carriers. The Khalij Fars, however, has one-quarter the DF-21’s range at 190 to 220 miles, and relatedly a lower maximum speed of Mach 3 compared to the DF-21’s Mach 10, making it easier to intercept. Like the Chinese missiles, the Khalij Fars would also require external reconnaissance assets to provide initial target-cueing for its inertial guidance system. However, the Khalij Far’s limitations are significantly mitigated by the fact that the Persian Gulf is quite confined, with only between 25 to 250 miles separating the western and eastern shores. Iran also claims to have developed a Mach 4 anti-radiation variant called the Hormuz-1 and Hormuz-2 which are designed to home-in on land- and sea-based radars respectively. If real, these would be the world’s first anti-radiation ballistic missiles. Revenge-by-Missile In 2016, Iran also showed off a modernized “Zolfaghar” variant of the Fateh capable of carrying thirty thirty-seven-pound submunitions, and with a purported range of 434 miles—enough to strike Riyadh from Iranian soil. Later photos suggested the Zolfaghar was made of up filament-wound fiber to reduce weight, thereby increasing range. Skepticism of the Zolfaghar’s reach was largely quashed on June 18–19, 2017 when in retaliation for a terrorist attack on the Iranian parliament that killed eighteen, the IRGC fired six Zolfaghars targeting ISIS-held Mayadin, Syria. The missiles were launched 370 miles away in Kermanshah, Iran—the first missile strike launched from Iranian territory since 2001. Despite Tehran’s claims that all six missiles landed on target, however, the strike’s accuracy was questionable. An assessment by Jane’s suggests only one or two missiles landed in Mayadeen—hitting an open field, causing no casualties. The IDF reported that three missiles landed in Iraq (the border is over forty miles away.) An Iranian general later claimed the Iraqi explosions were casings jettisoned by the missiles prior to impact. Then on September 8, 2018, two months after the IRGC lost ten soldiers in a border skirmish with Kurdish separatists, Iran launched seven Fateh-110B missiles on another cross-border strike targeting the headquarters of the Kurdistan Democratic Party-Iran, located in Koya, Iraq. This far deadlier attack killed eighteen Kurds and injured at least fifty. Footage of the strike released by Iranian media depicts two missiles striking a compound, suggesting greater precision. Finally, on October 1, 2018—a week after gunmen massacred twenty-five in an Iranian military parade—the IRGC launched a third cross-border salvo: six Fateh-110 and medium-range Qiam missiles targeting the ISIS-held town of al-Bukamal, Syria. However, two of the Qiam missiles may have crashed during launch (the IRGC claims otherwise). Iran claims the strike killed twenty-five ISIS fighters, but locals and the U.S. military reported the strike inflicted no damage. The succession of Fateh strikes in the last nineteen months signal a new willingness by Tehran to use its ballistic missiles—both those on home soil and deployed to Syria—to pressure adversaries across the Middle East.

Finally, on October 1, 2018—a week after gunmen massacred twenty-five in an Iranian military parade—the IRGC launched a third cross-border salvo: six Fateh-110 and medium-range Qiam missiles targeting the ISIS-held town of al-Bukamal, Syria. However, two of the Qiam missiles may have crashed during launch (the IRGC claims otherwise). Iran claims the strike killed twenty-five ISIS fighters, but locals and the U.S. military reported the strike inflicted no damage. The succession of Fateh strikes in the last nineteen months signal a new willingness by Tehran to use its ballistic missiles—both those on home soil and deployed to Syria—to pressure adversaries across the Middle East.

Topic: Iran Region: Middle East Blog Brand: Middle East Watch Tags: IranMissilesIsraelJCPOANuclear Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, the leader of the IRGC, claimed that the exercise was intended as “a serious warning to Zionist regime officials.” Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) military branch indicated that it had fired sixteen surface-to-surface ballistic missiles during a five-day military drill in a warning to Israel, according to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency. Iranian officials indicated that the missiles fell into five categories, with ranges between 350 and 2,000 kilometers, or between 200 and 1,250 miles. The missile launches were broadcast on Iranian state television, although it was not immediately clear how many of them hit their targets. IRGC military leaders indicated that the exercises were intended mainly as a warning to Israel. “These exercises were designed to respond to threats made in recent days by the Zionist regime,” Iran’s armed forces chief of staff Major General Mohammad Bagheri said to IRNA. Bagheri claimed that the missiles had “annihilated the chosen target,” and indicated that hundreds of other ballistic missiles had been prepared for use during the exercises. Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, the leader of the IRGC, claimed that the exercise was intended as “a serious warning to Zionist regime officials.” This was a reference to the Israeli government led by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. “Make the slightest mistake, we will cut off their hand,” Salami said. The military drill took place across Iran’s south and southwestern provinces. It was dubbed “Payambar-e-Azam,” or “Great Prophet.” It is being held at the same time that Iranian diplomats are pursuing nuclear discussions in Vienna, Austria, seeking to restore the 2015 “JCPOA” nuclear agreement. Israel, which had previously indicated its dissatisfaction with the JCPOA, has made clear in recent months that it does not feel bound by diplomacy with Iran and will continue to pursue other means of constraining the Iranian nuclear program, no matter the outcome of the Vienna negotiations. Earlier in 2021, Israeli agents assassinated Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. They were alleged to be behind several other high-profile explosions at Iranian nuclear facilities too. The United States has also indicated that it may pursue sabotage or other unspecified options if negotiations fail. While Iranian negotiators in Vienna have insisted that all sanctions from the Trump administration be dropped as a precondition to an agreement, the Biden administration has rejected this demand, noting that some of the sanctions were imposed on Iran’s ballistic missile program, which also violates a UN Security Council resolution. This impasse has led to limited progress in the ongoing negotiations, which are scheduled to resume on Monday, December 27.

News article:
The U.S. is concerned about Iran’s development of space launch vehicles, saying there is a serious risk Tehran is building up its ballistic missile program and one could someday be used to carry a nuclear warhead, a State Department spokesperson told The Hill. The Iranian government on Thursday claimed to have successfully launched a rocket carrying three satellite “research devices” into space. It was not immediately clear if the research devices had been successfully launched into orbit, but the move follows increasingly provocative actions by Iran even as it engages in indirect talks with the U.S. over a mutual return to the 2015 nuclear deal, called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The State Department spokesperson said Iran’s space program, which Tehran describes as for civilian purposes, violates a resolution in the United Nations Security Council that calls upon Iran not to undertake activity related to ballistic missiles “designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.” “The United States continues to use all its nonproliferation tools to prevent the further advancement of Iran’s missile programs and urges other countries to take steps to address Iran’s missile development activity,” the spokesperson said. Iran’s semiofficial Fars News Agency on Thursday quoted Iranian Defense Ministry Spokesman Ahmad Hosseini lauding the rocket’s successful launch into space as an achievement of the Islamic republic’s civilian space program. “We will speed up work so that we can become one of the six countries that can launch satellites into the GEO (geostationary) orbit,” Hosseini is quoted as saying. Fars News Agency is owned by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. in 2019. The Associated Press reported that Hosseini and other officials had yet to comment on the status of the objects launched into space hours after the launch, suggesting the rocket had failed to reach the speeds necessary to place its payload in the correct orbit. The Trump administration viewed Iran’s efforts to launch satellites into space as provocative military actions. In 2020, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned Iran’s successful launch of a military satellite into space, saying the effort advanced Tehran’s ballistic missile program. A launchpad rocket explosion in 2019 notably grabbed the attention of then-President Trump, who tweeted out an image of the destruction along with “best wishes and good luck” in determining the cause of the failure. And in 2017, the U.S., United Kingdom, France and Germany issued a joint complaint to the United Nations over Iran’s launching of a satellite-carrying rocket, with then-U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Niki Haley calling the launch a violation of the nuclear deal. The Trump administration pulled out of the JCPOA in 2018, and the Biden administration is engaging in an eighth round of indirect talks with Iran in Vienna over efforts to bring both parties back to the deal, which President Biden says is the best way to prevent Iran from achieving a nuclear weapon. Iran, which claims its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes, began violating the terms of the agreement in 2019 and has since far exceeded the constraints of the deal, drawing the frustration of American negotiators who criticize Tehran as not engaging in the talks in good faith. State Department spokesperson Ned Price on Wednesday told reporters that while the U.S. and Iran have made “some modest progress” during the last round of talks, it is too soon to say how substantive that progress is. “At a minimum, any progress, we believe, is falling short of Iran accelerating [its] nuclear steps, and is far too slow,” he said. “As we’ve said before, this can’t continue or it will soon be too late to return to mutual compliance with the JCPOA.”

News article:
The United States voiced concern on December 30 over Iran's new space launch, saying such activities use technology that can help further its ballistic-missile program. "The United States remains concerned with Iran's development of space launch vehicles, which pose a significant proliferation concern," a State Department spokesperson said after Iran announced it had launched a rocket carrying three satellites. The space launch vehicles "incorporate technologies that are virtually identical to, and interchangeable with, those used in ballistic missiles, including longer-range systems," the spokesperson said. The spokesperson also said the launch violated UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which backed the 2015 nuclear deal and called on Iran not to carry out work on ballistic missiles with the potential to carry nuclear warheads. Earlier on December 30, Defense Ministry spokesman Ahmad Hosseini said the rocket used was an Iranian Simorgh (Phoenix) rocket and that the payload reached an altitude of 470 kilometers. It was unclear whether any objects had successfully entered Earth’s orbit. Iran’s Tasnim news agency quoted Hosseini as saying the launch was a “space research mission.” He said the "performance of the space center and the performance of the satellite carrier were satisfactory." State television showed footage of the rocket launching from the Imam Khomeini Spaceport near the northern city of Semnan. The reported launch comes amid difficult negotiations in Vienna between Tehran and world powers over reviving the nuclear deal aimed at restricting Iran's nuclear program. That deal has been under threat since the United States withdrew from it and reimposed sanctions against Iran in 2018. One reason the administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump gave for withdrawing from the agreement was concern that it did not restrict Iran’s strategic missile program. Iran has said that it is not seeking to develop nuclear weapons and that its rocket tests do not have military objectives. European delegates to the talks for weeks have warned that they are close to collapsing. In a joint statement on December 28, they said: “We are clear that we are nearing the point where Iran’s escalation of its nuclear program will have completely hollowed out” the 2015 agreement. Iran's chief negotiator at the talks, Ali Bagheri, said on December 30 that the talks had seen some progress. "Some written changes on the lifting of sanctions were established between the two parties and relatively satisfactory progress has been made over the first days of the eighth round of negotiations," Bagheri said in a video published by Tasnim. Negotiations to restore the agreement began earlier this year but were put on hold in June as the Islamic republic held its presidential election, which brought an ultraconservative government led by President Ebrahim Raisi to power. They resumed in late November, and the latest round got under way on December 27. The nuclear deal offered Iran relief from sanctions that have weighed heavily on its economy. Bagheri said on December 30 that the discussions had recently focused mainly on the lifting of sanctions. "We hope that after a few days of pause, more serious work will continue on the question of lifting sanctions," he continued. Talks are due to resume on January 3.

The United States voiced concern on December 30 over Iran's new space launch, saying such activities use technology that can help further its ballistic-missile program. "The United States remains concerned with Iran's development of space launch vehicles, which pose a significant proliferation concern," a State Department spokesperson said after Iran announced it had launched a rocket carrying three satellites. The space launch vehicles "incorporate technologies that are virtually identical to, and interchangeable with, those used in ballistic missiles, including longer-range systems," the spokesperson said. The spokesperson also said the launch violated UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which backed the 2015 nuclear deal and called on Iran not to carry out work on ballistic missiles with the potential to carry nuclear warheads. Earlier on December 30, Defense Ministry spokesman Ahmad Hosseini said the rocket used was an Iranian Simorgh (Phoenix) rocket and that the payload reached an altitude of 470 kilometers. It was unclear whether any objects had successfully entered Earth’s orbit. Iran’s Tasnim news agency quoted Hosseini as saying the launch was a “space research mission.” He said the "performance of the space center and the performance of the satellite carrier were satisfactory." State television showed footage of the rocket launching from the Imam Khomeini Spaceport near the northern city of Semnan. The reported launch comes amid difficult negotiations in Vienna between Tehran and world powers over reviving the nuclear deal aimed at restricting Iran's nuclear program. That deal has been under threat since the United States withdrew from it and reimposed sanctions against Iran in 2018. One reason the administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump gave for withdrawing from the agreement was concern that it did not restrict Iran’s strategic missile program. Iran has said that it is not seeking to develop nuclear weapons and that its rocket tests do not have military objectives.

The Iranian Foreign Ministry has stressed that advancement in science and research, including in aerospace field, is an inalienable right of the Iranian nation, lambasting meddlesome comments by the United States over Iran’s recent launch of a satellite carrier. Iran’s Defense Ministry on Thursday announced that the country’s domestically-built satellite carrier rocket, Simorgh (Phoenix), successfully launched three research devices in a space research mission that scored yet another achievement for the Islamic Republic’s civilian space program. Later on Thursday, the US State Department said Washington “remains concerned with Iran’s development of space launch vehicles.” It also claimed that such satellite launches would violate a UN Security Council resolution, calling on the Islamic Republic to steer clear of any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads. On Friday, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh condemned comments by the White House, stressing that scientific and research progress, including in the field of aerospace, is the Iranian nation’s inalienable right and that such meddlesome statements would not break Iranians' resolve to progress in that field. “No resolution prevents the Islamic Republic of Iran from continuing its space program and the related experiments, including in the field of satellites-carriers, thus, citing UNSC Resolution 2231 is purely fallacious and fundamentally untrue,” he stressed. “As previously stated, the Islamic Republic of Iran has the right to use peaceful technologies in the path of its scientific-research development according to international standards, and in so doing, it will not await the opinions of some countries that seek to impose their dictates,” Khatibzadeh added. He also paid tribute to young Iranian scientists for their remarkable achievements in the field of aerospace despite illegal and unjust sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic.

Here's What You Need to Remember: In September 2003, U.S. authorities nabbed Iranian Serzhik Avasappian in a South Florida hotel as part of a sting operation. Agents had showed Avasappian several F-14 parts worth $800,000 and arrested him after he offered to buy the components. Tensions have escalated in the Persian Gulf region in the aftermath of U.S. president Donald Trump’s decision unilaterally to withdraw the United States from the agreement limiting Iran’s nuclear program. The U.S. military has implicated Iranian agents in several summer 2019 attacks on civilian ships sailing near Iran. The U.S. Navy sent the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and her strike group to the region. The U.S. Air Force deployed B-52 bombers and F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters. If war breaks out, American forces likely will attempt to secure Gulf air space by destroying or suppressing Iran’s air forces. The regular Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force and the air wing of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps militia together operate around 700 aircraft. The IRIAF’s 1970s-vintage F-14s could be U.S. forces’ first targets. According to a survey by Flight Global, the Iranian air force in 2019 operates around 24 F-14 Tomcats from a batch of 79 of the Grumman-made, swing-wing fighters that Iran acquired in the mid-1970s before the Islamic revolution. The U.S. Navy retired its last Tomcat in 2006. But with its long range and powerful radar, the F-14 remains one of the world’s most capable fighters. For that reason, the Americans for many years have been trying to ground the Ayatollah’s F-14s. Sixty-eight of Iran’s F-14s survived the Iran-Iraq War that ended in 1988. Sanctions that the United States imposed after the 1979 revolution prevented Iran from openly acquiring spare parts for the heavyweight fighters. Tehran established self-sufficiency programs—not just in the air force, but across the nation’s economy—in an effort to satisfy material needs that foreign companies had once met. In many sectors, the self-sufficiency initiative worked. Besides producing all its own oil, Iran has declared itself autonomous in agriculture, steel production, electricity generation and civil aviation. But Iranian companies struggled to produce all the specialized parts that the Tomcat requires. Tehran turned to the black market, paying huge sums to shady middlemen to sneak F-14 parts into Iran. American authorities became aware of the illicit trade as early as 1998. In March that year, federal agents arrested Iranian-born Parviz Lavi at his home in Long Island, charging him with violating U.S. export law by attempting to buy up spare parts for the F-14’s TF-30 engine and ship them to Iran via The Netherlands. Lavi got five years in prison plus a $125,000 fine. More arrests followed. In 1998, an aircraft parts vendor in San Diego told U.S. customs officials that Multicore Ltd. in California had requested price information for air intake seals used only on the F-14. Agents arrested Multicore’s Saeed Homayouni, a naturalized Canadian from Iran, and Yew Leng Fung, a Malaysian citizen. “Bank records subpoenaed by the Customs Service showed that Multicore Ltd. had made 399 payments totaling $2.26 million to military parts brokers since 1995 and had received deposits of $2.21 million,” The Washington Post reported . The company shipped parts mostly through Singapore. The feds began investigating 18 companies that had supplied airplane components to Multicore. In September 2003, U.S. authorities nabbed Iranian Serzhik Avasappian in a South Florida hotel as part of a sting operation. Agents had showed Avasappian several F-14 parts worth $800,000 and arrested him after he offered to buy the components. “While these components may appear relatively innocuous to the untrained eye, they are tightly controlled for good reason,” Immigration and Customs Enforcement interim agent Jesus Torres said in a statement. “In the wrong hands, they pose a potential threat to Americans at home and abroad.” Even with U.S. authorities tamping down on the illicit trade in F-14 parts, Iran persisted. After shutting down Multicore, the feds confiscated the firm’s Tomcat components and sent them to the Defense Department’s surplus-parts office. In 2005, a company—allegedly Iranian—bought the very same parts from the military. The parts war escalated after the U.S. Navy retired its last F-14s in 2006, leaving Iran as the type’s only operator. In 2007, U.S. agents even seized four intact ex-U.S. Navy F-14s in California—three at museums and one belonging to a producer on the military-themed T.V. show JAG—charging that the F-14s had not been properly stripped of useful parts that could wind up in Iranian hands. The U.S. Congress was furious at the Pentagon for its lax handling of the F-14-parts problem. Rep. Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, described it as “a huge breakdown, an absolute, huge breakdown.” Lawmakers passed a bill specifically banning any trade in Tomcat components to Iran or any other entity, and then-president George W. Bush signed the law in 2008. A minor tragedy unfolded as the military paid contractors to dismantle, crush and shred many of the approximately 150 retired F-14s. Scores of old F-14s—properly “demilitarized”—are still on display in museums across the United States. But none remain at the famous airplane “boneyard” in Arizona, where the Pentagon stores retired planes just in case it needs them again. Even so, the underground trade in Tomcat parts continues, with shady companies scouring the planet for leftover components. In early 2014, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security investigated Israeli arms dealers that it said had twice tried to send F-14 spares to Iran. And in late 2016, an aviation expert from Dallas named Erik Johnston, a representative of the Fort Worth Aviation Museum and a Union Pacific railroad worker discovered the hulks of two old F-14s on private land in Temple, Texas. According to The Houston Chronicle, the F-14s somehow wound up in Temple in the late 1980s after the government paid a contractor to scrap the two jets. It was a suspicious find. Johnston said he was shocked the F-14s for so long escaped the U.S. government’s notice, especially considering Iran’s strong interest in the type. "The thing that kept stumping us — was why the F-14s were there," Johnston mused. David Axe was Defense Editor of the National Interest. He is the author of the graphic novels War Fix, War Is Boring and Machete Squad. This first appeared in July 2019. Image: Wikipedia.

News article:
(MENAFN- Gulf Times) Iran announced yesterday it has carried out a new space launch, in a move likely to irk Western powers amid tough talks on reviving a 2015 nuclear deal. Tehran successfully put its first military satellite into orbit in April 2020, drawing a sharp rebuke from Washington. Western governments worry that satellite launch systems incorporate technologies interchangeable with those used in ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead. Iran insists its space programme is for civilian and defence purposes only, and does not breach the nuclear deal or any other international agreement. UN Security Council Resolution 2231 of 2015, endorsing the nuclear deal, imposed no blanket ban on Iranian rocket or missile launches. Iran's state broadcaster aired footage of a rocket rising from a desert launchpad, but gave no details of its location.“The Simorgh (Phoenix) satellite launcher carried three research cargoes into space,” said defence ministry spokesman Ahmad Hosseini.“The research goals foreseen for this launch have been achieved,” he added, quoted by state television. Earlier this month US media reported that preparations for a launch were under way at Iran's space centre in Semnan, 300km east of Tehran. Hosseini did not elaborate on the nature of the research, but he said the latest operation was a“preliminary launch” and that more would follow. In February, Iran announced it had launched its most powerful solid fuel rocket to date, the Zoljanah, boasting that it can put a 220-kg payload into orbit. The United States voiced concern about that launch, saying the test could boost Iran's ballistic missile technology at a time when the two nations are inching back to diplomacy. According to the Pentagon and satellite imagery of the Semnan centre, an Iranian satellite launch failed in mid-June, reports denied by Tehran. Iran's declared new space launch comes amid talks underway in Vienna between the Islamic republic and world powers to restore the 2015 nuclear agreement. The deal offered Tehran much-needed relief from sanctions and curtailed Iran's nuclear activities. But the unilateral withdrawal by then-US president Donald Trump derailed the deal, and prompted Tehran to walk back on its commitments under it. Talks to revive it began in late November, with an eighth round getting underway Monday. Yesterday, Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri said“relatively satisfactory progress” has been made. “Some written changes on the lifting of sanctions were established between the two parties,” Bagheri, said in a video published by Tasnim news agency. The UN Security Council Resolution endorsing the nuclear deal did not ban Iran from launching missiles or rockets. But it called on it“not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology”. Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia are taking part in the Vienna talks with Iran, while the United States is participating indirectly. “There may have been some modest progress,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Tuesday.

The United States voiced concern about that launch, saying the test could boost Iran's ballistic missile technology at a time when the two nations are inching back to diplomacy. According to the Pentagon and satellite imagery of the Semnan centre, an Iranian satellite launch failed in mid-June, reports denied by Tehran. Iran's declared new space launch comes amid talks underway in Vienna between the Islamic republic and world powers to restore the 2015 nuclear agreement. The deal offered Tehran much-needed relief from sanctions and curtailed Iran's nuclear activities. But the unilateral withdrawal by then-US president Donald Trump derailed the deal, and prompted Tehran to walk back on its commitments under it. Talks to revive it began in late November, with an eighth round getting under way on Monday. On Thursday, Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri said 'relatively satisfactory progress' has been made. 'Some written changes on the lifting of sanctions were established between the two parties,' Bagheri, said in a video published by Tasnim news agency. The UN Security Council Resolution endorsing the nuclear deal did not ban Iran from launching missiles or rockets. But it called on it 'not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology'. Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia are taking part in the Vienna talks with Iran, while the United States is participating indirectly. 'There may have been some modest progress,' State Department spokesman Ned Price said Tuesday.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran displayed three ballistic missiles at an outdoor prayer esplanade in central Tehran on Friday as talks in Vienna aimed at reviving Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers flounder.

News article:
The spokesman for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said Saturday that Iran’s recent show of force in military drills was acting as a deterrent for Israel’s “empty threats” against Tehran. Brigadier General Ramezan Sharif claimed that Israel had subdued its rhetoric against Iran in the wake of military drills held by Tehran. Most recently, Tehran held a five-day annual exercise last month which culminated in the firing of multiple ballistic missiles that generals said were a warning to Israel and included a mock strike on Israel’s nuclear facility. “After the exercise, the Zionists’ prime minister officially ordered their military figures not to talk about Iran at all,” Sharif claimed in an interview with al-Alam news channel, cited by the Fars news agency. Sharif said Iran assessed that Israel was interested in carrying out strikes against its nuclear program, but that the location of the sites would prevent it. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “Regardless of whether they act or not, our assessment is that [the threats] are rhetoric intended for political gains, especially to overcome their problems in their occupied lands, which makes them try to distract [the public] with an external issue,” Sharif said. Israel has reportedly approved a budget of some NIS 5 billion ($1.6 billion) to be used to prepare the military for a potential strike against Iran’s nuclear program. It includes funds for various types of aircraft, intelligence-gathering drones and unique armaments needed for such an attack, which would have to target heavily fortified underground sites. Advertisement Sharif’s comments came a day after Iran displayed three ballistic missiles at an outdoor prayer esplanade in central Tehran. The missiles — known as Dezful, Qiam and Zolfaghar — have official ranges of up to 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) and are already-known models, the Revolutionary Guard said. A report by Iranian state television said the missiles on display were the same types as those used to strike United States bases in Iraq. The display came on the second anniversary of a ballistic missile attack on bases housing American troops in Iraq in retaliation for the US drone strike that killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad in 2020.

The accord collapsed in 2018 when then-US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the deal and re-imposed sanctions on Iran as Tehran began to publicly flout the terms of the agreement. Israel has long maintained its opposition to US plans to return to the terms of the original deal and has said it will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said last month that Israel is “without a doubt not a party to the deal in Vienna if it will happen.” In response to recent public comments by Israel Defense Forces officials that Israel was ready to strike Iran at any moment, Bennett said: “I’m in favor of speaking little and doing a lot.” Associated Press contributed to this report.

News article:
Iran’s war machine pursues ballistic and nuclear supremacy Baria Alamuddin Short Url https://arab.news/g7cqq The head of US military operations in the Middle East, Gen. Frank McKenzie, recognizes that Iran and its proxies have achieved “overmatch” — the ability to fire many more missiles than adversaries such as Israel and the US can shoot down or destroy. “Iran’s missiles have become a more immediate threat than its nuclear program,” he says. While its citizens starve, Iran has become a leading global missile producer, with the largest and most diverse arsenal in the Middle East, including thousands of ballistic missiles with a range of more than 2,000km. A disturbing report in The New Yorker argues that Tehran’s cruise missiles have fundamentally altered the balance of power in the Gulf region. A series of Iranian tests in late December included the simultaneous deployment of missiles and drone attacks against the same target, similar to a previous Iranian attack on GCC oil infrastructure. Iran is meanwhile seeking to capitalize on Chinese technology to develop projectiles that can circumvent missile defense systems. Experts believe North Korea is now importing Iranian missile technology. “Everybody should know that all American bases and their vessels in a distance of up to 2,000km are within the range of our missiles,” bragged Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of Iran’s Aerospace Force. “We have constantly prepared ourselves for a fully fledged war,” he crowed, as if “fully fledged war” were an optimum outcome for the region. Meanwhile, the firing of rockets by Iranian proxies at GCC and Western targets in the region is now a near-daily phenomenon. There are substantial increases in military spending — including more than doubling the allocation for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps —in Iran’s 2022 budget, despite its income estimates being based on the assumption of no new nuclear deal. A Washington Institute analysis concluded: “The Raisi government sees no economic urgency to making substantial nuclear concessions.” Experts warn that Iran is a few short months, or weeks, away from nuclear breakout capacity, with increasingly advanced centrifuges enriching uranium to 60 percent purity. Former Mossad intelligence director Zohar Palti estimates that Iran would require just three weeks to produce sufficient fuel for a bomb. Western officials are even less optimistic about extracting concessions from Iran on its ballistic missile program than they are about the nuclear program. Raisi declared: “Regional issues or the missile issue are non-negotiable.” Iran’s increasing reliance on drones, cyberattacks and unconventional warfare aspires to give Tehran a decisive military advantage over its neighbors. “Iran has proved that it is using its ballistic missile program as a means to coerce or intimidate its neighbors,” noted Biden’s nuclear negotiator, Robert Malley. If diplomats and leaders in the Arab region and the wider world don’t rapidly get serious, Iran’s missile, nuclear and paramilitary programs soon won’t be an abstract matter of statistics and research data, but will be deployed in anger to rain death and destruction upon the region. Baria Alamuddin After the January 2020 US assassination of Qassem Soleimani, Iran fired a barrage of ballistic missiles with thousand-pound warheads at a US base in Iraq — the largest ballistic missile attack by any nation on American troops. Hours later, Iranian forces shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet just after it took off from Tehran airport, killing all 176 people on board. Coinciding with the anniversary of Soleimani’s death, there was a display in central Tehran last week of the rockets used by Iran in these retaliatory strikes. However, in the western city of Shahrekord, a newly erected statue of Soleimani was set on fire and destroyed by Iraniansclearly unimpressed by their leaders’ squandering the nation’s wealth on overseas warmaking. Tehran’s military arsenals are shielded deep underground in massive complexes in its satellite states and in Iran itself. With these tunnelled “missile cities” stretching for many kilometers, Iran boasts the largest underground complexes in the region, housing both nuclear and missile programs. Albu-Kamal on the Syria-Iraq border is one of these sites. It is a major transit point for the transfer of missiles and munitions into Lebanon and Syria, and a site where rockets are upgraded to increase range and accuracy. In early 2021 Biden ordered the bombing of Albu-Kamal in retaliation for rocket attacks by Hashd militias in Iraq, but the strikes had negligible impact. “Without being able to crater the place, you’re not going to stop the flow,” one Biden intelligence official said. Ironically, Israeli military strikes and sophisticated sabotage operations have simply made Iran’s proliferation programs more resilient, by necessitating the construction of massive defenses and the installation of increasingly advanced equipment. Israeli generals have expressed frustration at the Biden administration holding up the transfer of military equipment required for dealing decisively with these capabilities. In an era when rogue states can menace global security with impunity, we require nothing short of an international compact regarding the balance and constraint of military power, and legally enforced respect for sovereignty. For decades China and Russia colluded to undermine international law, but with Russia sending thousands of troops into Kazakhstan and menacing Ukraine and other former Soviet states, suddenly Beijing finds itself encircled. All states benefit from a universally recognized system whereby no overmighty coalition of states or rogue entities can threaten the sovereignty of others. Even Vladimir Putin claims his aggressive actions simply seek to protect Russian territorial integrity. When pariah states can build up immense military arsenals to menace their neighbors without consequences, the international system disintegrates. Whether with Khomeinist Iran or Nazi Germany, when we appease aggressor states, we ultimately find ourselves facing a monster 10 times its original size. Only 15 years ago, the primitive Iran-manufactured rockets that could be deployed by Hezbollah and Tehran’s other proxies were the stuff of ridicule, but nobody is laughing now. In the 15 years since Iran was referred to the UN Security Council for its uranium enrichment activities — and years of negotiations with global powers,supposedly to halt Tehran’s proliferation activities — it has developed into a ballistic superpower. Vigorous ballistic weapons development and testing took place before, during and after Barack Obama’s 2015 nuclear deal. The failure of global powers to recognize the long-term security consequences of what was happening under their noses has brought us to where we are today. This is not scaremongering, but recognizing reality and deciding how to act. If diplomats and leaders in the Arab region and the wider world don’t rapidly get serious, Iran’s missile, nuclear and paramilitary programs soon won’t be an abstract matter of statistics and research data, but will be deployed in anger to rain death and destruction upon the region. Do we seriously want to sit back and wait for this to happen? Baria Alamuddin is an award-winning journalist and broadcaster in the Middle East and the UK.

Defense Minister Benny Gantz is expected to meet next week with Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, Channel 12 News reported. This will be the second meeting between Gantz and Abbas this year, and comes against the backdrop of a series of lone-wolf terrorist attacks in Jerusalem, including one fatal attack. The purpose of the latest meeting is to strengthen Abbas and the Palestinian Authority, so that Hamas will not be strengthened in Judea and Samaria. Several proposals for security and economic cooperation that will assist the PA in its day-to-day operations will be presented. Regional Cooperation Minister Issawi Frej will also join Gantz in his visit to Ramallah. Frej told Channel 12 News that the situation in the PA is "on the verge of collapse." "The mood of the PA spreads to its citizens. It controls the area through 200,000 salaries, and it does not have the ability to pay it so it pays half salaries, resulting in it having no control over the street." According to him, this is the cause of the current wave of terrorism. Gantz previously met with Abbas in August to discuss measures to strengthen the PA's economy. Following the meeting, Israel agreed to loan the PA NIS 500 million.

News article:
Ramallah - Kifah Zboun Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas suggested to the United States, Egypt, Jordan, and other parties that the negotiations with Israeli parties begin with “border demarcation,” a well-informed Palestinian source told Asharq Al-Awsat. The source added that President Abbas would present his suggestions to the Israeli Defense Minister, Benny Gantz, during their meeting next week in Ramallah. The president will inform Gantz that confidence-building measures and support for the Palestinian Authority (PA) are in no way a substitute for political negotiations, warning that he will resort to measures if the Israeli government does not engage in such talks. The Palestinian source confirmed that Abbas would inform Gantz that the plan he launched at the UN would be implemented if the current Israeli government insisted on following a path away from political negotiations. In September, Abbas launched an initiative during which he gave Israel has one year to withdraw from the Palestinian territory it occupied in 1967, including East Jerusalem, threatening to withdraw recognition of Israel. The Central Council, the highest Palestinian legislative body, will discuss various options if it holds its upcoming meeting at the beginning of next month. Abbas will meet Gantz next week, accompanied by the Israeli Regional Cooperation Minister Issawi Frej. Frej said he believes that the meeting aims to strengthen the PA and calm tensions amid a wave of attacks. The meeting, which will be Gantz and Abbas’ second meeting, is also expected to address security and economic cooperation. In a meeting that aimed to break the deadlock in relations, Abbas first met with Gantz in late August at the presidential headquarters in the central West Bank. After the meeting, Israel authorized permits to work in Israel for an additional 15,000 Palestinian workers. It allowed the Palestinian territories to get 4G cellular service. It also agreed to grant tens of thousands of Palestinians the right to family reunification. But Gantz ignored requests to return the bodies of dozens of Palestinians held by Israel, stop storming Palestinian areas classified as A, work to stop settler violence in the West Bank, and reformulate the Paris Agreements regulating economic relations between the two parties. Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said that his government strongly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state and that state-like entities do not succeed. Bennett also believes that no one in the region believes it is possible to go to a peace negotiation process. Sources confirmed to Asharq Al-Awsat that regional countries, along with the US administration, sent messages to Abbas stating that the current situation does not allow the launch of a political process due to the composition of the current Israeli government. As a result, Abbas decided to present an initiative based on launching negotiations or escalation. “I had a conversation this week with Gantz… and I believe in the coming days there will be an interesting meeting,” Frej told Channel 12 news. Asked if he meant another meeting between the defense minister and Abbas, Frej said the two may “meet again.” The meeting would likely deal with proposals for security and economic cooperation aimed at helping the PA govern in the West Bank and weakening the rival Hamas group. Abbas is trying to push a political solution forward, and for that, he visited Russia, Jordan, Qatar, and other countries. Abbas also requested meetings with Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid. However, it was not clear if Lapid would respond to the Egyptian request to meet Abbas and join Gantz on his visit to Ramallah. Bennett has refused to meet with Abbas so far, considering that it is useless in the current circumstances.

News article:
The head of the first major Arab party to enter a government coalition said Tuesday that Israel’s status as a Jewish state could not be changed, advising the Arab community to follow his pragmatic approach rather than trying to challenge the country’s identity. Mansour Abbas’s comments during a conference held by the Globes newsmagazine in Tel Aviv tracked closely with his attempts to raise his community’s profile by working from within the government, a strategy that some fellow Arab politicians have criticized as selling out the Palestinian national cause. “Israel was born as a Jewish state. And that was the decision of the Jewish people, to establish a Jewish state. The question is not ‘what is the identity of the state?’ That’s how the state was born, and so it will remain,” said Abbas, the head of the Islamist Ra’am party. Arab Israelis have struggled for decades with their identity as a national minority inside the avowedly Jewish state. Some identify as Palestinian, others as Arab Israeli, and still others simply as Arab or Bedouin. Abbas told the audience that he had protested the 2017 Nation-State law, which enshrined the state’s Jewish identity in legislation. But he also told them “not to give ourselves illusions.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “This is the reality. The question is not the about the state’s identity — but what the status of Arab citizens will be in it,” Abbas said. Abbas’s Ra’am party is the first Arab Israeli party to join an Israeli coalition government in decades. Since becoming part of the coalition in June, Ra’am has sought to advance policies that benefit Arab Israelis while keeping the fragile government together. During the March election campaign, Abbas pledged tangible results for his voters, saying that his party offered a “realistic” approach to solving everyday problems in Arab communities, from rising crime to a severe housing shortage. Advertisement Abbas’s critics say forgoing discussion of Palestinian identity will not help bring achievements for Arab Israelis in what is fundamentally a national conflict. “The question of the status of the Palestinian minority in Israel is fundamentally tied to the definition of the state as a Jewish state,” said MK Sami Abou Shehadeh, who represents the nationalist Balad faction of the Joint List party in the Knesset, in response to Abbas’s remarks on Tuesday. Ayman Odeh, who leads the Joint List, a bloc of four mostly Arab parties, slammed Abbas’ remarks as well, saying that “the question of the state’s identity should interest every citizen — Arab or Jew — who cares about peace and democracy.” “We are not subjects, we are the children of this homeland, citizens by right, and we will continue to work for a state of equality and democracy,” said Odeh. Abbas has made similar statements in recent weeks to Arabic-language media, encouraging Arab Israelis to accept the Jewish nature of the state as a fact on the ground. “Israel is a Jewish state. That is its identity, its essence. From their perspective, if its Jewish nature is taken away, the state will have vanished as well. Whether you accept it or not — that is a personal matter,” Abbas said during an interview with the Arabic-language publication Kul al-Arab in November. Advertisement “The essential question for us as Arabs is what our status is in this country. Period. Next page,” Abbas said. He also suggested avoiding what he deemed “lost battles.” The stance is rooted in the Ra’am party charter, which advocates using Arab citizenship and political participation in Israeli state institutions as a practical tool to advance the status of Arab Israelis. “I see myself as a full citizen of the State of Israel, and I want my full rights. What’s the difference between me and [other Arab Israeli politicians]? I am utilizing my citizenship,” Abbas said to Kul al-Arab. But during his November interview, Abbas was careful to add that he had not forgotten his Palestinian identity, either. “My rights don’t just come from my citizenship. My rights also come from being a member of the Palestinian people, a son of this Palestinian homeland. And whether we like it or not, the State of Israel, with its identity, was established inside the Palestinian homeland,” Abbas said.

© David Goldman/AP Background Backlash "I'm sorry for being blunt, but you are simply contemptible. Hundreds of thousands of heroic residents of Judea and Samaria [Zionist-speak for greater Palestine] absorb terrorism on a daily basis and have paid a heavy price, and you shed their blood with wretchedness and participate in a false and antisemitic campaign that defames them in order to look enlightened and please a bunch of hypocrites. Shame on you, little man." "You are confused, the settlers are the salt of the earth [...] The violence over which we must be shocked is the dozens of incidents of rock-throwing and firing on Jews that happen every day - only because they are Jews, and all this with the encouragement and support of the PA. I recommend that you talk about this violence with Ms. Nuland." Demand for resignation © Activestills Settler violence The latest drama in Israeli politics comes in the form ofover what constitutes "settler violence." As Israeli lawmaker Ofer Cassif said to me during an interview I conducted with him in Jerusalem, the vast majority of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, represents extreme right-wing Zionists.Recently a new storm brewed afterof the Labor Party met with theIn a tweet he posted after the meeting, Barlev said thathimself the son of a retired IDF colonel and former commander of the Sayeret Matkal . In the violent and hate-filled discourse that exists among Israelis, anyone who served, let alone commanded this murderous brigade, is considered a god. Among the Israeli politicians who served in this unit are two former prime ministers:Zionist settlements in the West Bank would not have been possible without the support of the Zionist Labor-Left, who were in power in the years after the 1967 conquest of the West Bank. Labor-Left Zionists were also responsible for the Zionist settlements in the larger part of Palestine that was occupied in 1948. However, for reasons beyond understanding, Labor-Left Zionists abhor the West Bank settlers while they see the pre-1967 settlers as heroes and pioneers.Barlev is a member of the Israeli Labor Party, which is part of the coalition government led by the former head of the West Bank Settlers movement, Naftali Bennett. Zionists who align themselves with the Labor or Meretz political parties, like to think of themselves as better than the settlers who are part of the more blatantly racist and violent Religious-Zionist movement.Religious-Zionist politicians and their supporters immediately came out against Barlev. The leader of the Zionist-Religious Party,tweeted:Interior Minister Ayelet Shaked also distanced herself from Minister Barlev's remarks, tweeting:An attack by Palestinian resistance fighters against Israeli settlers near the city of Nablus in the northern West Bank took place on the night of December 16 and resulted in two settlers injured and one dead. Immediately after this, West Bank settler spokespeople began a campaign of- who, as mentioned earlier, was himself the leader of the West Bank settlements at one point -They all claim that Barlev's comments condemning the violent attacks by settlers against Palestinians somehow encourage and embolden Palestinians to attack Israeli settlers.Truth be told, Palestinians do not need Barlev to motivate them to retaliate against Israeli violence. Be it by soldiers or settler gangs, Palestinians are constantly killed, their property destroyed, their lands taken away and their children detained and tortured. One has to be quite insane to expect that there would be no retribution.What is settler violence?When Barlev and his father before him served in the IDF, they were in fact doing the work of setters and colonizers by terrorizing Palestinians.and as such, they use enormous amounts of violence against a people who have never so much as possessed a tank or a warplane, let alone an actual army.If Under Secretary of State Nuland was really worried about settler violence in Palestine,such as the Palestinian-Bedouin in the Naqab whose homes are demolished at an alarming rate of 2,000 per year.in the cities of Lydd and Ramle and Yaffa to hear about the terror they endure at the hands of Zionist terror gangs.who suffer from settler violence inflicted both by soldiers and by armed Zionist gangs who wear no uniform.The hypocrisy never ends. Now that a Palestinian actually retaliated against Zionist settler violence, there will be even more violence inflicted on Palestinians.

Defense Minister Benny Gantz hosted Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas at his home in Rosh Ha’ayin on Tuesday night. It marked the first time the Palestinian leader held talks with a senior Israeli official in Israel since 2010. The meeting was Gantz and Abbas’s second since the new Israeli government was formed in June. According to the Defense Ministry, it lasted two and a half hours; part of it was Abbas and Gantz alone. “The defense minister emphasized the shared interest in strengthening security cooperation, preserving security stability, and preventing terrorism and violence,” Gantz’s office said in a statement. Gantz also told Abbas that he intended to continue advancing “confidence-building measures in civil and economic fields,” according to the Defense Ministry.

Prime Minister Naftali Bennett is opposed to renewed peace negotiations with the Palestinians and has refused to meet with Abbas. Nevertheless, his government has pledged to prop up the Palestinian Authority and strengthen its ailing economy, with Gantz spearheading the move. Gantz has said he sees Abbas’s regime as the only alternative to an empowered Hamas in the West Bank. “If the Palestinian Authority is stronger, Hamas will be weaker. When the Palestinian Authority has more ability to enforce order, there will be more security, and our hand will be forced less,” Gantz said in late August.

Abbas’s last official meeting in Israel took place in 2010 when he met then-prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his official residence for peace talks. The peace process has been largely moribund in the last decade with Netanyahu working to undermine Abbas and push the conflict with the Palestinians to the margins. Abbas also traveled to Jerusalem for the 2016 funeral of Israeli statesman Shimon Peres.

Mahmoud Abbas held talks with Israel's Benny Gantz at the latter's residence, according to a Palestinian official. Israel said the two discussed "security and civil matters." Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met with Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz on Tuesday during a rare trip to Israel. It was the latest in a series of meetings between top Israeli officials and the Palestinian leader. In late August, the defense minister visited the Palestinian Authority's headquarters in the West Bank for talks with Abbas — the first official meeting at such a level in several years. According to a senior Palestinian official, Tuesday's meeting marked the first time Abbas met with an Israeli official in Israel since 2010. The late-night talks took place at Gantz's home in central Israel, a senior Palestinian official said. What did they discuss? "The two men discussed security and civil matters," the Israeli Defense Ministry said in a statement. Gantz told Abbas that he intended to "continue to promote actions to strengthen confidence in the economic and civilian fields, as agreed during their last meeting," it added. Hussein al-Sheikh, the Palestinian civil affairs minister and a key aide to Abbas, said the meeting "dealt with the importance of creating a political horizon" that leads to a political solution in accordance with international legitimacy resolutions. He said the pair discussed "the tense field conditions due to the practices of settlers," adding that the meeting dealt with "many security, economic and humanitarian issues." No ongoing peace process Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said after the meeting in August that there weren't any ongoing peace talks with the Palestinians, "and there won't be one." While the right-wing leader opposes Palestinian statehood, he has said he wants to reduce friction with the Palestinian Authority and improve living conditions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel advances plans for new settler homes To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Israeli-Palestinian relations have substantially deteriorated in recent years. Several instances of violence have been reported in the West Bank in recent weeks, including a series of Palestinian attacks on Israelis as well as a surge in violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians. Peace talks were suspended in 2014, and Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank have since expanded. The Palestinian Authority seeks an independent state that includes all of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. adi/fb (AFP, AP)

Gantz told Abbas that he intended to "continue to promote actions to strengthen confidence in the economic and civilian fields, as agreed during their last meeting," it added. Hussein al-Sheikh, the Palestinian civil affairs minister and a key aide to Abbas, said the meeting "dealt with the importance of creating a political horizon" that leads to a political solution in accordance with international legitimacy resolutions. He said the pair discussed "the tense field conditions due to the practices of settlers," adding that the meeting dealt with "many security, economic and humanitarian issues." No ongoing peace process Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said after the meeting in August that there weren't any ongoing peace talks with the Palestinians, "and there won't be one." While the right-wing leader opposes Palestinian statehood, he has said he wants to reduce friction with the Palestinian Authority and improve living conditions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel advances plans for new settler homes To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Israeli-Palestinian relations have substantially deteriorated in recent years. Several instances of violence have been reported in the West Bank in recent weeks, including a series of Palestinian attacks on Israelis as well as a surge in violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians. Peace talks were suspended in 2014, and Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank have since expanded. The Palestinian Authority seeks an independent state that includes all of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. adi/fb (AFP, AP)

In addition, Gantz okayed the status approval of some 6,000 Palestinian residents of the West Bank and 3,500 Gazans in the PA’s Population Registry, which is under Israeli control - meaning Israel will officially recognized the legal status of thousands of Palestinians, which will allow them freedom of movement within the Palestinian territories. 3 View gallery A car registered to the Palestinian territories on one of Israel's main roads ( Photo: Yoav Zitun ) The defense minister added there are a number of additional economic measures on the agenda, including lowering the handling fees for fuel purchases for the territories, the creation of an online VAT platform for Palestinians, as well as the creation of a dedicated digital platform that will enable Israeli employers to pay Palestinian workers on the spot. These measures, among others, are expected to add hundreds of millions of shekels to the authority's budget every year.

Right-wing members of Israel’s coalition government criticized Defense Minister Benny Gantz on Wednesday for meeting with Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas the day before. Gantz hosted Abbas at his home in central Israel on Tuesday to discuss a number of security and civilian topics. Gantz told Abbas that he intended to continue advancing “confidence-building measures” in the economic and civilian sphere, according to a government statement. “Gantz emphasized the parties’ shared interest in deepening security coordination, maintaining regional stability and preventing terror and violence,” the statement added. Housing and Construction Minister Ze’ev Elkin said that Gantz hadn’t been given authority from the government to conduct political negotiations, “and he knows it,” Channel 12 reported. Furthermore, Gantz’s decision to host Abbas while the latter still supports terrorists demonstrates the defense minister’s “poor taste,” said Elkin. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories “It would have been better if he had found another guest,” he said. Communications Minister Yoaz Hendel noted that Abbas still denies the Holocaust, and accused the Palestinian leader of playing “a very strange and double game.” “We have an interest in the Palestinian Authority being strong and stable in its field. We do not trust its people on security issues, but we have an interest in the P.A. not collapsing. If a meeting of this kind helps Gantz—it’s his decision. I personally would not do it,” he said, according to the report. This was the second meeting between Gantz and Abbas. The two met in August in what was the first high-level talks between Israeli and Palestinian leaders since 2010.

Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas gave Israel one year to withdraw from occupied territory or he said he would no long recognize the Israel based on pre-1967 borders In a virtual address to the United Nations General Assembly, Abbas called on Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to "convene an international peace conference." But along with that request he also issued an ultimatum. "We must state that Israel, the occupying power, has one year to withdraw from the Palestinian territory it occupied in 1967, including East Jerusalem," he said. Abbas added that the Palestinians were ready "to work throughout the year" on solving the final status of the states of Israel and Palestine "in accordance with United Nations resolutions." But "if this is not achieved, why maintain recognition of Israel based on the 1967 borders?" he said. Abbas added that the Palestinians would also go to the International Court of Justice "on the issue of the legality of the occupation of the land of the Palestinian state." The peace process to achieve a two-state solution between in the Middle East has been deadlocked for years. Israel immediately brushed aside the Palestinian leader's demands. Abbas "proved once again that he is no longer relevant," said the Israeli ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan. "Those who truly support peace and negotiations do not threaten delusional ultimatums from the UN platform as he did in his speech," he added. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas made a rare visit to Israel Tuesday for talks with Defence Minister Benny Gantz, which the defence ministry said focused on security and civil matters. Gantz told Abbas that he intended to "continue to promote actions to strengthen confidence in the economic and civilian fields, as agreed during their last meeting," the ministry statement said. "The two men discussed security and civil matters," it added. Israeli media reported that the meeting took place at Gantz's home in the central town of Rosh HaAyin. In late August, Gantz visited the Palestinian Authority's headquarters in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah for talks with Abbas, the first official meeting at such a level for several years. But after those talks, hawkish Prime Minister Naftali Bennett underlined that there was no peace process under way with the Palestinians, "and there won't be one". Palestinian Civil Affairs Minister Hussein al-Sheikh tweeted on Wednesday that Abbas met with Gantz. "The meeting dealt with the importance of creating a political horizon that leads to a political solution, in accordance with international resolutions," he said. The pair also discussed "the tense conditions on the ground due to the practices of settlers" as well as "many security, economic and humanitarian issues". Israel's right-wing opposition party Likud condemned the latest meeting, saying that "concessions dangerous for Israel's security were only a matter of time". Likud added a dismissive reference to Bennett's governing coalition, which includes an Israeli Arab party for the first time. "The Israeli-Palestinian government has put the Palestinians and Abbas back on the agenda... it is dangerous for Israel," Likud said. Deepens Palestinian divide Palestinian movement Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, also condemned the visit. It went against the "national spirit of our Palestinian people", a Hamas statement read. "This behaviour by the leadership of the Palestinian Authority deepens the Palestinian political divide, complicates the Palestinian situation, encourages those in the region who want to normalise relations with the occupier, and weakens the Palestinians' rejection of normalisation," Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said. The Gulf Arab states Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Morocco and Sudan, signed US-brokered normalisation deals with Israel during the presidency of Donald Trump. Relations between Israel and the Palestinians deteriorated sharply during Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu's record 12 years as prime minister, up to June this year. US-sponsored peace talks broke down in 2014 as Netanyahu oversaw an intensification of illegal Jewish settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank. Right-winger Bennett, the former head of a settler lobby group who opposes Palestinian statehood, leads a coalition of parties from the Jewish nationalist right and the left and centre. Gantz's meeting with Abbas follows a visit to the region by US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. *This story was edited by Ahram Online Search Keywords: Short link:

Heavy fog hangs over Jerusalem's old city and the Dome of the Rock Mosque Compound on Wednesday (AFP photo) OCCUPIED JERUSALEM — Israel unveiled a package of "confidence-building measures" for the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, after Defence Minister Benny Gantz hosted talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on his first visit in years. Abbas, leading a high-ranking delegation on his first visit to Israel for an official meeting since 2010, held talks with Gantz at his home in the central town of Rosh HaAyin, according to Israeli sources and media. "We discussed the implementation of economic and civilian measures, and emphasised the importance of deepening security coordination and preventing terror and violence — for the well-being of both Israelis and Palestinians," Gantz said after the meeting on Tuesday evening. On Wednesday, Israel's defence ministry announced "confidence-building measures" with the Palestinian Authority (PA). These included a $32 million advance payment to the PA in taxes collected on its behalf by Israel, and the granting of 600 extra permits allowing Palestinian businessmen to cross into Israel. It also announced the regularisation of 6,000 more Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank, which has been under Israeli control since the June War of 1967. Israel had already announced in October, for the first time since 2009, the regularisation of the status of 4,000 Palestinians living in the large swathe of the West Bank known as Area C, where Israel exercises civilian as well as military control. “The meeting dealt with the importance of creating a political horizon that leads to a political solution, in accordance with international resolutions,” Palestinian Civil Affairs Minister Hussein Al Sheikh said Wednesday. Excluding East Jerusalem, the West Bank is home to nearly 500,000 Jewish settlers, living in communities regarded as illegal under international law. The talks also covered “the tense conditions on the ground due to the practices of settlers” as well as “many security, economic and humanitarian issues”, Hussein Al Sheikh added. After Israel’s coalition government led by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett was formed in June, Gantz had visited the PA’s headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah in August for talks with Abbas, the first official meeting at such a level for several years. But after those talks, hawkish Bennett, the former head of a settler lobby group who opposes Palestinian statehood, underlined that there was no peace process under way with the Palestinians, “and there won’t be one”. Right-winger Bennett leads a motley coalition of parties ranging from the Jewish nationalist right to the left and centre. Israel’s right-wing opposition Likud Party condemned the latest meeting, saying that “concessions dangerous for Israel’s security are only a matter of time”. The party added a dismissive reference to Bennett’s governing coalition, which includes an Israeli Arab party for the first time. “The Israeli-Palestinian government has put the Palestinians and Abbas back on the agenda... it is dangerous for Israel,” the Likud said. ‘Deepens Palestinian divide’ Gantz’s meeting with Abbas follows a recent visit to the region by US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, with the administration of President Joe Biden seeking to reboot relations with the Palestinians that were broken under Donald Trump. Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, also condemned the visit. It went against the “national spirit of our Palestinian people”, a Hamas statement said. “This behaviour by the leadership of the Palestinian Authority deepens the Palestinian political divide, complicates the Palestinian situation, encourages those in the region who want to normalise relations with the occupier, and weakens the Palestinians’ rejection of normalisation,” Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said. Qassem was alluding to Gulf Arab states Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Morocco and Sudan, which signed US-brokered normalisation deals with Israel during the presidency of Trump.

These included a $32 million advance payment to the PA in taxes collected on its behalf by Israel, and the granting of 600 extra permits allowing Palestinian businessmen to cross into Israel. It also announced the regularisation of 6,000 more Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank, which has been under Israeli control since the June War of 1967. Israel had already announced in October, for the first time since 2009, the regularisation of the status of 4,000 Palestinians living in the large swathe of the West Bank known as Area C, where Israel exercises civilian as well as military control. “The meeting dealt with the importance of creating a political horizon that leads to a political solution, in accordance with international resolutions,” Palestinian Civil Affairs Minister Hussein Al Sheikh said Wednesday. Excluding East Jerusalem, the West Bank is home to nearly 500,000 Jewish settlers, living in communities regarded as illegal under international law. The talks also covered “the tense conditions on the ground due to the practices of settlers” as well as “many security, economic and humanitarian issues”, Hussein Al Sheikh added. After Israel’s coalition government led by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett was formed in June, Gantz had visited the PA’s headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah in August for talks with Abbas, the first official meeting at such a level for several years. But after those talks, hawkish Bennett, the former head of a settler lobby group who opposes Palestinian statehood, underlined that there was no peace process under way with the Palestinians, “and there won’t be one”. Right-winger Bennett leads a motley coalition of parties ranging from the Jewish nationalist right to the left and centre. Israel’s right-wing opposition Likud Party condemned the latest meeting, saying that “concessions dangerous for Israel’s security are only a matter of time”. The party added a dismissive reference to Bennett’s governing coalition, which includes an Israeli Arab party for the first time. “The Israeli-Palestinian government has put the Palestinians and Abbas back on the agenda... it is dangerous for Israel,” the Likud said. ‘Deepens Palestinian divide’ Gantz’s meeting with Abbas follows a recent visit to the region by US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, with the administration of President Joe Biden seeking to reboot relations with the Palestinians that were broken under Donald Trump. Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, also condemned the visit. It went against the “national spirit of our Palestinian people”, a Hamas statement said. “This behaviour by the leadership of the Palestinian Authority deepens the Palestinian political divide, complicates the Palestinian situation, encourages those in the region who want to normalise relations with the occupier, and weakens the Palestinians’ rejection of normalisation,” Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said. Qassem was alluding to Gulf Arab states Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Morocco and Sudan, which signed US-brokered normalisation deals with Israel during the presidency of Trump.

News article:
As details emerged from Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz’s Dec. 28 meeting at his private residence in Rosh Ha’ayin with Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas, many Israelis were left in shock. According to various reports, Gantz had offered Abbas a series of “confidence-building measures” as described by the Israeli Defense Ministry, which included economic benefits to the P.A. with regard to VAT, import taxes and excise duties; a NIS 100 million ($32.2 million) loan; 1,100 entry permits for Palestinian businessmen; and dozens of VIP permits for senior P.A. officials. Gantz’s other concession to the Palestinians includes the legalization of the status of 9,500 undocumented Palestinians and foreigners living in Judea, Samaria and Gaza. The question many Israelis are asking themselves is, what confidence-building measures did Israel receive from the Palestinians in return? And why is Israel offering so many significant concessions to the Palestinians in the first place? Efraim Inbar, president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, told JNS that the meeting had “a façade of intimacy that is inappropriate.” “All Israelis, including Gantz, should not forget that Abbas is not a friend, but the enemy,” he said. “He is a Holocaust denier, pays salaries to terrorists and refuses to recognize Israel as a Jewish state.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Inbar also noted that Mahmoud Abbas recently criticized United Arab Party leader Mansour Abbas, a member of Israel’s governing coalition, for admitting he lives in a Jewish state. Gantz’s office published a generic statement devoid of details, saying, “The defense minister emphasized the shared interest in strengthening security cooperation, preserving security stability, and preventing terrorism and violence.” But the details were subsequently publicized. By making these far-reaching concessions to the Palestinians – with no known Palestinian concessions in return – Gantz appears to be violating the 1994 Paris Protocol agreed to between Israel and the P.A. That agreement hammered out the details that would allow Israel to collect taxes on behalf of the P.A. and clarified what services Israel could charge for. Gantz has now made changes to the agreement without bringing any legislation to the Knesset for debate. What also makes this meeting difficult for many to understand is that Abbas is personally leading a campaign to prosecute Gantz in the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes. Israeli Housing Minister Ze’ev Elkin of the coalition’s right-wing New Hope party told Radio 103FM on Wednesday, “I wouldn’t have invited to my home someone who pays salaries to murderers of Israelis and also wants to put senior IDF officers in prison in The Hague, including the host himself.” The Likud released a statement calling Bennett’s government “an Israeli-Palestinian government that is returning Abbas and the Palestinians to the agenda… Concessions that will be dangerous to Israeli security are only a matter of time.” However, the meeting was praised by the United States, which has been pushing to renew ties with the Palestinian Authority that had largely been severed under Trump. “We hope confidence-building measures discussed will accelerate momentum to further advance freedom, security and prosperity for Palestinians and Israelis alike in 2022,” tweeted State Department Spokesman Ned Price. According to Maurice Hirsch, head of legal strategies at Palestinian Media Watch, the aim of the meeting was ostensibly to prop up the P.A. “The problem,” he said, “is the Palestinian people hate the P.A. so much, they would vote for Hamas in a heartbeat because of the perceived and real corruption and the feeling that there is complete and utter nepotism.” By meeting with Abbas and offering such far-reaching concessions to the Palestinians without demanding any concessions in return, Gantz is feeding into the perception of corruption, possibly driving more Palestinians toward Hamas and the terror group’s jihadist ideology against Israel. Hirsch said that the NIS 100 million loan for the Palestinians is “positively going to go to terrorists. It is outrageous.” “By giving money to the Palestinians, Israel is giving up leverage,” he said. Furthermore, Hirsch noted, Gantz is making agreements with the P.A. without any real oversight and without presenting any type of legislation. “It should require a change in the law,” he said. “Gantz is doing everything he can to undermine the law,” added Hirsch. “It is unbelievable how much damage Gantz is doing under the radar and completely without the general public actually knowing what he is doing.” Inbar agreed that Israel is actively supporting the P.A., because it is “afraid of the collapse of the P.A. that serves us well in the short term, sparing Israel the responsibility for managing the lives of the Palestinians.” Additionally, Inbar said, “Abbas exploits the leverage of weakness to get away with many things. Lending the P.A. money is a euphemism for financial support as the bankrupt P.A. has no intention or means to return any loan. Ganz is appropriating funds to the Palestinians, with questionable legal and/or political authority. Ganz is using the fragility of the coalition to pursue policies that are not consensual in the government or outside it.”

News article:
Defense Minister Benny Gantz on Monday pushed back against criticism of his recent meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, vowing to continue meeting with the PA leader. “I heard the criticism and again say, it’s the one who sends soldiers into battle who’s responsible for doing everything to prevent it,” Gantz said during a faction meeting of his Blue and White party. Gantz hosted Abbas at his home in Rosh Ha’ayin last week, the first time the PA leader met with a senior Israeli official inside Israel since 2010. It was also their second meeting since the new Israeli government was formed in June, with the first sit-down held in Ramallah. The meeting was strongly criticized by right-wing opposition parties and some hawkish members of the ruling coalition, which includes factions spanning the political spectrum and has clashed over various policy matters, including those pertaining to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “I was disappointed by cabinet ministers who preferred to speak from a political position at the expense of security needs. Behind closed doors, they sound different,” Gantz said. “For me, whenever the political interest runs into the security interest, security must always prevail.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Gantz said “the need to maintain Israel’s security” was the main focus of his meeting with Abbas, along with countering the Hamas terror group. “And this is the reason I will continue to meet with him and other elements in the region with whom discourse helps our stability, security and interests,” he said. The defense minister said he believed it was in the Palestinians’ interest “that calm create a healthy economy for them with a horizon for a better future.” Advertisement Gantz was also asked if he had sought approval from Prime Minister Naftali Bennett to meet with Abbas or had updated him about the meeting. “The prime minister was updated ahead of time,” Gantz said. “He can think as he thinks. I’m doing my job.” During a press conference Sunday, Bennett said he had given his “full approval” for last week’s meeting. “The defense minister spoke with me in advance and I didn’t see any reason to prohibit [the meeting], including the location,” he told reporters. The prime minister said Gantz and Abbas discussed security and economic matters — not political issues — and reiterated his opposition to personally meeting with the PA chief. Bennett is opposed to renewed peace negotiations with the Palestinians and has refused to meet with Abbas. Nevertheless, his government has pledged to prop up the Palestinian Authority and strengthen its ailing economy, with Gantz spearheading the move. Gantz has said he sees Abbas’s regime as the only alternative to an empowered Hamas in the West Bank. Gantz’s office announced several “confidence-building measures” following last week’s meeting. Advertisement These include approving the inclusion of 6,000 West Bank residents and 3,500 Gaza residents on a humanitarian basis in the PA’s resident registration; advancing the transfer of NIS 100 million ($32.2 million) in tax payments; and adding 600 BMC (businessman card) approvals for senior Palestinian businesspeople, as well as 500 permits for businesspeople with such approvals to enter Israel with their vehicles, and dozens of VIP permits for PA senior officials. Gantz and Abbas also discussed additional construction plans for Palestinian homes, the defense minister’s office said.

Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said Monday that he would have no problem meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas if the political conditions justified such talks. “It’s not on the agenda, but I won’t rule it out,” he said in a Zoom briefing with Israeli reporters. “There is no justification at this stage.” At the same time, such talks would not deal with a diplomatic solution between the Israelis and Palestinians, as the current government’s policy of not holding final-status negotiations with the PA will remain in place when he becomes prime minister in August 2023, he stressed. “I don’t think that five million Palestinians will disappear, but within the current political context, even after [I rotate in as prime minister], the coalition will be obligated to adhere to already reached agreements, and I will abide by every agreement that I made with my partners,” Lapid said, indicating that part of his agreement with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett upon forming a government was that neither of them would hold peace negotiations with the Palestinians.

Israeli Foreign Minister on Monday called for a diplomatic dialogue with the Palestinians, citing concerns that otherwise international organizations may designate Israel and apartheid state. In a press briefing, Lapid said the Diplomatic-Security Cabinet would soon convene to discuss a scenario in which the Palestinian Authority announced it was willing to start talks with Israel. Citing an “intelligence-based assessment,” he said that Israel should expect to see a significant increase in allegations from the Palestinians and their supporters that Israel was an apartheid state. If the situation were to deteriorate, Israeli sports and cultural institutions would be the first to be impacted, he said. Lapid noted the Foreign Ministry would focus a large part of its efforts on contending with such anti-Israel campaigns in the new year. Foreign Ministry Director-General Alon Ushpiz told reporters: “In the coming year, we expect to see resolutions and processes with the potential to cause significant damage, and there is real danger an official U.N. body will determine Israel is an apartheid state.”

News article:
Foreign Minister Yair Lapid reportedly met with Palestinian Authority General Intelligence chief Majed Faraj late last month as some members of the new government continue to expand their contacts with the PA leadership. According to Hebrew media reports on Wednesday, the two discussed economic and security matters, namely the security coordination between Jerusalem and Ramallah, which has long been credited for maintaining relative calm in the West Bank. Lapid and Faraj did not discuss diplomatic affairs, Haaretz reported, citing Israeli sources. This has become a main talking point from Jerusalem after meetings with PA officials in recent months, given Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s opposition to Palestinian statehood. However, PA readouts from such sit-downs, including last month’s meeting between PA President Mahmoud Abbas and Defense Minister Benny Gantz, insist that the sides discussed building a horizon to end the conflict. Lapid said last week that he would have no problem meeting with Abbas if the political conditions justified such talks when he becomes prime minister under the rotation agreement in August 2023. “It’s not on the agenda, but I won’t rule it out,” he said in a Zoom briefing with Israeli reporters. “There is no justification at this stage.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms At the same time, such talks would not deal with a diplomatic solution between the Israelis and Palestinians, as the current government’s policy of not holding final-status negotiations with the PA will remain in place, he stressed. “I don’t think that five million Palestinians will disappear, but within the current political context, even after [I rotate in as prime minister], the coalition will be obligated to adhere to already reached agreements, and I will abide by every agreement that I made with my partners,” Lapid said, indicating that part of his agreement with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett upon forming a government was that neither of them would hold peace negotiations with the Palestinians.

Lapid and Faraj did not discuss diplomatic affairs, Haaretz reported, citing Israeli sources. This has become a main talking point from Jerusalem after meetings with PA officials in recent months, given Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s opposition to Palestinian statehood. However, PA readouts from such sit-downs, including last month’s meeting between PA President Mahmoud Abbas and Defense Minister Benny Gantz, insist that the sides discussed building a horizon to end the conflict. Lapid said last week that he would have no problem meeting with Abbas if the political conditions justified such talks when he becomes prime minister under the rotation agreement in August 2023. “It’s not on the agenda, but I won’t rule it out,” he said in a Zoom briefing with Israeli reporters. “There is no justification at this stage.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms At the same time, such talks would not deal with a diplomatic solution between the Israelis and Palestinians, as the current government’s policy of not holding final-status negotiations with the PA will remain in place, he stressed. “I don’t think that five million Palestinians will disappear, but within the current political context, even after [I rotate in as prime minister], the coalition will be obligated to adhere to already reached agreements, and I will abide by every agreement that I made with my partners,” Lapid said, indicating that part of his agreement with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett upon forming a government was that neither of them would hold peace negotiations with the Palestinians. The focus of the government in its ongoing contacts with PA officials revolves around security cooperation, improving the daily lives of Palestinians, and strengthening the Palestinian economy, he said. Advertisement The government is committed to not doing anything to torpedo the chances for diplomatic talks with the PA in the future, Lapid explained. Lapid’s comments came as Gantz pushed back against criticism of his recent meeting with Abbas, vowing to continue meeting with the PA leader. Gantz hosted Abbas at his home in Rosh Ha’ayin last month, the first time the PA leader met with a senior Israeli official inside Israel since 2010. It was also their second meeting since the new Israeli government was formed in June, with the first sit-down held in Ramallah. The meeting was strongly criticized by right-wing opposition parties and some hawkish members of the ruling coalition, which includes factions spanning the political spectrum, and has clashed over various policy matters, including those pertaining to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Bennett said he had given his “full approval” for Gantz’s meeting. “The defense minister spoke with me in advance and I didn’t see any reason to prohibit [the meeting], including the location,” he told reporters. Bennett is opposed to renewed peace negotiations with the Palestinians and has refused to meet with Abbas. Nevertheless, his government has pledged to prop up the Palestinian Authority and strengthen its ailing economy, with Gantz spearheading the move. Gantz has said that he sees Abbas’s regime as the only alternative to an empowered Hamas in the West Bank. Advertisement Gantz’s office announced several “confidence-building measures” following the meeting. These include approving the inclusion of 6,000 West Bank residents and 3,500 Gaza residents on a humanitarian basis in the PA’s resident registration; advancing the transfer of NIS 100 million ($32.2 million) in tax payments; and adding 600 BMC (businessman card) approvals for senior Palestinian businesspeople, as well as 500 permits for businesspeople, with such approvals to enter Israel with their vehicles, and dozens of VIP permits for PA senior officials.

News article:
Amid the segments of Israeli society that are widely known dwells a smaller population that ostensibly looks and acts like everyone else — its members pay taxes and serve in the defense of the country. They are excluded from key aspects of Israeli society, however, in an “othering” of people that has to end. The State of Israel is home to many citizens who think of themselves as Jews, but who are not considered Jewish by Jewish law (halakhah), and therefore have always officially been designated “Other” by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Specifically, the vast majority of this demographic are born to a Jewish father, but not to a Jewish mother. Of course, Arab and Druze Israelis have their own proud identities, but this population is not Arab or Druze either. Indeed, its members too often fall between the cracks. The question of how to relate to those who have Jewish ancestry and want to be part of the People of Israel, when they are not halakhically Jewish, is not a new one. In the 16th century, Rabbi Moshe Isserles, a major figure in the world of Jewish law, speculated whether a son born to a gentile mother and a Jewish father could be considered “rabbinically Jewish,” even though the rabbis thought such a person was not Jewish according to the Torah itself. More recently, Rabbi Benzion Uziel, the first Sephardi chief rabbi of the State of Israel, maintained that those who were Jewish only by “patrilineal descent” should be accepted for a streamlined process of conversion, basically fast-tracking them to join Israeli Jewish society as full-fledged members. In the current era, many Israeli immigrants from the former Soviet Union were born to Jewish fathers and non-Jewish mothers. In their countries of origin, they identified and were identified as Jews, and not always in a good way. Many only discovered that they were not considered fully Jewish upon arrival to Israel. Contrary to popular opinion, the majority of this population did not come to Israel purely for economic reasons. Many had other options, whether in Germany, Canada, or other places that welcome Jews from the former Soviet Union. They came to Israel because they felt the pull of the Jewish state, just as millions of others have since its establishment. Because of their strong Jewish identity, we need to find language that embraces and incorporates these people, and which makes them realize that Israel includes them in the Jewish nation, even if they are not, before formal conversion, fully recognized as Jewish. They are our partners, and we should use positive and inclusive language rather than the language of exclusion. I am therefore delighted that the CBS has said that, upon my request, it will end the use of the term that has been in use for this population, “Other,” and create a new category of “Extended Jewish Population.” As a Jewish state, we naturally want the identity of these people to be bound up with our national identity. We also must look to the future. The last great reservoir of potential aliyah is from North America. In the event that increasing numbers of North Americans ever seek to make aliyah, Israel will surely see an influx of those who are intermarried, or are the children of intermarriage. As statistics make abundantly clear, the majority of Jews today and the overwhelming majority of Jews in the future, will not marry other Jews. While we hope that Jewish communities will continue to flourish around the world, Israel will always keep its gates open for aliyah, and that means we need to face this reality of intermarriage, and be more inclusive, so the non-Jewish partners and children of these marriages feel a part of the Jewish state. Perhaps the steps we are taking now in Israel will open a new discussion on this issue in the Diaspora. Advertisement As an Orthodox Jew, I am strongly in favor of Jewish intra-marriage, but as a politician, it is my job to find solutions to challenges — and not ignore them in the hope that they will go away. We want to help anyone who seeks to convert, but even if those of patrilineal descent do not want to do so, we must make them feel that they have a connection to the national majority and foundational pillars of our Jewish and democratic state. We want them to feel pride in our national flag with its Star of David and the azure blue stripes, in the national symbol of the menorah, and the national anthem that talks of “the Jewish soul.” We absolutely must find a solution for those who are not Jewish, as defined by Jewish law, and yet are eligible to make aliyah under the Law of Return. For this to happen, we must employ different language that makes those of patrilineal descent feel like the extended family of the rest of the Jewish people. They are our friends, our IDF comrades, our colleagues, and people we see every day. They make up around five percent of the population and contribute in every field towards the development, progress and flourishment of our nation. Changing these people’s designation from “Other” to “Extended Jewish Population” in the Central Bureau of Statistics is the necessary first step toward increasing their feelings of inclusion.

News article:
Clashes between Israelis and Palestinians are nothing new. These episodes have been happening since the Zionist militias started the Nakba in 1948 with the violent expulsion of more than 750,000 Palestinians and the destruction of more than 140 towns and villages. This ethnic cleansing campaign made way for the Ashkenazi, Khazar and Sephardi Jews, displaced from Europe, to settle in historical Palestine. The episodes of direct confrontations in May 2021 between Palestinian resistance forces and Israel reignited the debate on the legitimacy of each and the effectiveness of a lasting peace agreement between the two parties. As usual, the mainstream media lavishly trumpeted the chant about "Israel's right to defend itself", while continuing to treat resistance forces, especially the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, as responsible for aggression and "terrorism". In January 2020, former US President Donald Trump, without the participation of Palestinians, announced an arrangement termed the "deal of the century". Trump's proposition was a unilateral initiative arising from pressure from the US Jewish lobby aimed at continuing the annexations of Palestinian territories and recognising and legalising the crimes that the Jewish state has been committing since 1948. What appeared to be an alternative to "lasting peace" was, in fact, a macabre plan to end Palestine as a nation. The colonialist plan did not end after the self-proclamation of the Jewish state nor with the massacre perpetrated during the so-called Six-Day War, or with the occupation of the Gaza Strip, Sinai (Egypt) and the Golan Heights (Syria). Israel continues to carry out the process of complete Judaisation of Palestine in all fields, adopting legislation such as the Basic Law of the Nation-State passed by the Knesset on 19 July, 2018, through which it legally became an exclusive state for Jews. As can be seen, the goal of the Israeli occupation is the complete destruction of Palestine so that there is finally the establishment of a state of Jewish supremacy in the occupied territories, without defined borders and in permanent expansion. The intention is to transform what is left of Palestine into small islands of land as if it were a mini-state – pulverised, surrounded and suffocated by the occupier on all sides. A new Hamas programme was approved in 2017 and called the General Document of Principles and Policies. It asserts that the establishment of the so-called "State of Israel" based on unilateral decisions is completely "illegal, infringes the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, and goes against their will and the will of the Nation,"[1] as it is a violation of human rights and the right to self-determination. Hamas has declared that it will not recognise Israel or anything that happened in Palestine in terms of occupation. This includes the construction of colonial settlements, the Judaisation of historical and sacred places and the change in characteristics or falsification of historical and cultural facts. It understands that Palestinian rights over their land and places will never lapse. The Hamas programme rejects a lasting solution other than the liberation of Palestine "from the river to the sea", without compromising its rejection of Israel and without abandoning any rights of the Palestinians. It agrees with the establishment of a Palestinian state along the borders of 4 June, 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital and the return of refugees and displaced people from their homes, from which they have been expelled since 1948. The leadership of Hamas has declared that it is committed to the re-establishment of relations and joint actions by Palestinian organisations based on pluralism, democracy, national partnership, acceptance of the other and the adoption of dialogue. The aim is to strengthen the unity to meet the aspirational needs of the Palestinian people, as occurred in the historic meeting of 5 September, 2020, when the main Palestinian forces came together for a joint initiative to contest the Israeli occupation. Some insist on the thesis of the alleged attempt by Hamas to delegitimise the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). However, the movement shows the recognition of the organisation in its programme, stating that it is a reference for the Palestinian people that needs to be preserved, developed and rebuilt on a democratic basis, inside and outside Palestine, to ensure the participation of all forces fighting to protect the rights of Palestinians. While Palestinians seek solutions to end the colonial apartheid of the "Jewish state", Zionist leaders deny, by all means, the most elementary rights of Palestinians. This can be seen in the statements of the current premier, Naftali Bennett, who said in 2018 that he "wouldn't give an inch of land to the Arabs" and told US magazine The New Yorker in 2013: "I will do everything in my power so that they never have their own state." For these and other reasons, Palestinians do not trust the Zionists. They do not comply with agreements, such as the Oslo Accords, which have become a dead letter without recognising the right of existence of the Palestinian state. After Oslo, Israel accelerated the expansion of the occupation, the creation of Jewish colonial settlements, the confiscation of land, the creation of quotas for exports to the Israeli market and control on the import of agricultural machinery and tools, which ended up ruining Palestinian agriculture. Despite this, there are still those who advocate the recognition of Israel by the Palestinian resistance as a pre-condition for the existence of "lasting peace agreements". There are also those who support normalisation to take effect when it is known that this arrangement is ineffective for the simple realisation that Israel will not stop the occupation at a negotiating table. Such rhetoric serves the interests of the Israeli occupation, which is aware of its inability to win new battles against the Palestinian resistance. To accept the occupier's reality is to annihilate the dream of freedom and liberation, betraying the martyrs and those who fought long and hard for freedom, self-determination and dignity. This would betray the principles of legitimate resistance to achieve what is enshrined in international law and the Charter of the United Nations. [1]TENÓRIO, Sayid Marcos.

News article:
This week, the Fatah movement confirmed its ongoing dissociation from the people of Palestine and their occupied land when it "unanimously reasserted its confidence in President Mahmoud Abbas" in all his roles. Abbas is the head of Fatah, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the so-called President of the Palestinian Authority, the latter without a legitimate mandate. Fatah's delusions are a far cry from ordinary Palestinians calling upon Abbas to step down in the aftermath of the extrajudicial killing of activist Nizar Banat by the PA's security services last year. Unfortunately, Abbas has enough allies able to drown Palestinian voices politically. It is not that Palestinians do not have a voice, but the international community has already defined Palestine through the hypothetical two-state compromise with the PLO as the people's "sole representative"; Israel defines Palestine through elimination; and Abbas has been supportive of both stances. So what, exactly, is Fatah supporting when it "unanimously" proclaims confidence in its leader? His latest steps, as contradictory as ever, spell out an even greater capitulation to Israel. Since Banat's killing, when Palestinians asserted their dissent and opposition to Abbas openly, he has realised that he stands no chance against the people. In typical authoritarian fashion, therefore, he turned to Israel and the US for help. That was, sadly, entirely in character and a logical move, given that the PA has lost the trust of Palestinians completely. Abbas's meetings with Israel's Defence Minister Benny Gantz have allowed the PA to cling to what remains of its power. The only reason that the gimmicky talks succeeded was because the Palestinians have been subjected to decades of deprivation. In the same manner that humanitarian aid takes priority in the absence of political rights, the Palestinian leadership gets away with spinning symbolic concessions as political agreements. READ: A diplomat without an ideology? The US ambassador's words suggest otherwise Abbas made headline news last year by threatening Israel with a deadline to end the military occupation within a year. More concerning, though, was his capitulation to the occupation state by deciding to stop the collection of evidence about Israel's war crimes to submit to the International Criminal Court. This is no surprise, even though it reeks of exploitation of the Palestinian people. Not only is Abbas against the Palestinian people having political rights, but he is also opposed to the slightest, albeit belated, chance of them seeing justice in respect of the very obvious war crimes committed against them. Abbas has done this in return for symbolic concessions from Gantz and a hostile Israeli government that excels in ridiculing the Palestinian leadership. The latter appears not to bother Abbas at all as long as he can continue to fill his coffers for which he has established himself as a colonial collaborator accountable to nobody except Israel, the US and the international community. Fatah has limited the scope of defining Palestine through its ludicrous, although strategic, endorsement of Abbas. Of course the movement has full confidence that Abbas will continue to help Israel to colonise Palestine, of that there is no doubt, not even among the Palestinian people. That is why he is there, and why the PA and its security services were created by Oslo in the first place. However, Palestine is much more than Abbas. It is a land with tenacious people who are not going anywhere and will continue to struggle for their legitimate rights. They do not deserve a leader like Abbas, but they have to live with his shabby legacy. A major part of the Palestinian struggle must now entail wresting away the definition of Palestine as a target for elimination. That will provide the Palestinians with a unanimous, collective effort against Abbas and Fatah hypocrisy.

News article:
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh says Israel’s rejection of the “creation” of a Palestinian state is an incitement to more violence in the occupied territories. On January 28, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett provocatively said he would not allow any talks leading to the establishment of a Palestinian state. “If there were talks with the Palestinians, there would be no government. I reject the creation of a Palestinian state. I will never allow political talks on the borders to be held,” the right-wing premier said. On Monday and at the start of the weekly Palestinian cabinet meeting held in Ramallah, Shtayyeh hit back. He said such statements from the Israeli premier “prove to us and to the world the scale of extremism of” this occupying regime “and its positions hostile to peace and political negotiations with the Palestinians, as well as its rejection and the denial of the signed agreements.” The Palestinian prime minister, whose remarks were carried by Palestine's official Wafa news agency, also said Israel’s statements and positions as well as actions “prove the validity of what we said that there is no partner on the Israeli side for peacemaking,” and that the current Israeli cabinet “is systematically destroying the possibility of establishing the State of Palestine.” Elsewhere in his remarks, Shtayyeh called on the United States and the European Union (EU) to intervene and halt Israel’s plans in occupied East al-Quds, the capital of the future Palestinian state, which are aimed at occupying most of its land for the regime’s settlement expansion. The Palestinian premier also noted that the Tel Aviv regime persists in demolishing Palestinian-owned homes in East al-Quds and displacing their residents, while many more houses and residential buildings are under the threat of demolition and their owners risk displacement. Also on January 28, member of the Hamas political bureau Ezzat Al-Rishq condemned Bennett’s provocative remarks, saying that such statements are a slap to those who keep faith in negotiations with the Israeli occupation. The Hamas official stressed that the Palestinian state could be established through resistance and steadfastness. Al-Rishq said that Bennett’s comments only “reveals the reality of our enemy and his war on our people. It proves that those who run after an occupation-given Palestinian state are just chasing after a mirage.” More than 600,000 Israelis live in over 230 settlements built since the 1967 Israeli occupation of the West Bank and East al-Quds. All the settlements are illegal under international law as they are built on occupied land. The United Nations Security Council has condemned Israel’s settlement activities in the occupied territories in several resolutions.

It proves that those who run after an occupation-given Palestinian state are just chasing after a mirage.” More than 600,000 Israelis live in over 230 settlements built since the 1967 Israeli occupation of the West Bank and East al-Quds. All the settlements are illegal under international law as they are built on occupied land. The United Nations Security Council has condemned Israel’s settlement activities in the occupied territories in several resolutions.

News article:
A key state’s witness in Opposition Leader Benjamin Netanyahu’s trial testified Tuesday that the former prime minister actively pushed for the establishment of a free tabloid in order to blunt Israel’s biggest-selling newspaper, which he considered hostile to him. Nir Hefetz, a former Netanyahu confidant, told the Jerusalem District Court that the ex-premier helped enlist the late Jewish-American casino magnate Sheldon Adelson to set up Israel Hayom. “Benjamin Netanyahu was involved in recruiting Sheldon Adelson to establish a paper that would take down Yedioth Ahronoth,” Hefetz said from the stand. “Netanyahu’s claims that [Yedioth publisher Arnon] Mozes was exploiting him are hypocrisy.” Hefetz is the state’s key witness in the trial against Netanyahu, who faces charges in three separate graft cases. In the so-called Case 2000, he is accused of attempting to make a deal with Mozes for softer coverage of him in Yedioth, exchange for legislation to curb Israel Hayom’s reach. Mozes also faces charges in the case. Israel Hayom, a right-wing newspaper widely considered to be a mouthpiece for Netanyahu, started operating in 2007 under Adelson, who died earlier this year. It quickly overtook Yedioth Ahronoth in circulation, thanks to its aggressive dissemination and free distribution. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Hefetz told the court there were times when Netanyahu demanded that Israel Hayom go after Mozes. “I was witness to conversations in which Netanyahu demanded that Israel Hayom go full force after [Arnon] Mozes personally,” Hefetz said under cross-examination. He alleged Netanyahu threatened Mozes by saying that he had “personal information” about him, but was never privy to what information the former prime minister supposedly had. Advertisement Hefetz also recalled being told by Natan Eshel, once the bureau chief at the Prime Minister’s Office, that he had been dispatched by Netanyahu to warn Mozes ahead of Israel Hayom’s establishment. “He warned him that if [Yedioth] doesn’t stop being a hostile newspaper toward Netanyahu, this thing owned by Sheldon will be set up and eliminate Yedioth,” Hefetz testified. According to Hefetz, Eshel warned Mozes that Israel Hayom would begin printing “if this newspaper doesn’t get in line.” He said Adelson would also make threats against Mozes, including personal ones. “The personal threats were nonsense. The real threat was to smash the Yedioth Ahronoth group, to bring it down,” Hefetz said of Netanyahu’s alleged comments. He also said there was no economic logic in founding Israel Hayom and that “it was likely established for an ideological reason.” Advertisement “This newspaper loses tens of millions a year in a best-case scenario, and it is given out free to unequivocally destroy what Arnon Moses sees not only as his life’s work, but almost as his entire being,” Hefetz said. Regarding Yedioth, Hefetz argued the newspaper had no clear agenda beyond maintaining as large a readership as possible. During questioning by Mozes’s defense attorney, Hefetz said the Yedioth publisher never asked him to relay messages to Netanyahu, and that it was the former premier who initiated contacts. “[Mozes] told me that he doesn’t believe a word of [Netanyahu’s],” he said. The cross-examination of Hefetz was expected to wrap up on Wednesday. During Monday testimony, Hefetz detailed the animosity between Netanyahu and Mozes, saying the former premier viewed the Yedioth publisher as “his true opposition.” Netanyahu faces charges of fraud and breach of trust in Case 1000 and in Case 2000, and charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in Case 4000. In Case 4000, the most serious against the former premier, he is alleged to have worked to illicitly and lucratively benefit the business interests of controlling shareholder of the Bezeq media company Shaul Elovitch in exchange for positive coverage on the Walla news site owned by Elovitch. Advertisement In Case 1000, he is accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of gifts from two billionaires — Hollywood-based Israeli movie mogul Arnon Milchan and Australian magnate James Packer. Netanyahu denies all allegations against him, and says the charges were fabricated by a biased police force and state prosecution service, overseen by a weak attorney general, in league with political opponents and the media.

After more than five weeks and 17 hearings, a former close confidant of Benjamin Netanyahu ended his testimony Wednesday in the corruption trial against the ex-prime minister, capping key testimony by the state witness that could make or break the prosecution’s case. Wednesday’s hearing at the Jerusalem District Court ended the cross-examination of Nir Hefetz, who said afterward it had been exceptionally difficult for him to testify against his former boss. “I feel relief after five weeks on the podium, in front of a series of the most senior lawyers in the country,” Hefetz told reporters. “This is it. I hope I have managed to bring my humble angle to the pursuit of the truth.” “It was an almost impossible ordeal to stand in such a trial against Netanyahu,” he said. “It was very difficult mentally and emotionally. I only went with the truth. I hope I’m saying goodbye to the security guards for the rest of my life.” Hefetz added that after breaking four years of silence on the matter, he still preferred not to discuss the content of his testimony publicly.

Former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been ordered to return some 30 gifts given to him during his 12-year term as premier, as they rightfully belong to the State of Israel. But during a recent sitdown with the Prime Minister’s Office legal adviser, Shlomit Barnea Farago, Netanyahu’s lawyers said they could not return the gifts because “some were broken and some were lost.” Channel 13 news reported Thursday that Barnea Farago was apparently not convinced by the lawyer’s explanations, and she is expected to notify Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who will then decide whether or not to probe the matter. “The lawyers presented a detailed account, according to which some of the gifts were found, others were lost or broken years ago, and others were taken by staff at the Prime Minister’s Office, during a major renovation of the office,” according to a statement issued on behalf of Netanyahu. Earlier this month, a good governance group pressed Mandelblit to open a probe into the whereabouts of the gifts. “On the face of it, and as long as the gifts are not in the possession of the Netanyahu family, there is a fear that the gifts were stolen from the prime minister’s residence, or transferred to the possession of those who are not authorized to hold them,” the Movement for Quality Government wrote.

News article:
Opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu has been holding talks with a publishing house about releasing a new book, after failing to return the advance for a previous work that was shelved, a newspaper report said Monday. According to the Haaretz daily, the book Netanyahu is discussing with Yedioth Books would include autobiographical details, and, along with an Israeli release, would also likely be published in English for an overseas audience. Yedioth Books is a division of the Yedioth Ahronoth Group, whose publisher, Arnon Mozes, has notoriously acrimonious ties with Netanyahu. Despite their frosty relationship, the two have been indicted for allegedly trying to reach a quid pro quo in which Netanyahu would have received positive media coverage from the Yedioth Ahronoth daily, in exchange for legislation weakening rival newspaper Israel Hayom. Both deny wrongdoing in the case, one of three corruption probes that Netanyahu is currently standing trial for. The former prime minister has published books through Yedioth in the past, and was set to release another he wrote when serving as finance minister from 2003-2005 and during an earlier stint as opposition leader, before he reclaimed the premiership in 2009. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Dov Eichenwald, the CEO of Yedioth Books, told investigators in 2017 that the planned publication of the book was frozen upon Netanyahu’s return to the Prime Minister’s Office, attributing the move to Netanyahu not wanting to highlight the policies he pushed when serving as finance minister. “He adopted a very tough and cruel economic policy…. When he was elected prime minister, to present this in a book… is very uncomfortable,” Eichenwald said at the time, according to Haaretz. Though the book was shelved, Netanyahu never returned the advance, which Eichenwald estimated was worth NIS 140,000 ($45,000). Advertisement “I told him, ‘You know what, do a biography for us after you are done as prime minister,” Eichenwald was quoted as saying. “I met with him and told him, ‘Listen, every Sunday, for about half an hour, write down your impressions.'” However, Eichenwald said Netanyahu never formally committed to releasing a biography with Yedioth, leading him to approach David Shimron, the ex-premier’s lawyer and cousin, about getting the advance back. According to Eichenwald, Shimron told him he would try to find another publisher to purchase the rights to the book, though no buyer was found and the advance was not returned. Neither Eichenwald nor Netanyahu responded to the newspaper’s request for comment. The report also said that in addition to his talks with Yedioth, Netanyahu was considering publishing the new book independently. It noted that he could also decide to release the previously shelved book through Yedioth or return the advance. In September, the Walla news site reported that Netanyahu had been working on a new book about his time in office and worldview. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, authored several books in the 1980s and 1990s. Advertisement He has remained active in politics since losing power when the new government took office in June, and now, as opposition leader, is vowing to unseat the Naftali Bennett-led coalition that ousted him. He also continues to stand trial on the corruption charges, which he denies.

News article:
Prosecutors are reportedly fuming over reports that former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been holding secret talks with the attorney general over a plea deal in his corruption trial, which is now said to be just awaiting Netanyahu’s final approval. Meanwhile, political forces believe a plea deal that removes Netanyahu from the political sphere could cause the speedy collapse of the current, ideologically splintered governing coalition. Netanyahu, the opposition leader, is on trial in three separate graft cases, after being indicted in 2019 for fraud, breach of trust and bribery. News broke earlier this week that the former prime minister was conducting secret negotiations with Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit over a potential plea deal. While initial reports indicated that the negotiations had hit a dead end, TV networks reported on Thursday that the two sides are very close to signing a deal, although one major sticking point remains. According to Channel 13 news, prosecutors will only agree to a deal that includes an admission of moral turpitude and community service for Netanyahu. If his actions are found to have carried moral turpitude, a guilty plea would bar Netanyahu from public service for seven years, likely ending the 72-year-old’s political career for good. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The secret talks were reportedly initiated by Netanyahu’s attorney Boaz Ben Zur, and state prosecutors made clear that there would be no compromise on the conviction of moral turpitude. Channel 13 indicated Thursday night that the state prosecution’s insistence on the moral turpitude designation was the key sticking point preventing a deal. According to a Thursday night report on Channel 12, however, the side were at odds only over the question of when Netanyahu would resign from the Knesset, and therefore who would have the authority to determine if the charges amount to moral turpitude. Advertisement If he resigns before a final verdict, it would fall to the Supreme Court judge who heads the Central Elections Committee to make a decision before the next election to the Knesset. If, however, Netanyahu remains in office until a verdict is in place — Mandelblit’s purported preference — then the judges will make the ultimate decision on whether his actions amount to moral turpitude. It was not immediately clear why this was a significant issue, however, since the same TV report indicated that in both scenarios, the crimes would likely be designated as constituting moral turpitude. Netanyahu — who has long publicly proclaimed that his innocence would be proven in court, and previously vowed not to accept any plea deal — is reportedly consulting with aides about moving forward with a deal. Reports have indicated that Mandelblit may be eager to wrap things up before his term ends at the end of the month. Channel 12 news noted that it is possible Netanyahu is not really interested in a plea deal at all, and may simply be trying to depict the cases publicly as weak, pointing to the prosecution’s readiness to compromise. According to Channel 13, Netanyahu started considering a plea deal after receiving a legal assessment that key state’s witness Nir Hefetz’s recent testimony was effective for the prosecution’s case, and amid concerns that the upcoming testimony of another state’s witness, Shlomo Filber, could also be damaging. Top state prosecution officials were unaware of the negotiations for a plea deal with Netanyahu until Wednesday, Channel 13 reported. According to the TV network, Mandelblit held the talks secretly and only notified top figures tied to the case on Wednesday. Officials were outraged when they found out, the report said. Netanyahu faces charges in three separate graft cases: fraud and breach of trust in Case 1000 and in Case 2000, and charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in Case 4000. Advertisement In Case 4000, the most serious against the former premier, he is alleged to have worked to illicitly and lucratively benefit the business interests of controlling shareholder of the Bezeq media company Shaul Elovitch in exchange for positive coverage on the Walla news site, owned by Elovitch. In Case 1000, he is accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of gifts from two billionaires — Hollywood-based Israeli movie mogul Arnon Milchan and Australian magnate James Packer. In Case 2000, he is accused of attempting to make a deal with Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper publisher Arnon Mozes for softer coverage of him in exchange for legislation to curb the reach of rival daily Israel Hayom. According to the TV networks, the details of the plea agreement that have already been agreed to would include dropping the bribery charge in Case 4000, as well as the entire Case 2000, and seeing Netanyahu admit to fraud and breach of trust in both Cases 4000 and 1000. The sides have reportedly agreed that Netanyahu will not see prison time, and would be sentenced to three to six months of community service. Some officials in the prosecution do not want to close Case 2000 against the premier, Channel 13 reported. Either way, analysts have noted, the Supreme Court justices are not a rubber stamp for plea deals, and would have to sign off on the details of the agreement before it can be finalized — and could potentially reject it. Meanwhile, political analysts and insiders have already been assessing the potential fallout of such a deal. If Netanyahu’s political career is effectively over, many observers believe it would spell the end of the current government coalition. With Netanyahu out as head of Likud, the coalition’s right-wing parties — which refused to sit together with Likud only as long as Netanyahu headed it — are likely to jump ship and easily form a right-wing government. Advertisement Channel 12 noted that it is possible Netanyahu could stay on as chairman of Likud even if he is no longer a member of Knesset — similar to Shas leader Aryeh Deri, who recently signed his own plea deal on tax offenses. But sources in Likud have said privately that they would oppose Netanyahu attempting to stay on as leader of the party after he resigns. And many in the party are now ramping up the quiet and not-so quiet preparations for the future of the party in the post-Netanyahu era.

Channel 13 reports that top state prosecution officials were not aware of the negotiations for a plea deal with Benjamin Netanyahu until yesterday. The report says Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit held the talks secretly and only notified top figures tied to the case yesterday. Officials were outraged by the matter, it adds. Some officials in the prosecution do not want to agree to close Case 2000 against the premier, the network says — closing the case has been reported as one of the offers under the proposed deal. Channel 13 says prosecutors will only agree to a deal that includes an admission of moral turpitude and community service for Netanyahu. If his actions are found to have carried moral turpitude, it would mean Netanyahu would be barred from public life for seven years, likely ending the 72-year-old’s political career.

Channel 12’s Guy Peleg notes that Netanyahu may not be interested in a plea deal at all, and may simply be trying to depict the cases publicly as weak, hence the prosecution’s readiness to compromise. He also notes that courts are not a rubber stamp for plea bargains, and could feasibly reject one even if the sides agree to it. Channel 13 also cites an unnamed senior official in the government saying that if a deal is signed, it will present “an immediate danger to the stability of the coalition.” This is because if Netanyahu departs politics as part of a plea deal, it will be much easier for the right to form a coalition with Likud.

Former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu attempted to reach a plea deal in his three criminal cases some two years ago, The Times of Israel’s Hebrew sister-site Zman Yisrael reported Friday, but the proposal was vetoed by Netanyahu’s wife Sara. According to the report, the offer discussed between a top Netanyahu attorney and Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit at the start of 2020 was very similar to the one the sides are now reported to be negotiating: Bribery charges would be removed from the indictment against Netanyahu and he would admit to charges of fraud and breach of trust. In return, he would then receive a mild sentence of community service and be convicted of “moral turpitude” — ejecting him from public life for at least seven years and likely ending his political career. According to Zman Yisrael, Sara Netanyahu rejected the proposal out of hand.

News article:
In excerpts from a book he wrote in the early 2000s but never published, former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu calls corruption “a cancer that grows in the dark” The excerpts were published on Friday by the Haaretz newspaper, which did not say exactly when the book, “The Israeli Leopard,” was written, though it was done somewhere between the end of his stint as finance minister in 2005 and his reelection as prime minister in 2009. Netanyahu, now leader of the opposition, evidently decided to freeze it when he returned to the Prime Minister’s Office in 2009. The quotes, which rail against corruption, bloated governments and the dangers of over-concentration of centralized power, are especially relevant as Netanyahu is currently on trial in three corruption cases, after being indicted in 2019 for fraud, breach of trust and bribery — largely revolving around his alleged efforts to secure better media coverage as he tried to maintain power during his decade-long stint as prime minister. He is now reported to be nearing a plea bargain. The book dealt mostly with his actions as finance minister in 2003-2005, and in it, he detailed his neo-liberal agenda and worldview, but also touched on corruption. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “Corruption is like cancer that grows in the darkness. It distorts competition, hurts citizens’ morale, and discourages them because it signals that the path to material progress is not dependent on effort and talent, but on bribery,” Netanyahu wrote. “In Israel, corruption bubbles up from a single source: concentration of power. For years immense financial power has been concentrated in the government, the labor federation and the parties,” wrote Netanyahu who played a key role in liberalizing Israel’s economy. “A hundred years ago Lord Acton warned against the corrupting effect of absolute power. The way to prevent corruption in the political system is to decentralize or limit the government’s economic power,” he said. Advertisement He also railed against moguls who monopolize the Israeli economy. “There are moguls who have become accustomed to a ‘regulated’ market, meaning a private sector working in large monopolies and duopolies whose heads enjoy government sponsorship and are protected by politicians,” he said. Later has was charged with colluding with one. In Case 4000, the most serious against the former premier, he is alleged to have worked to illicitly and lucratively benefit the business interests of controlling shareholder of the Bezeq media company Shaul Elovitch in exchange for positive coverage on the Walla news site, owned by Elovitch. In Case 2000, he is accused of attempting to make a deal with Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper publisher Arnon Mozes for softer coverage of him in exchange for legislation to curb the reach of rival daily Israel Hayom. In Case 1000, he is accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts from two billionaires — Hollywood-based Israeli movie mogul Arnon Milchan and Australian magnate James Packer. Advertisement The publication of the excerpts comes amid a series of reports that Netanyahu is currently trying to negotiate a plea deal with Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit. Netanyahu — who has long publicly proclaimed that his innocence would be proven in court, and previously vowed not to accept any plea deal — is reportedly consulting with aides about moving forward with a deal. Reports have indicated that Mandelblit may be eager to wrap things up before his term ends at the end of the month. The book also contains advice on maintaining a small government that Netanyahu himself quickly jettisoned on becoming prime minister again. “A government of 18 ministers is too big for the management of a small country, and in fact any country. The truth must be said: Most government ministries are bloated far beyond their desirable size. Any person who has worked one day in a ministry knows this.” During his terms in officer Netanyahu frequently oversaw governments with many more ministers and deputy ministers as he doled out positions and even set up new ministries in a bid to appease his coalition partners. According to reports, the details of the plea agreement that have already been agreed to would include dropping the bribery charge in Case 4000, as well as the entire Case 2000, and seeing Netanyahu admit to fraud and breach of trust in both Cases 4000 and 1000. The sides have reportedly agreed that Netanyahu will not see prison time, and would be sentenced to three to six months of community service. The main sticking point said to be that prosecutors will only agree to a deal that includes an admission of moral turpitude, which would see him barred from office for seven years. Netanyahu is said to be trying to avoid the moral turpitude designation in order to have a chance at returning to politics.

News article:
Former Supreme Court president Aharon Barak acknowledged Saturday that opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu had asked him to speak with Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit about the possibility of reaching a plea deal in the former premier’s graft trial. “I won’t deny that when I reached out to Mandelblit, Benjamin Netanyahu’s contribution to the country was always on my mind. He was one of the greatest defenders of the Israeli justice system, until his trial,” Barak told the Ynet news site. Barak said that in recent months, senior figures in Netanyahu’s Likud party asked him to initiate talks with Mandelblit. “I asked them if Netanyahu sent them, they denied it,” he said. “I recently received a personal appeal from Netanyahu, and I decided not to remain indifferent.” According to Channel 12 news, Barak had refused to speak to Mandelblit on Netanyahu’s behalf so long as the appeal did not come from the former premier himself. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Barak stressed that any plea deal must include a clause that Netanyahu will be convicted of “moral turpitude” — a legal designation which would bar him from public office for seven years. According to the Walla news site, Netanyahu reached out to Barak at least three times via emissaries since 2019, to convince him to speak with Mandelblit regarding his corruption cases. The most recent attempt occurred several weeks ago, when Netanyahu sent attorney Michael Ravilo to convince Barak, according to Hebrew-language media reports. Advertisement Channel 12 news on Saturday night cited supposed statements by Barak, in which he said Netanyahu’s trial was “a special case that requires a [plea] deal, for the sake of healing the rifts in the nation and reducing the level of pressure on the justice system.” “I will publicly support the [plea] deal when it is signed,” he was quoted by the network as saying. According to multiple television reports over the weekend citing unnamed sources, talks on a potential plea deal in the former prime minister’s criminal trial have made significant progress, and the state prosecution believes the ex-Israeli leader will sign such a deal within days. Top officials assess Netanyahu has decided to go for a deal, and that an agreement could be finalized as early as next week, reports claimed. Channel 12 noted that Mandelblit strongly distrusts Netanyahu, and has rejected proposals by the latter’s attorneys to start exchanging texts of an amended charge sheet for a deal. Netanyahu, he insists, must first accept as a basic condition the framework of the deal: that he will be convicted of fraud and breach of trust; that he will remain an MK until the court determines his punishment and sentences him to 3-6 months in jail that will be commuted to community service; and that he will agree that his actions will be designated as carrying “moral turpitude” — barring him from public service for seven years. Advertisement Only after the premier fully agrees to this can the sides begin hashing out the nuts and bolts of the deal. On Saturday, Channel 13 reported that a compromise may have been found, whereby the sides would agree that the trial judges at the Jerusalem District Court will rule on whether the former Israeli leader’s actions deserve such a designation — with Mandelblit reasoning that it is virtually certain that the judges would impose the “moral turpitude” designation if Netanyahu admits to offenses of fraud and breach of trust.

Barak said that in recent months, senior figures in Netanyahu’s Likud party asked him to initiate talks with Mandelblit. “I asked them if Netanyahu sent them, they denied it,” he said. “I recently received a personal appeal from Netanyahu, and I decided not to remain indifferent.” According to Channel 12 news, Barak had refused to speak to Mandelblit on Netanyahu’s behalf so long as the appeal did not come from the former premier himself.

Channel 12 noted that Mandelblit strongly distrusts Netanyahu, and has rejected proposals by the latter’s attorneys to start exchanging texts of an amended charge sheet for a deal. Netanyahu, he insists, must first accept as a basic condition the framework of the deal: that he will be convicted of fraud and breach of trust; that he will remain an MK until the court determines his punishment and sentences him to 3-6 months in jail that will be commuted to community service; and that he will agree that his actions will be designated as carrying “moral turpitude” — barring him from public service for seven years. Advertisement Only after the premier fully agrees to this can the sides begin hashing out the nuts and bolts of the deal. On Saturday, Channel 13 reported that a compromise may have been found, whereby the sides would agree that the trial judges at the Jerusalem District Court will rule on whether the former Israeli leader’s actions deserve such a designation — with Mandelblit reasoning that it is virtually certain that the judges would impose the “moral turpitude” designation if Netanyahu admits to offenses of fraud and breach of trust.

News article:
Former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly negotiating a plea bargain to end his high-profile corruption trial and avoid spending time behind the bars by having his jail term reduced to community service. A source informed of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity on Sunday, was quoted by Reuters as saying that Netanyahu was discussing a deal with the regime's attorney general Avichai Mandelblit, under which he would plead guilty to reduced charges to have his jail term commuted to community service. The 72-year-old was indicted in November 2019 in at least three cases of alleged bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. His trial began in May 2020, but he was excused from subsequent hearings as lawyers demanded more time for prosecution evidence review. The prosecution has assembled more than 300 witnesses to back its allegations. As the most serious case of charges, Netanyahu has been accused of offering regulatory favors for media executives worth about $500 million in return for securing positive press coverage that helped him win re-election twice. In lesser charges of fraud and breach of trust, he is indicted for negotiating a deal with the owner of the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth for better coverage. In return, the prime minister allegedly promoted legislation that would slow the growth of a rival newspaper. And, Netanyahu and his wife have been charged with receiving expensive jewelry, cigars, and champagne as gifts from a Hollywood producer and an Australian billionaire. Netanyahu, now the opposition chief at the Israeli parliament, has denied all accusations and mocked the size of the witness list. Talks with Mandelblit have, meanwhile, snagged over Netanyahu's demand to be spared a conviction carrying a "moral turpitude" clause, which under the regime's law would force him to quit politics for years, said the source. Netanyahu has vowed to unseat his successor Naftali Bennett. The ex-premier's Likud Party failed to form a new government last year in part because kindred parties refused to join Netanyahu, citing the ongoing trial. This ended his 12-year-long run as the regime's prime minister. Should he clear his legal obstacles, Netanyahu might in theory be able to muster a broad new rightist coalition.

News article:
A cabinet vote on Sunday on establishing a state commission of inquiry into the so-called “submarine affair” will not take place as planned and will be delayed by at least a week, according to Hebrew media reports. Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid announced on Friday that the long-promised vote on investigating a murky deal between Israel and a German shipbuilder for naval vessels that has already resulted in multiple indictments would occur on Sunday. But the Globes business daily reported on Saturday that the vote will not be on the cabinet’s agenda this week after all. According to the report, government ministers are waiting to see what will happen with the purported plea deal being arranged between the state and former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his ongoing corruption trial. Netanyahu has long been linked to the submarine affair, and his associates have been indicted over their role, but the former prime minister has never been charged with wrongdoing in the incident and the attorney general has said he is not a suspect. The now-opposition leader is currently on trial on three unrelated and separate corruption charges, although he is reportedly close to inking a plea deal in those cases. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms But according to the Haaretz newspaper, the delay in the vote is due to the government’s ongoing negotiations to purchase submarines from Germany, in a deal that may be signed as early as this week. In October 2018, Germany approved a memorandum of understanding with Israel for the construction of three Dolphin-type submarines to be added to Israel’s fleet of six submarines, after the purchase had stalled during an Israeli investigation into alleged corruption and bribes to seal the deal. Reports at the time indicated that the agreement included a clause according to which the deal would not advance further while the corruption investigation was ongoing. It also gave Germany the right to withdraw from the deal regardless of whether any criminal conduct was ultimately uncovered by police in the purchase. Advertisement The scandal came to be known as the “submarine affair,” or Case 3000, and revolved around the allegations of a massive bribery scheme in Israel’s multi-billion-shekel purchase of naval vessels — submarines and large missile ships — from German shipbuilder Thyssenkrupp. Several of those involved in the agreement have been indicted over the affair, including close confidants of Netanyahu, who called for the procurement, though not the ex-premier himself. The scandal also involved the sale of two Dolphin-class submarines and two anti-submarine warships by Germany to Egypt, allegedly approved by Netanyahu without consulting or notifying then-defense minister Moshe Ya’alon and then-IDF chief of staff Gantz. Israel had long been granted an unofficial veto over such sales by Germany. In October, the state prosecution told the High Court of Justice that it believed there was no justification to open a criminal probe into Netanyahu over the matter. Gantz and Lapid have both promised in the past to establish a formal government investigation of the submarine affair. In the Friday statement, Gantz said that “the formation of a commission of inquiry is a necessary step to safeguard Israel’s security.” Lapid added: “The submarine affair is the most serious case of defense corruption in Israeli history, and we must leave no stone unturned to reach the truth.” Gantz submitted a formal request for a government inquiry back in October, after Justice Minister Gideon Sa’ar had indicated he would support the move. The probe also has the support of Finance Minister Avigdor Liberman. Advertisement Though there have long been calls for a government investigation into the affair by opponents of Netanyahu, his supporters have claimed that such a probe would be politically motivated, an allegation that Gantz has rejected. “The formation of the commission is critical for the defense establishment and the State of Israel — if we do not uncover the truth, we will not be able to learn lessons for the future,” Gantz said in October. His proposal called for NIS 9 million ($2.85 million) to be budgeted for the commission of inquiry, with NIS 7 million ($2.22 million) coming from his Defense Ministry and NIS 2 million ($630,000) from the Justice Ministry. Since the affair came to light in 2016, there have been multiple attempts to form a state inquiry of commission into the deal, including one by Gantz in 2020, when he attempted to probe the purchase with an internal Defense Ministry investigation. That effort was thwarted by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who said it would interfere with his own criminal probe into the affair.

Opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu has instructed his lawyers to press ahead with talks with Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit on a plea deal in his criminal corruption trial, Hebrew media reported early Monday. Netanyahu and his family met Sunday with his lawyers to decide whether to accept a plea deal. According to Channel 12 news, Netanyahu was accompanied by his wife Sara and sons Yair and Avner for the meeting at the home of his lawyer Boaz Ben Zur. Also said to be present were another of Netanyahu’s attorneys, Amit Hadad, family lawyer Yossi Cohen, and longtime confidant Natan Eshel. Following the four-hour meeting, reports said that despite misgivings from his family, he had asked his lawyers to move forward with the deal. “In the end, it’s up to one person — Netanyahu,” Channel 12 quoted a source involved in the talks as saying. “During the meeting, it was decided to move forward toward a deal.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The Ynet news site said Netanyahu’s lawyers would approach Mandelblit on Monday with a view to moving forward as soon as possible with the deal. However, the reports noted that the Netanyahu family was concerned about public opposition to the deal. Dozens of activists gathered outside Ben Zur’s home, chanting slogans against a plea deal. Advertisement Earlier, TV reports said that Sara Netanyahu had reversed her position and was now opposed to a plea deal, as were Netanyahu’s sons. A separate report carried by Channel 13 news said Sara Netanyahu was the biggest opponent of a plea deal, believing it was illegitimate that a “bureaucrat” like Mandelblit would decide on the matter. That report also said she saw no reason for her husband to accept a deal requiring him to leave politics, as she maintains that he committed no wrongdoing. Netanyahu’s lawyers, on the other hand, reportedly were in favor of the agreement and were seeking to convince the former premier to sign it, calling it “an excellent deal.” לקראת הסדר טיעון | נתניהו יצא מביתו של הסנגור בועז בן צור, לקול קריאות מפגינים: "הוא פחדן"@ittaishick pic.twitter.com/pHL5p9bbkv — כאן חדשות (@kann_news) January 16, 2022 Advertisement At the same time, multiple reports Sunday night indicated the prospects of a deal being sealed before Mandelblit’s term ends at the end of January were low. Citing unnamed sources close to Mandelblit, Channel 13 said the chance a deal would be reached was “tiny,” as it would require agreements on amending the indictment against Netanyahu and having him admit that a suspect in one of the three cases he was charged in did try to bribe him. The sources said that even if Netanyahu were to agree his actions carried a designation of “moral turpitude” — which would bar him from public office for seven years — the gaps between the two sides were too great to bridge before Mandelblit steps down. Sources close to Mandelblit also told the Haaretz daily that the chance of reaching a deal in the coming weeks was “negligible,” with too many details left to hash out, even if Netanyahu agreed to the “moral turpitude” clause and admitted to fraud and breach of trust. State prosecutors also cast doubt on the prospect of wrapping up a plea agreement before Mandelblit leaves office. “The chance that there’ll be an agreement with Mandelblit is very small, even weak. The media is going much further than the reality. Practically speaking, there’s almost no time, even if the defense accepts the attorney general’s terms,” a source in the State Attorney’s Office was quoted as saying by Channel 12 news. Additionally, the network said there were currently no negotiations taking place, with Mandelblit still waiting for Netanyahu to accept the basic terms for an agreement, including the “moral turpitude” designation. It also said some prosecutors want Netanyahu to formally retract his broadsides against police and prosecutors, and say there was no basis for his claims of bias and that he was the victim of a witch hunt. Advertisement The latest reports came after media outlets reported in recent days that Netanyahu has been resisting an agreement so far primarily due to Mandelblit’s demand that he agree that his actions involved “moral turpitude.” According to reports Saturday, Netanyahu and Mandelblit may agree to leave that decision up to the judges hearing the case. Even if Netanyahu signs a plea deal with state prosecutors, it will still need to be approved by the court. Netanyahu is on trial in three separate graft cases: for fraud and breach of trust in Case 1000 and in Case 2000, and for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in Case 4000. He denies all allegations against him, and says the charges were fabricated by a biased police force and state prosecution service, overseen by a weak attorney general, in league with political opponents and the leftist media.

News article:
(JTA) — Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly negotiating a plea deal with prosecutors in his ongoing corruption cases that could bar him from politics for several years and further reshape Israel’s political landscape. Although various Israeli media reports have swirled inconclusively for several days — including some that claim momentum for a deal is slowing — all allege that Netanyahu has laid the groundwork for a possible deal that would dismiss some of the charges against him while having him confess to “moral turpitude” in a series of corruption cases. According to Israeli law, a moral turpitude conviction would see him banned from Israeli politics for at least seven years. Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history, is currently the leader of Israel’s opposition after being ousted from power last year.

News article:
(JTA) — Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly negotiating a plea deal with prosecutors in his ongoing corruption cases that could bar him from politics for several years and further reshape Israel’s political landscape. Although various Israeli media reports have swirled inconclusively for several days — including some that claim momentum for a deal is slowing — all allege that Netanyahu has laid the groundwork for a possible deal that would dismiss some of the charges against him while having him confess to “moral turpitude” in a series of corruption cases. According to Israeli law, a moral turpitude conviction would see him banned from Israeli politics for at least seven years. Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history, is currently the leader of Israel’s opposition after being ousted from power last year. In 2020, he became the country’s first sitting prime minister to be indicted, for a series of cases involving bribery and inappropriate political gifts. In one, he allegedly sought to harm a leading Israeli newspaper in exchange for positive coverage in another. The attorney general who indicted Netanyahu, Avichai Mandelblit, is retiring at the end of January, spurring some to speculate whether he wants to end his tenure with an explosive bang. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside of Mandelblit’s house on Saturday, urging him to dismiss a plea deal and work towards convicting Netanyahu on all accounts he is charged with.

News article:
As reports — many unsourced and contradictory — have swirled in recent days claiming opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu may be nearing a plea deal in his graft trial, experts from the Israel Democracy Institute explain the legal standing of such agreements, and what the potential ramifications could be for the former prime minister. What is a plea bargain? A “plea bargain” is an agreement between a defendant and the prosecution in which the defendant confesses (in part or entirely) to having committed certain offenses, usually after the facts stated in the indictment have been amended and the severity of the alleged offenses reduced. The prosecution, for its part, agrees to drop some of the charges or to a lesser penalty, in keeping with the amended indictment. What are the rationales underlying plea bargains? First of all, plea bargains save the time and resources of the courts and the prosecution and reduce the duration of a delay of justice. They limit the potential risk to both parties (of, for example, an acquittal because of some minor flaw in the evidence, or imposition of too harsh a sentence). Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Given its current resources, the criminal justice system would not be able to function if every case had to be tried in full. In extremely complex cases, an evidentiary trial may drag out for years; the delay erodes the public interest and diminishes the impact of the verdict and sentence. When dealing with crimes against individuals, a plea bargain can spare the victim a difficult and traumatic experience that may include testifying and undergoing cross-examination. In addition, the very fact that the defendant confesses constitutes taking responsibility for the action and acknowledgment that the victim spoke the truth. Advertisement In a public case, such as that against Netanyahu, a confession would be valuable as a de facto acknowledgment that he was not being “framed” and unjustly persecuted. What are the arguments against plea bargains? To begin with, a plea bargain may deal a blow to justice: the penalty imposed generally fails to reflect the full severity of the offense and may be harmful to future deterrence. On the other hand, a plea bargain that is especially attractive may lead to false confessions, because the defendant will wish to put an end to a proceeding that is — in his or her eyes — expensive and difficult to bear. What is more, a plea bargain can undermine public confidence in the courts and the prosecution, by creating an image of legal proceedings as a haggling process (rather than one aimed at uncovering the truth and doing justice). With regard to uncovering the truth, in a public case such as that before us, the public has the right to know whether a crime was committed and what exactly took place. A plea bargain leaves these questions open and deprives the public of its right to get the answer in the court’s verdict. Advertisement What is “moral turpitude”? Is it part of every conviction? According to the Supreme Court, “moral turpitude” is a severe moral defect characterizing the person who committed a crime under the specific circumstances of its commission. A number of laws limit a person’s eligibility to hold a public position if he or she has committed a crime that carries with it moral turpitude. Sometimes the law grants the court explicit or implicit authority to determine that the crime is one of moral turpitude. Other statutes authorize certain officials, such as the Chair of the Central Elections Committee and the Attorney General, to decide whether, under specific circumstances, an offense carries with it moral turpitude. Moral turpitude is not a punishment, but rather a classification of an offense committed; its purpose is to ensure that only honest persons serve in positions that require public probity. What are the implications if Netanyahu is found guilty of offenses of moral turpitude? The Basic Law: The Knesset disqualifies a person from election to public office if sentenced to a prison term exceeding three months (including one served by means of community service) when, on the day of submission of the candidate lists, seven years have not elapsed from the completion of serving the sentence. This may be waived if the Chair of the Central Elections Committee determines that, under the specific circumstances, no moral turpitude is attached to the offense of which the person was convicted. If, however, the court’s verdict does attribute moral turpitude to the offense, the CEC chair cannot intervene. What is more, according to the Basic Law: The Knesset, if a Knesset member is convicted of a crime and the court’s verdict, of its own accord or at the request of the attorney general, rules that the offense is one of moral turpitude, the offender ceases to be a member of the Knesset on the day that the verdict becomes final. So if, in the present case, the court convicts Netanyahu and determines that his offense was one of moral turpitude, he will be expelled from the Knesset; and if he is sentenced to more than the minimum penalty, he will not be able to run for the Knesset for seven years — and, ipso facto, will not be able to form a Government. Advertisement If Netanyahu will resign from the Knesset before that, the determination of moral turpitude and his ability to run in future elections would probably be made during those future elections by the CEC chair. Is it possible to amend the ban on running for office if one has been judged guilty of moral turpitude? Theoretically, because Israel’s Basic Laws do not have protected status (some of them can be amended by a bare majority of 61 Knesset members), it might indeed be possible to cancel or modify the moral turpitude restriction on eligibility for office. This must be done by the passage of Basic Law legislation. We may assume that if this applies to past convictions as well, there will be those who will argue that the procedure is improper because of its retroactivity and its personalization (as was charged with regard to the proposal to bar a person facing criminal charges, here Netanyahu, from forming a government). Would Attorney General Mandelblit’s signature on a plea bargain agreement, or his verbal assent, be binding on the acting attorney general who will replace him in another two weeks? The Attorney General’s signature on a plea bargain agreement would bind his successor. But as long as there are only proposals on the table and negotiations, they have no legal force and the next attorney general would not be bound by them, although he or she should give due weight to his predecessor’s position and be fair to defendants who negotiated with him. Assuming that the sides reach an agreement — what procedure is required to revise the new charges to coincide with those against the other defendants? If the new charge sheet modifies the presentation of the facts in the original indictment (to be compatible with lesser offenses), while, of course, preserving the core of the allegations, it will be necessary to amend the indictments against the other defendants as well, insofar as the issues apply to them, so that they coincide with the facts that have been agreed upon. If there is no deal in the end, can the fact that negotiations were conducted have any effect on the continuation of the criminal trial? The negotiations are not supposed to have any impact on the case. This is demonstrated by the fact that after former president Moshe Katsav withdrew his consent to a very lenient deal, the prosecution took its case to court, and he was convicted of rape. Advertisement The mere conduct of negotiations should have no impact, neither weakening the charges nor as evidence that the defendant had been willing to confess. Is it possible to tie up all the loose ends in the two weeks that remain until the end of Mandelblit’s term? It is true that only a few days are left, but this does not rule out an agreement. This is a matter of goodwill on both sides and a willingness to invest maximum effort. Can the court decline to accept a plea bargain agreement? Yes. In rare cases, the court can refuse to approve the plea bargain. Especially when it comes to the sentence, it can deviate from the terms of the agreement, notably when the penalty proposed is unreasonably lighter than what it sees as appropriate and in keeping with the amended charges of which the defendant is convicted. Thus, it is likely that the indictment will be amended in good time, with regard both to the charges and the account of the actions, while maintaining the core of the charges based on them. Can the High Court of Justice intervene in a plea bargain? The High Court of Justice is empowered to conduct judicial review of a plea bargain if it finds a substantive flaw in it. But here the judicial review power is extremely limited, in view of the broad professional discretion allowed the Attorney General, and would be exercised only if there is a clear and substantive deviation from the professional discretion granted him. The court has ruled, for example when it rejected applications against the plea bargain with Katsav, that it will not seek to fill the Attorney General’s shoes and weigh the issues (such as the validity of the evidence) in his place, but will consider only whether his decision was reasonable.

Following damning reports that the Israel Police are using Pegasus software made by NSO Group to collect information on civilians, Public Security Minister Omer Bar-Lev said that the reports are false on Saturday evening. The Israeli business daily Calcalist revealed this week how the police are using the military-grade spyware to collect intelligence and create dossiers as part of early stage investigations on Israelis, even when they are not facing criminal charges. Bar-Lev, whose ministry oversees the police, told Channel 12 news, that all of the claims in the Calcalist report, "except for the fact that the Israel Police used advanced technology," are untrue. He added that Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai told him with certainty that the claims are false. "The central claim that the police are illegally spying is not true," he emphasized. The police have acknowledged use of the spyware after the report, but said a warrant was given by a court before each instance. Bar-Lev added, "I'm very happy that the Israel Police has advanced technological tools to help deal with serious crime organizations that are using advanced technology." Calcalist's report that the police listen in on a person's conversations and only after receive a warrant to do so from the attorney general is unthinkable, Bar-Lev said. "The attorney general said that the police system is operating legally; that doesn't rule out the possibility that in the past, recent or distant, an investigator decided to cut corners. Therefore, the attorney general assembled a panel to investigate." Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai said on Friday that the force will keep using its "technological tools," in response to the reports. “I want to you to be rest assured that our legal use of technological tools will continue, and our goal is to continue developing and improving these tools,” Shabtai wrote in an internal police letter. Shabtai also responded to the announcement by Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit that he intended to set up a team to investigate the claims. “The attorney general who looked into the matter, remarked in his letter that no basis had been found for the claims in the reports, and that the police had acted according to the law,” he wrote. He added that in the wake of the accusations made first by Calcalist, he has sought “to conduct a careful review of the reporter’s claims, and we have yet to find proof that the alleged events ever happened.” The commissioner stressed: “There is no and has never been a scenario in which the Israel Police have fundamentally and methodically violated the unwritten defense pact between itself and the country’s citizens. … There is no basis to the claims that the police are spying on citizens.”

The government approved on Sunday the establishment of a commission of inquiry into the so-called submarine affair , which revolves around allegations of a bribery scheme in the purchase of German ships six years ago. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The graft scandal surrounds a possible conflict of interest and bribery involving a $2 billion purchase of naval vessels from Germany's Thyssenkrupp that implicated some of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's closest associates. The former prime minister was questioned, but not named as a suspect, in the scandal, referred to as "Case 3000." 3 View gallery Naval vessels from Germany's Thyssenkrup ( Photo: The IDF Spokesperson's Unit ) Twenty six ministers voted for the establishment of a state investigation into the case, while Prime Minister Naftali Bennett abstained. He said, however, he has abstained as an act of solidarity with his Interior Minister Ayelet Shaked, who opposes a probe that would investigate the previous government, but added he agree with his coalition partners on the importance of "cleansing the corruption" from government. "Our sole consideration is the security of Israel," said Bennett. "The processes for defense acquisitions in this government are clean of outside considerations. And I'm very happy that an issue that has been unresolved for almost a decade, we've resolved in eight months. We've secured Israel for the next 50 years." The issue was supposed to be discussed at the cabinet meeting last week, but in the end, the discussion was postponed and was held on Sunday afternoon. 3 View gallery Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Defense Minister Benny Gantz ( Photo: Mark Israel Sellem, Alex Kolomoisky, IDF Spokesperson's Unit ) Back in October 2020, Defense Minister Benny Gantz examined the possibility of forming a committee to investigate the alleged submarine graft case following leaks alleging Netanyahu's involvement. The deal to procure the submarines for the Navy was signed in 2016 and involved former Netanyahu, personally. Case 3000 allegedly saw Israeli officials advocating for the purchase of submarines and patrol boats from the German shipbuilder in return for kickbacks. Netanyahu is also accused of approving Thyssenkrupp's sale of submarines and anti-submarine warships to Egypt. After the vote, Gantz said: "We promised and kept our promise, the government approved my proposal for the establishment of an inquiry committee into the submarine vessel affair. And this investigation is of the highest security necessity, and a clear message that you cannot play with Israel’s defense.” Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz said the government investigation “is a critical step in the fight against corruption and is essential for the defense establishment.” 3 View gallery Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu inside a submarine ( Photo: Reuters ) Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday called the matter “the most serious corruption scandal in Israel’s history.” Anti-Netanyahu protesters who demonstrated outside his Jerusalem residence until his ouster from office last year had called for an investigation into his role in the submarine scandal. Last week Israel signed an agreement with Germany to purchase three top-of-line submarines from Thyssenkrupp for three billion euros ($3.4 billion) to replace older ships retiring at the end of the decade. The Defense Ministry said they were not part of the state investigation.

News article:
Opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu publicly declared Monday that he has not agreed to acknowledge “moral turpitude” as part of a potential plea bargain that would end his corruption trial, and said he had no intention of leaving politics. He issued the video statement, his first public reference to two weeks of reports on behind-the-scenes negotiations on a possible deal, in an apparent response to the collapse of the talks with Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit. The former prime minister vowed to remain the leader of his Likud party and of the right-wing political camp, and to eventually return to power and lead the country. Soon after the video was posted to his social media accounts, a spate of Hebrew media reports said Mandelblit, whose term ends in a week, had earlier in the day informed Netanyahu’s attorneys that negotiations on a deal would have to wait until a new attorney general takes office. Channel 13 claimed, without citing sources, that Netanyahu recorded the video last week and decided to publish it after Mandelblit informed his lawyers that negotiations would not be completed during his term. Sources familiar with the talks told the network that Netanyahu had in fact agreed to a moral turpitude plea, but then stepped back after Mandelblit’s notification. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “In recent days, there were mistaken claims made in the media on things that I allegedly agreed to, such as the claim that I agreed to moral turpitude,” Netanyahu said. “That is simply not correct.” “I will continue to lead the Likud and the national camp in order to lead Israel, on your behalf,” he promised. Netanyahu also thanked his “millions” of supporters and reiterated his accusation that he is being mistreated by law enforcement officials and the justice system, declaring that “the entire public can see what is happening in the courthouse and how the investigation against me was handled.” Advertisement He insisted that the proper course of action was to simply close the cases against him, “but that still hasn’t happened.” Netanyahu had reportedly been hoping to seal a deal with Mandelblit, believing that the latter — a Netanyahu appointee — wanted to end his six-year term with a clean slate. However, media reports have increasingly indicated that the talks were proceeding too slowly, and the mistrust between the sides was too great, for a deal to be finalized before Mandelblit retires. Since reports of the negotiations emerged earlier this month, they generally said Mandelblit was demanding that any plea deal with Netanyahu include a clause of “moral turpitude” — which would bar Netanyahu from public office for seven years. Some reports said that a period of just two years was also discussed in the plea bargain, and that Mandelblit backtracked after agreeing to this. In addition, the reports said that other charges would be significantly lowered in two of the cases against the former premier, and dismissed in the third. The requirement for moral turpitude was underlined last Thursday by Deputy State Attorney Shlomo Lamberger, who made the first public remarks by a senior justice official on the offer, telling a conference held by the Israel Bar Association that it would be “inconceivable” for a plea deal not to include such a clause. Both the Channel 12 and Channel 13 news stations assessed that Netanyahu’s relatively mild rhetoric in Monday’s video statement still leaves an opening for him to continue plea negotiations in the future. Netanyahu was reported last week to be prepared to agree to moral turpitude but not as an opening commitment, in part because of his mistrust of Mandelblit and concern that a deal would fall apart. Advertisement Reacting to the developments, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid told Channel 13 later Monday evening that Netanyahu’s video was “proof” of the need to pass a law he previously initiated as head of the opposition, which would bar anyone convicted of moral turpitude from serving as prime minister, minister, Knesset member or mayor. Lapid said he suggested that law “precisely to prevent these kinds of phenomena. We must let the judicial process take its course.” While refusing to say whether he supports a plea deal for Netanyahu, Lapid said the opposition chief “is damaging the political system and the State of Israel. He causes more rifts and divisions than anybody else. The most important thing for us [in the coalition] is to enable some kind of unity among the people of Israel. You can’t do that when someone keeps adding fuel to the fire. He causes damage.” The message Mandelblit reportedly sent to Netanyahu’s legal team on Monday marked an acknowledgment by the attorney general that he would not personally be able to see out the biggest case of his tenure. Netanyahu, 72, is on trial in three separate graft cases: for fraud and breach of trust in Case 1000 and in Case 2000, and for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in Case 4000. Under the reported potential deal, the bribery charge in Case 4000 would have been dropped, and Case 2000 closed altogether. Mandelblit was said to have demanded that Netanyahu admit to fraud and breach of trust in cases 1000 and 4000; accept the designation of moral turpitude; be sentenced to seven to nine months of community service; and admit to having instructed former Communications Ministry director Shlomo Filber to provide benefits to the controlling shareholder of the Bezeq media company, Shaul Elovitch — the main accusation against the former premier in case 4000. Netanyahu denies all allegations against him, and claims the charges were fabricated by a biased police force and state prosecution service, overseen by a weak attorney general, in league with political opponents and the leftist media.

In the seven months since the government’s establishment, ministers have conducted at least 46 flights and trips abroad, at a cost of NIS 10-16 million ($3-5 million), according to a report Monday. The report was published following a query to Knesset by the opposition’s Likud MK Yariv Levin on the matter. According to Walla news, the data was based on reports by the ministers themselves and not by the government’s accountant general. Some responded to the query without detailing the travel costs, and some forwarded incomplete reports, omitting the security costs or not including trips that were made after the query’s filing date. The calculation of the total costs is only an estimate and is also based on estimates from conversations with government officials. At the same time, the summary of answers provides rare data regarding government spending on flights and travel in the first half-year of its existence. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Topping the list of frequent fliers were Defense Minister Benny Gantz, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid and Prime Minister Naftali Bennett — who has made six official trips abroad since coming into office in June.

In October he went to Sochi, Russia, for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, later that month flying to Glasgow, Scotland, to attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference. In December, he flew to the UAE, the first public visit by an Israeli premier to the Gulf state. The Prime Minister’s Office wrote in response to Levin’s query that it would only list visits “that can be detailed in this framework,” implying Bennett has made additional secret trips during this period. Advertisement According to the report, the total cost of the six visits came to NIS 5,740,017 ($1,806,235). This does not include lodging, security and other expenses, which add another 20%-30% to the total costs. For comparison, former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu made 14 official trips in 2017 and 16 in 2018. A Freedom of Information request in 2018 showed that the trips cost around NIS 85 million ($26,747,647). According to Walla, the reports given by Gantz and Lapid were less detailed. The foreign minister’s office said the top diplomat took eight “important policy trips,” without specifying to which countries, and said they cost NIS 3 million ($944,102) — about half of the Foreign Ministry’s annual budget for the minister’s travel. In line with his role, Lapid has since taking office visited the United States, Russia, the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, the European Union’s headquarters in Brussels, Italy, Paris and London. Since the submission of the query, Lapid has had another one-day trip to Egypt in December, where he met with Sissi. Gantz provided a list of trips that took place during the previous and current government, without addressing the question of costs at all. Advertisement He reported five trips he has made as defense minister in the current government: to France, Singapore, Morocco, the United States and Jordan. Two other ministers who refused to detail their trips’ costs were Communications Minister Yoaz Hendel and Eli Avidar, a minister in the Prime Minister’s Office. Seven ministers have not traveled anywhere since the government was formed: Finance Minister Avigdor Liberman, Justice Minister Gideon Sa’ar, Education Minister Yifat Shasha-Bitton, Interior Security Minister Omer Barlev, Minister in the Finance Ministry Hamad Amar, and Social Equality Minister Meirav Cohen.

In the seven months since the government’s establishment, ministers have conducted at least 46 flights and trips abroad, at a cost of NIS 10-16 million ($3-5 million), according to a report Monday. The report was published following a query to Knesset by the opposition’s Likud MK Yariv Levin on the matter. According to Walla news, the data was based on reports by the ministers themselves and not by the government’s accountant general. Some responded to the query without detailing the travel costs, and some forwarded incomplete reports, omitting the security costs or not including trips that were made after the query’s filing date. The calculation of the total costs is only an estimate and is also based on estimates from conversations with government officials. At the same time, the summary of answers provides rare data regarding government spending on flights and travel in the first half-year of its existence.

News article:
Israel police used spyware to access data in the phone of an individual involved in the trial of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a report said on Wednesday. The hack, reported on Channel 13 News, was discovered by the Justice Ministry during its review of the police's use of the spyware. LISTEN: What an attack on Ukraine will mean for Biden – and Israel The police reportedly claimed that the investigators never received the data, which was gathered against the police's procedures. In response to the report the police said they "will cooperate fully and transparently in any examination required by the team appointed." Attorney Jacques Chen, representing Shaul and Iris Elovich, who stand accused of bribing Netanyahu in Case 4000, responded to the report, saying “If it's true, this is a serious crime, yet another expression of the loss of all restraint in the investigation against the Elovich couple, of which we have been warning for years. In a country of laws, it is obvious that there should be far-reaching ramifications, and no doubt we have yet to hear the final word on the matter.” On Tuesday, Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit announced the appointment of an inquiry team into reports the force targeted activists and other Israelis with NSO's Pegasus. Israel Police later admitted misusing of spyware by the force. In a brief statement that doesn't go into any specific cases, the police said “additional findings” from its internal probe “change in some ways” an earlier statement last month that ruled out any wrongdoing. In January, news site Calcalist published a report alleging that the police used the Pegasus spyware on Israelis without court authorization since 2013, and it has since been used against a list of targets that includes protest leaders, politicians and others. The Pegasus spyware allows its operators to remotely access mobile phones infected with the software. Sold to intelligence and law enforcement agencies across the world, the spyware exploits security vulnerabilities in Android and iPhone operating systems to gain access to the device's contents – from messages to photos. The program also enables to remotely activate the phone’s camera and microphone, without the victim's knowledge. Following the bombshell report, the Israel Police said that they have always used the software with a warrant, and under no circumstances did they take data from the phones.

The alleged draining by police of the contents of the phone of a key witness in the trial against Benjamin Netanyahu is likely to delay the legal proceedings, according to Thursday television reports. The Jerusalem District Court will likely need to decide on Monday whether to halt Netanyahu’s trial until police and prosecutors can clarify the extent to which phone hacking was used in the cases against the former prime minister, according to Channel 12 news. The network noted it was highly likely the trial would be delayed, though reports this week that Shlomo Filber’s phone was hacked could affect his testimony, set to begin in two weeks, and potentially impact the trial on other ways. So far, reports have indicated that police, without the necessary approval from a judge, used spyware to drain all the data from the phone of Filber, a former director-general of the Communications Ministry and longtime confidant of Netanyahu who is a key state’s witness in Case 4000, the most serious of the cases against the former prime minister. Attorneys for Netanyahu and other defendants in the case have demanded to know exactly what data was obtained, what use was made of it, and whether others involved in the trial were also targeted, among other questions. Prosecutors have responded that they are examining the matter. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Channel 12 reported Thursday night that Filber’s phone was accessed in 2017, and had the entirety of its content drained using unnamed spyware. The network said that the discovery that Filber’s phone had been targeted was made in the course of an unrelated investigation, ordered by the attorney general, into alleged police abuse of the controversial NSO Group’s Pegasus software, but that a different technology was used to access Filber’s phone. Police brass reportedly told justice officials that the data was downloaded accidentally and was never given to investigators in the Netanyahu cases. According to Channel 13, after news broke of police allegedly misusing Pegasus, Netanyahu’s attorneys asked the Justice Ministry if it knew of any cases of such abuse related to the former prime minister’s graft trial. Advertisement According to the report, police “misled” the ministry for two weeks when asked whether it had used penetrative tech to drain Filber’s phone, and in general, without prior approval. Only in recent days did police say there was actually a case in which phone data was accessed from someone involved in the Netanyahu trial without approval — the case of Filber. Criminal attorney Boaz Koenig, speaking to Channel 12, noted that in Israel, unlike the US, evidence obtained illegally is not necessarily inadmissible in court. According to sources cited by both networks, the data from Filber’s phone never made its way to investigators. Channel 12 on Wednesday aired barely audible voice recordings in which police investigators seemed to discuss hacking a person’s phone, just before conducting an interview with Filber. Netanyahu on Wednesday evening called the revelations an “earthquake.” Advertisement Likud’s faction chair Yariv Levin termed them “a giant Watergate affair, here in Israel” and called for the Netanyahu trial to be shut down. “It is time to say clearly: Netanyahu’s trial should be closed immediately. The investigation and indictment processes are fundamentally tainted with a chain of grave offenses,” Levin said. “This is a groundbreaking event. An event on a historical scale. An event that will decide the future of Israel,” he added. Asked whether he thought his phone might have been hacked by police, another key state’s witness against Netanyahu, his former senior aide Nir Hefetz, who has already testified, said Thursday that “anything is possible.” Police said in a statement Thursday that they would continue to “cooperate fully and transparently” with the investigation team appointed by the attorney general, which is looking into reports that it repeatedly used hacking software from the NSO Group and others to break into citizens’ phones illegally. Netanyahu is on trial in three cases, having been indicted for fraud and breach of trust in cases 1000 and 2000, and for bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in Case 4000. He denies all wrongdoing and claims the charges were fabricated by a biased police force and state prosecution, led by a weak attorney general, backed by leftist politicians and the media. Case 4000, the most serious of the three cases against the former prime minister, alleges that Netanyahu advanced regulatory decisions as communications minister and prime minister that immensely benefited Walla owner Shaul Elovitch, the controlling shareholder in Bezeq, the country’s largest telecommunications firm, despite opposition from the Communication Ministry’s career officials. In exchange, he allegedly was given what amounted to editorial control over Elovitch’s Walla news site.

News article:
Foriegn Minister Yair Lapid says as the government decides on what sort of commission to establish to examine the NSO police spying scandal, those at the top should not think they are immune. Those who used to be at the top, at least. Lapid says the first one investigated by the commission should be Likud MK Amir Ohana, who was justice minister from June 2019 to May 2020 and then public security minister until June of last year. Notably, all other justice ministers aside from Ohana in the last seven years have been figures in parties aligned with Lapid’s government. Gilad Erdan, who Lapid has kept on as UN ambassador, was public security minister before Ohana. He says it will take a week for the government to decide whether to establish a government inquiry or a state commission which would have wider powers. He also defends the police, saying “only criminals will be happy if they are dismantled,” echoing rhetoric in the US against calls to defund law enforcement there. “But along with that, gatekeepers of the law need to be the ones who keep the rules better than anyone. Nobody is immune from investigation,” he says. The scandal “clouds Israeli democracy,” he adds.

Israel's ex-Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit, who concluded his six-year term in office last week, ordered the police to halt the use of the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware other than in cases where lives are at risk, just before leaving office. The order came alongside Mendelblit's call to form an investigative team to look into allegations that the police had made use of the spyware in ways that violated the law. "Netanyahu bet everything on Trump": Inside Israel's Iran bind. LISTEN A senior police official told Haaretz that the police's cyber-SIGINT unit, which allegedly made use of the surveillance spyware, “grew to become a monster that operated independently, without oversight or control from investigation officials. [It was a] black hole in which the rest of the police force had no idea what was happening.” The source surmised that the spyware was used to develop intelligence information in violation of the law. “If they also transferred it for use by the investigators, that’s highly serious, and if they wrote it down somewhere, that’s no less serious, but I highly doubt that it came as a result of a directive from any senior official,” he said. Disclosure of the purported illegal use of the software by the police was reported in a series of articles published by Israel’s Calcalist business daily, including new information reported on Monday. According to one police source, on Monday morning the police began looking into the incidents and the names of the individuals featured in Monday’s Calcalist report. As of Monday afternoon, the police had only confirmed that Pegasus spyware, which enables its user to hack into cellphones and take control of them, had been used pursuant to court orders against Israeli mayors who were suspected of criminal activity. The other names featured in the Calcalist article had not been targeted by the police, said the source, who added that the inquiry was ongoing. About a week ago, in announcing the convening of the investigative team, Attorney General Mendelblit said he had directed the police “to take immediate steps to prevent [the police] from exceeding their authority.” On the same day, for the first time, the police admitted misuse of spyware but law enforcement sources said at the time that the misuse was of other surveillance software and not NSO’s Pegasus spyware. According to the report Monday, the hacking tool was used without a court order and against Netanyahu's son, Avner, co-defendant in his criminal trial Iris Elovitch, leaders of disability rights protests, journalists at Walla news website, businessman Rami Levy, mayors and senior officials in the Finance Ministry, and others.

News article:
The judges in former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s ongoing corruption trial on Monday cancelled a scheduled court hearing for the next day, as they await answers about swirling police phone spying allegations. The Jerusalem District Court gave prosecutors until 2 p.m. Tuesday to respond to questions regarding the illicit phone spying. The judges will convene Wednesday to discuss how to proceed, the court said. The decision came after the court had earlier rejected a request for a delay by attorneys for Netanyahu and other defendants. The attorneys filed the petition calling for a pause following an explosive report Monday morning that said the Israel Police used the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware to hack into the phones of a wide range of public figures — including associates and family members of Netanyahu as well as multiple people currently involved in the trial — without any judicial oversight or approval. According to the report, which was unsourced, police hacked the phones, among others, of former Walla CEO Ilan Yeshua; former Communications Ministry directors general Shlomo Filber and Avi Berger; Iris Elovitch, the wife of Shaul Elovitch, the former controlling shareholder of Bezeq, both of whom are defendants in the Netanyahu trial; former Bezeq CEOs Dudu Mizrachi and Stella Hendler; former Walla editor-in-chief Aviram Elad, and other journalists at Walla. The abuse use of the spyware reportedly extended far beyond people involved in the Netanyahu investigation and trial, with those illicitly targeted also said to include activists and demonstrators (including against Netanyahu), mayors, ministry director-generals, journalists and others. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms In Case 4000, one of the three graft cases for which the former prime minister is on trial, Netanyahu is alleged to have advanced regulatory decisions as communications minister and prime minister that immensely benefited Elovitch, in exchange for editorial control over the Walla news site. The former premier denies the charges against him. Yeshua, the first witness to testify in the corruption trial, appeared in court repeatedly over a period of several months. Elad and Berger have also testified, and Filber had been slated to take the stand in the coming weeks. Jack Chen, an attorney for the Elovitches, said Monday that “for years we have been warning against a flawed and tendentious investigation that crossed all boundaries.” Today, he said, in light of the reports, “nobody can keep saying that we exaggerated.” Advertisement Chen said “the most urgent thing to do for all of our sakes is to stop, conduct an independent investigation of what happened, understand its significance and then start making corrections.” The report published Monday, weeks after Calcalist first reported on the alleged police use of such tactics, also said that Avner Netanyahu, the son of the former prime minister, and Netanyahu advisers Yonatan Urich and Topaz Luk had been targeted. Avner Netanyahu’s phone was said to have been hacked due to police suspicions that his mother, Sara, used it. News that Filber was targeted by police spying first broke last week, though the Kan public broadcaster reported that so far, prosecutors believe any improper use of spyware technology was not tied to evidence used in the Netanyahu case. On Friday, the Jerusalem District Court gave state prosecutors until Tuesday to answer questions from the defense about police use of spyware in the investigation into the former premier. Attorneys for Netanyahu and other defendants in the case have demanded to know exactly what data was obtained, how it was used and whether others involved in the trial were also targeted in the operation, among other questions. Prosecutors have said they are examining the matter.

News article:
State prosecutors said Sunday in an interim statement that a police check turned up no evidence that officers wiretapped phones without a warrant during their investigation of alleged misdeeds by former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. However, the prosecution, in a letter to the Jerusalem District Court, did not comment on how and how many warrants were executed and, critically, whether spyware had been employed against the subjects of investigations. Prosecutors relied on “information provided by competent authorities within the Israel Police” to check about 1,500 phone numbers associated with parties investigated in the three graft cases against Netanyahu, known as cases 1000, 2000, and 4000. The check focused on both standard wiretapping and the use of more “advanced” technologies, according to the prosecution’s update to the court. The list of 1,500 numbers was compiled from the list of existing search orders, as well as phone numbers belonging to parties followed in the investigation. No information was provided on the subset of phones within the 1,500 that were searched or listened to, only to say that the police confirmed that all phones touched by the investigation had a court order attached to them.

The prosecution requested three more days to complete its check, which is expected to answer questions “related to the manner in which the [court] orders issued were used,” according to the prosecution’s letter to the court. In a statement following the state prosecution’s announcements, the defense attorneys in the trial said that “the prosecution admits that it spied on civilians. No order authorized the police to use spyware.

Some of the names listed in that report were also checked ahead of the latest update to the court, because they were involved in the police investigation into Netanyahu.

Associates of former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu reject claims by state prosecutors that instances of improper spying on witnesses in his corruption trial are irrelevant. “We completely reject the claims of the prosecutors and the police,” his associates say in a statement released to Israeli media. “It’s unacceptable for investigators to investigate themselves without anyone being questioned and without revealing to the public the information obtained through illegal spying.” They suggest the findings are “just the tip of the iceberg in police spying against Israeli citizens.” Earlier today, prosecutors in the case told the court that their initial probe found that only one person linked to the case — Shlomo Filber — was improperly spied on by police, but that no relevant information was found or used, and therefore the trial should proceed.

State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman on Thursday confirmed he is carrying out an “in-depth” investigation into bombshell claims that Israel Police spied on Israeli citizens. “Maintaining privacy is a cornerstone of a democratic state,” Englman said during a conference in Jerusalem. “We will carry out an in-depth examination of all the conduct of law enforcement agencies through technological means.” Englman announced last month that he would probe claims that police used the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware to hack into the phones of private citizens who were not suspected of crimes without any warrant or judicial oversight. Current and former senior police officers have denied the claims, made in unsourced reports in the Calcalist daily, and initial investigations by the police and the deputy attorney general have reportedly found no such abuse. The police have acknowledged hacking the phone of Shlomo Filber, a state’s witness in the trial of Benjamin Netanyahu, and say they have targeted the phones of criminal suspects with judicial authorization. Englman said his probe will involve a series of internal and external experts as well as individuals who previously served in intelligence positions.

And — what are the procedures for using these means on citizens’ phones. We will also check the information security of data collected by the police — whether [the data are] protected against possible leaks,” he said. Englman said he respected the current investigation being overseen by Deputy Attorney General Amit Marari, but said “it is important that there be an audit by the State Comptroller, which is an independent body.” Marari’s ongoing investigation, aided by former officials from the Shin Bet and Mossad and with input from the NSO Group, is looking into whether police made illicit use of spy software to break into the phones of 26 people named earlier this month by the Calcalist newspaper. Advertisement This investigation has found that most of those named in the newspaper report were not targeted, a Wednesday report said. Channel 12 news said Marari’s probe has established that NSO’s Pegasus spyware was not used, among others, against three former directors of government ministries: Shai Babad, Keren Terner Eyal and Emi Palmor. The allegation that police used spyware to target the three former senior civil servants — none of whom is suspected of any criminal activity — was among the most incendiary elements of the Calcalist report. The prime minister’s son, Avner Netanyahu, also named in the Calcalist report, was also not spied on, the Marari probe has reportedly established. According to Channel 12, some individuals named by Calcalist were subjected to police phone hacking via spyware, but they were suspected of criminal activity and the spyware was used with judicial approval. The Marari team is expected to soon present its findings to Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, Public Security Minister Gideon Sa’ar and Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara. NSO’s Pegasus is considered one of the most powerful cyber-surveillance tools available on the market, giving operators the ability to effectively take full control of a target’s phone, download all data from the device, or activate its camera or microphone without the user knowing. Advertisement The company has been involved in numerous scandals in recent years and has faced a torrent of international criticism over allegations it allows governments, including dictatorships and authoritarian regimes, to spy on dissidents and rights activists. It was blacklisted by the US last year along with several other firms. On Tuesday, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), an independent EU watchdog on privacy concerns, called for a ban on Pegasus spyware within the European Union. “A ban on the development and deployment of spyware with the capability of Pegasus in the EU would be the most effective option,” the EDPS wrote in a new report. The organization says that the spyware, which infiltrates smartphones and can access all data available on the phone, is “incompatible with our democratic values.” Spyware like Pegasus “has the potential to cause unprecedented risks and damages not only to the fundamental freedoms but also to democracy and the rule of law,” EDPS said. NSO has insisted that its software is intended for use only in fighting terrorism and other crimes, that it bars sales to those it believes will abuse it and halts contracts if it discovers abuse. Its CEO said in a recent interview that NSO’s presence on the US blacklist was “an outrage.”

News article:
The Israeli journalist who has led reporting on the police’s alleged illicit use of spyware on civilians defended his reporting on Saturday, amid growing doubts about its veracity. The Calcalist business daily has made bombshell allegations about Israeli police using spyware without proper oversight, which were initially met with calls from across the political spectrum for investigations. However, government officials have backpedaled recently, with separate probes by the police and deputy attorney general said to largely debunk the unsourced newspaper claims. Calcalist reporter Tomer Ganon said on Twitter on Saturday, “I swore to my sources: I will protect you until the full truth comes out. I pledged: I will protect everything that is dear to you — freedom, family, careers — because you chose not to be silent and to uncover the truth.” “I have risked my good name not as a result of gullibility, but only because I checked the facts,” he said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Shortly after issuing the statement, Ganon’s Twitter account was disabled. It wasn’t clear whether he took it down himself, or the platform removed it. Police and justice officials have so far said their probes have not found evidence of any widespread wrongdoing by police, and some have called on Ganon to provide more information to back up his claims. Politicians and other media outlets have also called on Calcalist to provide evidence supporting the allegations. Advertisement Reports have swirled over the past two weeks that the Israel Police used spyware by the NSO Group surveillance company without judicial approval to target many public officials and activists, including figures central to Benjamin Netanyahu’s ongoing corruption trial. Current and former senior police officers have denied the claims. The police have acknowledged mistakes hacking the phone of Shlomo Filber, a state’s witness in Netanyahu’s trial, and say they have targeted the phones of criminal suspects with judicial authorization. An internal police probe whose results were handed to Prime Minister Naftali Bennett last week claimed that out of the 26 people named by Calcalist to have been illicitly spied on by police, only three of them had been targeted, only one successfully, and all with judicial oversight. An investigation being overseen by Deputy Attorney General Amit Marari, aided by former officials from the Shin Bet and Mossad and with input from the NSO Group, has also found that most of those named in the newspaper report were not targeted, Channel 12 reported. Calcalist said police had illicitly targeted three former directors of government ministries — Shai Babad, Keren Terner and Emi Palmor — but Marari’s probe reportedly found police did not deploy spyware against them. The allegation that police used spyware to target the three former senior civil servants — none of whom is suspected of any criminal activity — was among the most incendiary elements of the Calcalist report. The prime minister’s son, Avner Netanyahu, also named in the Calcalist report, was also not spied on, the Marari probe has reportedly established. Advertisement According to Channel 12, there were some individuals named by Calcalist who were subjected to police phone hacking via spyware, but they were suspected of criminal activity and the use of spyware was given judicial approval. The network reported Friday that the Shin Bet and Mossad team working with Marari had completed its work, and that Marari had presented the probe’s findings to Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara on Thursday. The report said investigators checked 8,000 phone numbers and looked at evidence going back to 2015. In yet another probe, State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman said Thursday he was carrying out an “in-depth” investigation into the claims against police. In an interview with Channel 13 news on Thursday, Justice Minister Gideon Sa’ar suggested that there is not enough evidence to support establishing a state commission of inquiry into the allegations of police hacking. The allegations have also caused complications for Netanyahu’s corruption trial. Prosecutors in Netanyahu’s ongoing trial told the Jerusalem District Court on Wednesday that spyware was used by police to hack Filber’s phone, but that no material discovered was used and that trial proceedings should continue as scheduled. Prosecutors claim that the spyware was activated on Filber’s phone for about a day, but that no material relevant to the case was found. Advertisement Lawyers for the defendants and associates of Netanyahu rejected the state prosecutors’ claims and demanded a state commission of inquiry. Netanyahu is currently on trial in three corruption cases. He faces charges of fraud and breach of trust in Case 1000 and in Case 2000, and charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in Case 4000. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing, and says the charges were fabricated by a biased police force and state prosecution service, overseen by a weak attorney general, in league with political opponents and the media.

Members of Israeli border police patrol near the scene of a security incident at an Israeli military base near Jenin in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, May 7, 2021. REUTERS/Raneen Sawafta Asharq Al-Awsat Eight Palestinians died on Thursday when the van they rode in collided with a cement truck in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian official media said. The two vehicles slammed into each other at a junction on Route 90, which runs up the Jordan Valley and is under Israeli security control near the northern West Bank village of Fasayil, according to the Wafa news agency. A medic with the Magen David Adom Israeli rescue services said in a statement that the scene at the crash site was "shocking". "We saw a truck and a private vehicle crushed on the side of the road," he said. The victims were not officially identified but local news outlets reported they were teenagers between 14 and 17 years old. AFP was not able to verify this. Wafa said that Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas declared a day of mourning to be observed on Friday across the Palestinian territories in honor of the victims. Medics declared seven people dead at the scene, and Wafa later reported an additional victim. Three injured people were evacuated to Israeli hospitals via helicopter. Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz issued a note of sympathy published in Arabic and Hebrew. "I would like to convey my heartfelt condolences to the Palestinian families who lost eight of their loved ones today" in the crash, he said. Neighboring Jordan also expressed condolences. Palestinian police told AFP that the victims were workers from the town of Aqraba, near Nablus.

News article:
A cleaner who was paralyzed after falling down an unfenced elevator shaft at a construction site bears no blame for the accident and is therefore entitled to full compensation, the Supreme Court has ruled. The justices said they made this decision due to the inherent imbalance of power between the worker and his employer, and also because another worker at the site had previously warned of the danger. They thereby overturned the Haifa District Court’s ruling that the worker also shares some of the blame. ‘I hope we won’t need it’: Israel’s doomsday option against Iran. LISTEN The worker, a Palestinian whose name is under a gag order, was paralyzed from the waist down after falling four stories down the shaft in 2014. He was working in a building at a construction site in Beit Shemesh run by the Stern Group. “It’s hard to expect a worker to stand up to his employer and refuse to continue working due to dangers of some kind when his daily bread lies in the balance,” Justice Neal Hendel wrote in a verdict issued late last month. Justices Ofer Grosskopf and David Mintz concurred. Open gallery view Construction workers in Tel Aviv. “Work safety regulations weren’t intended to examine whether the worker is complying with their implementation,” Hendel continued. “Therefore, once his employer failed to strictly comply with safety regulations ... he should not be allowed to point the finger of blame at the worker for failing to demand this.” Even though the worker never complained to his managers about the lack of fencing around the elevator shaft, Hendel added, it’s not clear whether he was ever given any training about safety. The district court had ruled that the company owed the worker some compensation, since it failed to fence off the elevator shaft and provided the worker with no protective equipment. Nevertheless, it added, the worker is guilty of “contributory negligence,” because he had experience in the construction industry in general and with this building site in particular, and therefore knew the shaft wasn’t fenced. The lower court’s ruling also cited the worker’s failure to complain about the lack of fencing and the fact that he continued working at the site despite the danger of falling. It set his share of the blame at 15 percent of the total damages. The Supreme Court agreed that there are times when a worker takes unreasonable risks, or ignores such risks, and thereby contributes to his own injury. But there are also cases in which the worker simply makes a mistake or gets caught up in his work, and that is not sufficient to warrant assigning him a share of the blame, it continued. The current case, it added, belongs in the latter category. “This is a precedent-setting ruling,” the worker’s lawyers, Uri Gilboa and Amit Uria, said in a statement. “We’re certain that if it reverberates, it will affect change, because the understanding that ordinary workers can’t be blamed for the failures of the employer, who could prevent the accident with a minimal investment, will gradually seep in.”

The Biden administration is seeking clarification from Israel after an 80-year-old Palestinian-American died of a heart attack he suffered following his arrest by Israeli soldiers near Ramallah on Wednesday morning. According to Omar Abd al-Majid As’ad’s family, Israeli soldiers tied his hands and beat him after the arrest in his hometown of Jiljilya, before apparently releasing him from detention. Before As’ad’s arrest, the Israeli army had conducted intensive patrols and random stops in the village over the past two days, culminating in a predawn raid on Wednesday morning, Jiljilya mayor Fouad Qattum said in a phone call. “More than 50 soldiers entered the village early this morning, patrolling around the village and between the homes. Amr As’ad, the martyr, was returning home from his relatives and they dragged him out of his car,” Qattum said. After being detained in an empty house, As’ad, who suffered from diabetes and other chronic conditions, apparently suffered a heart attack, Qattum said. It was not clear if the soldiers were present when he collapsed.

It was only by coincidence that young men from the village happened to spot him there hours later,” Qattum said. He was taken to a local Palestinian health clinic before being transferred to the Palestine Medical Center in Ramallah, where he died, the Palestinian Authority health ministry said in a statement. The Israel Defense Forces said Military Police opened an investigation into As’ad’s death. In a statement, the military confirmed that As’ad was arrested overnight, but did not comment on the Palestinian allegations of violence. “The Palestinian was arrested during an operation by IDF troops after he refused a security search. The detainee was released later that night,” the military said. Asked for comment on the matter during the daily press briefing, US State Department spokesman Ned Price began by confirming that As’ad was an American citizen. “We have been in touch with Mr. As’ad’s family to express our condolences about this tragedy. We’re providing all of the consular assistance to the family at this time,” he said. Advertisement “We’ve also been in touch with the government of Israel to seek clarification about this incident, and as you may have seen the Israeli Defense Forces have indicated that there’s an ongoing investigation into the matter.” “We support a thorough investigation into the circumstances of this incident,” Price added. The military conducts arrest operations on a nightly basis, often arresting tens or dozens of Palestinians on suspicion of involvement in terror activity. Tensions have been rising between Israel and the Palestinians across the West Bank and Gaza over the past month, including a wave of terror attacks that so far have taken the lives of two Israeli civilians and wounded several others.

News article:
Palestinians have held a funeral procession for a 57-year-old man who died of tear gas inhalation during an Israeli raid on a refugee camp north of the city of al-Quds. The victim, identified as Fahmi Hamad, was one of the three Palestinians hospitalized after the Israeli forces stormed the Qalandiya camp on Monday. Local medical sources said the Israeli soldiers fired a barrage of gas bombs and rubber-coated steel bullets at Palestinians, who protested the raid, as well as a clinic run by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). The occupation forces, they added, also ransacked several Palestinian houses and shops. Hamad suffered from severe effects of tear gas inhalation while inside the UNRWA clinic and was rushed to a hospital in the occupied West Bank city Ramallah, but he succumbed to his wounds, according to the medical sources. One of Hamad’s relatives said the man had chronic health issues, such as kidney failure and diabetes, and constantly visited the clinic for medical treatment. Israeli forces frequently storm Palestinian neighborhoods in the occupied territories. They often use live fire and tear gas to crack down on any act of protest against their presence. The atrocities committed by the Tel Aviv regime have resulted in many Palestinian deaths and injuries. ‘West Bank situation nearing boiling point’ In a separate development on Monday, an Israeli research institute and think tank affiliated with Tel Aviv University presented its annual assessment to the regime’s president. The Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) warned that the absence of a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict “poses a serious threat” to Tel Aviv’s status on the international stage. “The security situation in the West Bank is nearing a boiling point due to the weakness of the Palestinian Authority in the face of united opposition from various factions and street gangs,” it said. “Internationally, there is growing criticism of Israel, which in fact works to thwart the chances of implementing” the so-called two-state solution and “intensifies the danger of legal moves against Israel and its definition as an apartheid state.” The INSS also asserted that in the besieged Gaza Strip, “Israel currently faces the same complex and long-lasting dilemma: the need for an urgent response to the humanitarian situation, while avoiding security escalation.”

News article:
Israeli forces have injured dozens of Palestinians taking part in protests against Israeli settlements in several areas across the occupied West Bank. On Friday, Israeli forces suppressed a weekly anti-settlement rally in Kafr Qaddum, using rubber bullets and tear gas. Palestine's WAFA news agency cited Murad Shteiwi, a media spokesman in the Qalqilya region, as saying that four Palestinians, including a child and a journalist, were hit by rubber bullets during the attack. According to the report, tens of protesters also suffered breathing difficulties due to inhaling tear gas fired by the Israeli forces. Also on Friday, dozens of Palestinians suffered breathing difficulties as Israeli troops fired tear gas during clashes on Sobeih Mountain in the town of Beita, south of Nablus. Since May, Beita has seen intensified clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians protesting against a settlement outpost that has been established on Sobeih Mountain by settlers under the protection of Israeli forces. To the east of Nablus, several injuries were also reported as Israeli forces attacked Palestinians taking part in a peaceful anti-settlement protest in the village of Beit Dajan on Friday. Palestinian media outlets cited the Palestine Red Crescent ambulance service as saying that 15 Palestinians were hit by rubber bullets, including a volunteer with the Red Crescent, during the attack, adding that nine others suffered breathing difficulties due to the tear gas fired by Israeli troops. Meanwhile, clashes erupted in the area of Bab a-Zawiyah in the center of al-Khalil (Hebron) on Friday as the Israeli forces stationed at a military checkpoint at the entrance of al-Shuhada Street fired rubber bullets, sound bombs, and tear gas at Palestinians. The report added that tens of Palestinians suffered breathing difficulties due to the toxic fumes. Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip — territories the Palestinians want for a future state — during the Six-Day Arab-Israeli War in 1967. It later had to withdraw from Gaza. More than 600,000 Israelis live in over 230 settlements built since the 1967 occupation of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank. All the settlements are illegal under international law. The United Nations Security Council has condemned the settlement activities in several resolutions.

News article:
Israeli forces have injured dozens of Palestinians taking part in protests against Israeli settlements in several areas across the occupied West Bank. On Friday, Israeli forces suppressed a weekly anti-settlement rally in Kafr Qaddum, using rubber bullets and tear gas. Palestine's WAFA news agency cited Murad Shteiwi, a media spokesman in the Qalqilya region, as saying that four Palestinians, including a child and a journalist, were hit by rubber bullets during the attack. According to the report, tens of protesters also suffered breathing difficulties due to inhaling tear gas fired by the Israeli forces. Also on Friday, dozens of Palestinians suffered breathing difficulties as Israeli troops fired tear gas during clashes on Sobeih Mountain in the town of Beita, south of Nablus. Since May, Beita has seen intensified clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians protesting against a settlement outpost that has been established on Sobeih Mountain by settlers under the protection of Israeli forces. To the east of Nablus, several injuries were also reported as Israeli forces attacked Palestinians taking part in a peaceful anti-settlement protest in the village of Beit Dajan on Friday. Palestinian media outlets cited the Palestine Red Crescent ambulance service as saying that 15 Palestinians were hit by rubber bullets, including a volunteer with the Red Crescent, during the attack, adding that nine others suffered breathing difficulties due to the tear gas fired by Israeli troops. Meanwhile, clashes erupted in the area of Bab a-Zawiyah in the center of al-Khalil (Hebron) on Friday as the Israeli forces stationed at a military checkpoint at the entrance of al-Shuhada Street fired rubber bullets, sound bombs, and tear gas at Palestinians. The report added that tens of Palestinians suffered breathing difficulties due to the toxic fumes. Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip — territories the Palestinians want for a future state — during the Six-Day Arab-Israeli War in 1967. It later had to withdraw from Gaza. More than 600,000 Israelis live in over 230 settlements built since the 1967 occupation of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank. All the settlements are illegal under international law. The United Nations Security Council has condemned the settlement activities in several resolutions.

News article:
The US said Tuesday that it expects Israel to fully probe the death of a 78-year-old Palestinian-American man who suffered a lethal heart attack after being bound, gagged and abandoned at a construction site in the middle of winter by Israeli soldiers last month, calling for those responsible to be held fully accountable. The US statement was issued a day after the Israeli military published the findings of its internal investigation into the January 12 incident, which concluded that the soldiers “showed a clear lapse of moral judgment” and a failure to “protect the sanctity of any human life” in the death of Omar As’ad. “The United States expects a thorough criminal investigation and full accountability in this case, and we welcome receiving additional information on these efforts as soon as possible,” the statement said. “We continue to discuss this troubling incident with the Israeli government.” The State Department noted that disciplinary action was being taken by the Israeli army against the battalion commander and other officers responsible for the unit involved.

"We continue to discuss this troubling incident with the Israeli government," @StateDeptSpox says of US citizen Omar Assad's death. pic.twitter.com/J4h84Iirfq — Elizabeth Hagedorn (@ElizHagedorn) February 1, 2022 Advertisement A Military Police investigation into the As’ad’s death is ongoing. Once complete, the findings will be passed to the Military Advocate General, who will decide whether criminal charges should be filed. According to the initial IDF probe, As’ad was detained by soldiers from the Netzah Yehuda Battalion who set up an impromptu checkpoint in the central West Bank village of Jiljilya, stopping cars and checking the identification documents of people inside. The investigation found that As’ad — who refused to identify himself when asked and yelled at the soldiers — was tackled by the troops, who then bound his hands with zip ties. They then moved him to a nearby construction site, where he was left on the ground in the near-freezing January night. In order to prevent him from calling out and telling others about the checkpoint, the soldiers also gagged him, first with their hands and then by tying a strip of fabric over his mouth for a short amount of time, the probe found. Three other Palestinians were brought to the same building. When the Netzah Yehuda soldiers decided to pack up the checkpoint roughly half an hour later, they untied the four Palestinians and let them go, according to the investigation. Advertisement By that time, As’ad was unresponsive. The soldiers left him on the ground at the construction site. They later told military investigators they thought he was asleep. As’ad, an American citizen who had lived in the US for many years, was found dead a few hours later with one zip tie still around one of his hands and a blindfold over his eyes. An autopsy conducted by the Palestinian Authority and reviewed by the IDF determined that he had died of a stress-induced heart attack, brought on by being tackled to the ground, bound and gagged. As’ad had previously undergone open-heart surgery and was in poor health, according to his family. The US was quick to react to the incident shortly after it occurred, with State Department spokesman Ned Price telling reporters hours after As’ad’s death that US authorities had been in touch with his family to express condolences and offer consular assistance while also reaching out to Israel to demand clarification over what had happened. A group of Democratic lawmakers have also sounded off on As’ad’s death, demanding an investigation and expressing concern over Israeli military practices in the West Bank more broadly.

News article:
Two members of Wisconsin’s congressional delegation asked the Biden administration Monday to investigate how a Palestinian-American who lived in Milwaukee before moving back to his home village died at a West Bank checkpoint. Omar As’ad, 78, died after Israeli troops stopped him at a checkpoint in his native village of Jiljilya during the early morning hours of Jan. 12, according to family members and media reports. As’ad’s nephew, Assad Assad, said others who were detained at the checkpoint told family members that the soldiers dragged As’ad out of his car, threw him to the ground and shackled his hands and feet with zip ties, then fled after he died on the spot. The request came the same day that the Israeli military completed an internal probe that ruled that two officers will be removed from their positions immediately and a third will be formally censured over the death. The IDF’s disciplinary probe found “an ethical failure by the soldiers and a mistake in their thought process, alongside a severe violation of the value of respecting people,” the military said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The punishments against the commanders are the result of an internal disciplinary probe. A Military Police investigation into the case is ongoing, which will determine if charges will be filed against the soldiers involved. As’ad was born in Jiljilya but spent about 40 years in the United States. He became a US citizen before he returned to his home village in 2009 to retire with his wife, Nazmia, his nephew told The Associated Press. US State Department officials have said they’re seeking clarification about the events leading up to As’ad’s death. Advertisement US Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Rep. Gwen Moore sent a letter to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken asking him to launch an investigation into Assad’s death and whether the soldiers involved used equipment procured with American aid. “We strongly support human rights and the rule of law as the foundation of United States foreign policy,” Baldwin and Moore wrote. “As a Palestinian American, Mr. As’ad deserves the full protections afforded US citizens living abroad and his family deserves answers.” State Department spokesman Ned Price said Monday that he hadn’t seen the request from Baldwin and Moore and the agency hasn’t seen a final report from Israeli officials. “We continue to support an investigation that is thorough and comprehensive into the circumstances of the incident and we welcome receiving additional information as soon as possible,” Price said. Israel has occupied the West Bank since the Six Day War in 1967. Assad Assad said his uncle and aunt left Jiljilya for Chicago in 1969 in hopes of finding jobs. They moved to Milwaukee in 1974 and prospered, opening convenience stores and a restaurant, he said. They were among dozens of Jiljilya residents who have returned to the village over the years to build retirement homes, Assad Assad said. Advertisement “They built mini-castles to retire in,” he said. “Very quiet, all you see is olive trees. At night, because we’re high in the mountains, you smell the orchards of oranges.” Omar As’ad’s nephew and his son, Hane As’ad, both described Omar as a philanthropist who was the life of the party. Hane As’ad told the AP his father would often hand out money to the poor. “He just loved everybody, no matter what race you were, what culture you came from,” he said. “He just saw you as a human being.” His favorite pastimes were eating — his favorite dish was maqluba, a mix of rice and meat — and playing cards, Assad Assad said. He was coming home from playing cards with a cousin when the soldiers stopped him, he said. Hane As’ad said his mother and father were set to visit him at his home in Chesapeake, Virginia, before his father died. The family is frustrated by a lack of clear answers from the Israeli military, although they don’t expect any. Assad said his father was too old and weak to fight anyone, let alone a group of soldiers. “He was very weak,” Hane Assad said. “He walked with a cane. It takes him five minutes to get to the car, the way he walks. He doesn’t have the power of 30 soldiers . . . The military said ‘we left and he was fine.’ It doesn’t make sense.” As’ad said he’s always afraid when he returns to Jiljilya because the Israelis who operate the checkpoints are rude and disrespectful. He said he was once detained for four hours on the way to his grandmother’s funeral. The troops laugh at his American citizenship, he said. “Every time we got stopped Dad would say ‘whatever they ask for give it to them. Just be calm.’ Plenty of times we got pulled over and I never saw him fight,” Hane Assad said. “I can’t believe they did that to my dad. Almost an 80-year-old man. All the soldiers there couldn’t handle him? This is uncalled for. You don’t treat no elderly person like that.”

News article:
Israel's public security minister has called for an investigation into the Israel Police's use of hard sponge-tipped bullets against Bedouin, five of whom suffered head injuries, during protests last month over the planting of JNF trees. Public Security Minister Omer Bar-Lev asked the Justice Ministry’s police misconduct unit to investigate the cases after learning about them from a report published by the Hebrew edition of Haaretz on Sunday. >> Five Israeli bullets, five Bedouin with serious head injuries Bar-Lev told Haaretz that he was shocked by the report and that the Justice Ministry has told him that the matter is being examined. Haaretz is only aware of a single complaint filed by a victim’s family – that of Abdullah Tarabin, a 16-year-old who lost an eye after being hit by a sponge-tipped bullet.

Credit: Eliyahu Hershkovitz "Netanyahu bet everything on Trump": Inside Israel's Iran bind. LISTEN On Sunday, Joint List Knesset member Ahmad Tibi submitted a parliamentary question to Bar-Lev regarding injuries sustained by Bedouin during a demonstration on January 13, where Bedouin protested tree planting by the Jewish National Fund on land they used for farming. As reported by Haaretz, four demonstrators were injured in the upper portions of their bodies within a period of four minutes by sponge-tipped bullets. In 2000, after unrest in the Arab community resulted in the deaths of 13 Arab demonstrators and one Jewish Israeli, police use of rubber-coated bullets to disperse demonstrations was outlawed. Tibi asked why the hard sponge-tipped bullets that police are currently using shouldn’t also be outlawed. “Five head wounds in ten days, 36 in two and half years, is intentional policy, not a mistake,” Tibi told Haaretz, “the result of excessive violence, brutal repression and trigger-happiness that must be stopped, not encouraged and backed.” In June of last year, the police loosened restrictions on the use of hard sponge-tipped bullets, which replaced smaller and lighter sponge-tipped bullets that police had used in earlier years.

(Photo by Ayman Nobani/Xinhua) JERUSALEM/RAMALLAH, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel confirmed on Tuesday its forces killed three Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank during an alleged "operation to thwart a terror cell." The three men were "armed terrorists who were ... killed during clashes with the security forces," Israel's Border Police announced. Earlier in the day, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said in a statement that Israeli soldiers shot dead three Palestinian men in al-Makhfeya neighborhood in the city of Nablus. Israel's Shin Bet security service claimed in a separate statement that the three killed Palestinians were responsible for several recent shooting attacks against the Israel Defense Forces and Israeli civilians, adding that the Israeli forces suffered no casualties. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett tweeted that "those who harm us will be harmed." On the other side, Palestine called on the international community to investigate the Israeli killing, as its cabinet called on the United Nations, the human rights organizations and the international law organizations to "condemn the awful crime and act." According to a statement issued by the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an armed wing of the Fatah movement led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the three men are members of the group and "heroic martyrs." Recent weeks have seen a sharp rise in violence of Jewish settlers against the Palestinians and Palestinian property in the West Bank, as well as Palestinian attacks against Israeli forces and settlers. ■ People carry the body of one of the three Palestinians killed by Israeli forces during a funeral in the West Bank city of Nablus, on Feb. 8, 2022.

The funeral took place in the northern city of Nablus on Tuesday, hours after an Israeli special forces’ detachment killed the victims and arrested a fourth there. The incident took place in the city’s al-Makhfeya neighborhood, the official Palestinian Wafa news agency reported. The agency cited its correspondent as saying that the Israeli unit attacked the neighborhood with an unmarked civilian vehicle bearing a Palestinian number plate. The forces then started firing at another vehicle that was travelling nearby, killing three of its occupants and arresting the fourth. Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade identified the victims as the West Bank-based resistance group’s members, naming them as Ibrahim al-Nablusi, Adham Mabrouk, and Muhammed al-Dakhil. “With blood and spirit, we’ll redeem you, o martyr!” mourners chanted as they carried the bodies of the Palestinians through the streets. Videos that emerged from the funeral “recalled the bygone years of the Second Intifada (Uprising)," reports said. “Revenge! Revenge! Brigades! Qassam!” the Palestinians called out. According to the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz, the occupying regime has accused the targeted Palestinians of “several shooting attacks” over the past weeks. The West Bank-based Palestinian Authority’s health ministry called the Israeli operation "an assassination." The PA’s foreign ministry also described it as a "field execution." Reacting to the development, Hamas, the resistance movement that is headquartered in the nearby Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip, urged all Palestinian groups to stage an “intense reprisal.” “The [Israeli] enemy’s atrocity entails setting fire to the places that host Zionist servicemen and settlers,” it said in a statement. The resistance group called for mass participation in the funeral of the three Palestinians. “Let it be a march that infuriates the enemy, and sends a message that we are the righteous ones, and that resistance is our path to restore the rights that have been taken from us,” it said. Jasem al-Barghouti, one of Hamas’ officials who is based in the West Bank, meanwhile, said the atrocity proved that resistance was the only option that could protect the Palestinian nation. He slammed the PA’s “security coordination” with the Israeli regime, saying the coordination only empowered the regime to conduct more such atrocities against the Palestinians. Israel’s minister for military affairs, Benny Gantz praised the Israeli military and other participating organizations over the criminal operation, which he described as "preventive" and "proactive". The Israeli regime occupied the West Bank in a heavily-Western-backed war in 1967. Ever since, it has been dotting the territory with hundreds of illegal settlements, besides imposing the strictest of restrictions on the Palestinians’ freedom there.

News article:
Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian during clashes in the occupied West Bank late Sunday, hours after police fanned out in a tense east Jerusalem neighborhood trying to contain violence between ultranationalist Jewish activists and Palestinian residents. Early Monday, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Akram Abu Salah, 17, died from a gunshot to his head. The clashes erupted after Israeli forces rolled into Silat al-Harithiya village near Jenin to destroy homes of two Palestinian detainees accused of opening fire at a car traveling near a West Bank settlement outpost and killing a settler in December. Earlier in Jerusalem, unrest took place in Sheikh Jarrah, a flashpoint neighborhood where clashes last year helped spark an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. Dozens of Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah and other east Jerusalem neighborhoods are at risk of eviction by Jewish settler organizations, and tensions between the sides often escalate to violence. The latest unrest erupted after a settler's home was torched over the weekend. Itamar Ben-Gvir, an ultranationalist lawmaker, responded to the fire by setting up a makeshift office early Sunday near the home of a family facing possible eviction. Palestinians moved in on Ben-Gvir's tent, throwing plastic chairs in the afternoon and scuffling with his supporters. Late Sunday, riot police sprayed putrid-smelling water to break up Palestinian protests. One video on social media showed an Israeli policeman kicking a young Palestinian man. Police reported at least 12 arrests. The Palestinian Red Crescent medical service said 14 Palestinians were wounded, including four people shot with rubber bullets. Explosions from stun grenades used by police to disperse crowds could be heard during the evening. Ben-Gvir, a follower of a radical rabbi who called for the expulsion of Arabs from Israel, accused police of using "extreme brutality" against his followers. He said he would spend the night in the area "so they will learn." In addition to the threatened evictions, thousands of Palestinians live in homes in east Jerusalem that face the threat of demolition because of discriminatory policies that make it extremely difficult for Palestinians to build new homes or expand existing ones. Threatened evictions, tied up in decades-old battles between Palestinian residents and Jewish settlers, set off protests and clashes last May that helped ignite the Gaza war. Israel captured east Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. It later annexed east Jerusalem, home to the city's most sensitive holy sites, in a move that is not recognized by the international community. Israel considers the entire city to be its capital, while the Palestinians claim east Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. The city's fate is one of the most divisive issues in the century-old conflict.

News article:
A Palestinian teen was killed late Sunday in a firefight between Israeli troops and gunmen during the demolition of the home of a terror suspect near Jenin in the West Bank, the Palestinians said. Mohammad Akram Ali Taher Abu Salah, 17, died after being shot in the head by live Israeli fire, according to the Palestinian Authority Health Ministry. In a statement, the Israeli military said that troops had come under fire and that “soldiers fired at several armed [Palestinians] who they identified at the scene.” According to the Palestinian Red Crescent, four Palestinians were wounded during the clashes. The army said troops had come under fire, in addition to having rocks and Molotov cocktails thrown at the soldiers at several positions inside the village during the Sunday night raid. According to the Palestine Today channel, which is affiliated with Islamic Jihad, the terror group’s armed wing — the Al-Quds Brigades — was behind the shooting attack on the IDF troops. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “The Jenin Battalion executed several shooting attacks tonight targeting the occupation army and causing injuries among its ranks,” the Al-Quds Brigades said in a statement put out by Palestine Today.

Israeli authorities have charged Jaradat, along with three other Palestinians, in the killing of Yehuda Dimentman, 25, in a deadly West Bank terror shooting in mid-December. Israel demolishes the homes of Palestinians accused of carrying out deadly terror attacks as a matter of policy. The efficacy of the policy is controversial even within the Israeli security services and human rights activists have denounced it as unfair collective punishment. Dimentman was killed as he left a yeshiva at the Homesh outpost where he studied. Homesh was evacuated in 2005 following the withdrawal from Gaza and some West Bank settlements. While Israeli law bans resettling at Homesh, the army has tolerated the presence of the yeshiva for over a decade and a half. The area has also been the site of repeated clashes between the outpost’s hard-right Jewish settlers and local Palestinians. Tensions have been rising across the West Bank over the past few months. December and January saw repeated “lone wolf” attacks, with Palestinians seeking to stab or run over Israelis. The army also reported several incidents in which bursts of gunfire struck military posts, without any casualties. Advertisement Last Tuesday, Israeli undercover police killed three Palestinians during a rare daytime raid in the West Bank city of Nablus. The Israeli troops fired dozens of rounds into the car before seizing two M-16 rifles from the vehicle and driving away from the scene. Israeli defense officials accused the three of being behind in the string of recent shooting attacks. They were later claimed as members by the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, a loose coalition of armed groups affiliated with the ruling Fatah party.

News article:
Israeli forces have shot and killed a Palestinian youth in the occupied West Bank village of Nabi Saleh during a fresh Palestinian rally in support of the residents of the flashpoint neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah in al-Quds. The Palestinian Health Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that the Palestinian was killed by Israeli fire during clashes that erupted in Nabi Saleh, northwest of Ramallah City, between protesters and Israeli troops. Residents identified the victim as Nehad Bargouthi, 19, who was shot in the abdomen with live bullets and was taken to the hospital before succumbing to his wounds. Local witnesses said the shooting was "cold-blooded" and with no justification. Bargouthi's killing comes a day after Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian teenage boy and wounded at least 14 others during fierce skirmishes in Silat al-Harithiya Village, northwest of Jenin. Those clashes broke out as Israeli troops raided the village to tear down a home. The Israeli regime keeps up its arrest and demolition spree across the occupied West Bank, amid ongoing clashes between regime forces and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah. Reporting on Tuesday, the Quds News Network, which is based in the occupied Palestinian territories, said the forces had arrested as many as 18 Palestinians across the territories over the past 24 hours. This comes as the European Union (EU) on Monday demanded an end to the violent clashes between Israeli military forces and the Palestinian residents of Sheikh Jarrah. Tensions heightened across the Palestinian territories on Sunday, when Israeli forces and illegal settlers renewed their attacks against the Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah, located in occupied East al-Quds. Sheikh Jarrah has been the scene of frequent crackdowns by Israeli regime forces on the Palestinians protesting against the threatened expulsion of dozens of families from their homes in favor of Israeli settler groups. Since Israel seized East al-Quds in a 1967 war, Israeli settler organizations have claimed ownership of land in Sheikh Jarrah and have been attempting to evict Palestinians from the area. This is while most of the international community considers the Israeli settlement structures to be illegal under international law due to their construction on occupied territory.

News article:
Dozens of Palestinians have been injured by Israeli forces in the flashpoint town of Beita, near the occupied West Bank city of Nablus as clashes erupted after Israeli settlers stormed the area. According to the Palestine Red Crescent, nearly 90 Palestinians, including four journalists, were injured during clashes with Israeli forces in the vicinity of Sobeih Mountain in Beita, south of Nablus, on Friday. The injured included at least 57 people who suffered breathing difficulties due to inhaling tear gas fired by the Israeli troops, and five others who were hit with rubber bullets used by the forces. Ja’far Shtayyeh was identified as one of the journalists who were injured while covering the clashes. Media outlets reported that the clashes erupted on Friday at dawn as Israeli forces attacked the Palestinians who were protesting a visit by a group of Israeli settlers to the area. Israeli forces had earlier razed roads that led to Sobeih Mountain in a bid to block the Palestinians from reaching the area. Footage circulated on social media on Friday, showing Palestinians hurling stones at Israeli bulldozers during the clashes, which also saw arrests. Since May, Beita has seen intensified clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians protesting against a settlement outpost that has been established on Sobeih Mountain by settlers under the protection of Israeli forces. To the east of Nablus, clashes erupted between Israeli forces and Palestinians in the village of Beit Dajan, leaving 16 Palestinians injured. Also on Friday, Israeli forces suppressed a weekly anti-settlement rally in the village of Kafr Qaddum in Qalqilya Province on Friday. Murad Shteiwi, a media spokesman in the Qalqilya region, said the Israeli forces opened fire on the protesters, injuring a 12-year-old boy. Palestinian media reports said scores of Palestinians also suffered breathing difficulties due to inhaling tear gas fired by the Israeli forces. Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip — territories the Palestinians want for a future state — during the Six-Day Arab-Israeli War in 1967. It later had to withdraw from Gaza. More than 600,000 Israelis live in over 230 settlements built since the 1967 occupation of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank. All the settlements are illegal under international law. The United Nations Security Council has condemned the settlement activities in several resolutions.

More than 600,000 Israelis live in over 230 settlements built since the 1967 occupation of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank. All the settlements are illegal under international law. The United Nations Security Council has condemned the settlement activities in several resolutions.

Dozens of Palestinians have been injured by Israeli forces in the flashpoint town of Beita, near the occupied West Bank city of Nablus as clashes erupted after Israeli settlers stormed the area. According to the Palestine Red Crescent, nearly 90 Palestinians, including four journalists, were injured during clashes with Israeli forces in the vicinity of Sobeih Mountain in Beita, south of Nablus, on Friday. The injured included at least 57 people who suffered breathing difficulties due to inhaling tear gas fired by the Israeli troops, and five others who were hit with rubber bullets used by the forces. Ja’far Shtayyeh was identified as one of the journalists who were injured while covering the clashes. Media outlets reported that the clashes erupted on Friday at dawn as Israeli forces attacked the Palestinians who were protesting a visit by a group of Israeli settlers to the area. Israeli forces had earlier razed roads that led to Sobeih Mountain in a bid to block the Palestinians from reaching the area. Footage circulated on social media on Friday, showing Palestinians hurling stones at Israeli bulldozers during the clashes, which also saw arrests. Since May, Beita has seen intensified clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians protesting against a settlement outpost that has been established on Sobeih Mountain by settlers under the protection of Israeli forces. To the east of Nablus, clashes erupted between Israeli forces and Palestinians in the village of Beit Dajan, leaving 16 Palestinians injured. Also on Friday, Israeli forces suppressed a weekly anti-settlement rally in the village of Kafr Qaddum in Qalqilya Province on Friday. Murad Shteiwi, a media spokesman in the Qalqilya region, said the Israeli forces opened fire on the protesters, injuring a 12-year-old boy. Palestinian media reports said scores of Palestinians also suffered breathing difficulties due to inhaling tear gas fired by the Israeli forces. Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip — territories the Palestinians want for a future state — during the Six-Day Arab-Israeli War in 1967. It later had to withdraw from Gaza.

A Palestinian teen was shot dead by Israeli troops Tuesday night while allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails at passing cars near the West Bank city of Bethlehem. Palestinian Authority health officials identified the deceased as Muhammad Shahada, 14, a resident of al-Khader, near Bethlehem. Israeli soldiers provided him with first aid on the scene, but he died of his injuries shortly thereafter, the Israeli army said. Israeli soldiers ambushed “three Palestinian suspects” throwing firebombs at a spot near al-Khader, the army said Israelis traveling along the area’s main traffic artery, Route 60, have repeatedly been attacked with Molotov cocktails at the juncture in recent weeks. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The Israel Defense Forces said the three suspects, including Shahada, were responsible for a string of local firebomb attacks. ”The troops fired at one of the suspects while he threw a Molotov cocktail, and hit him,” the IDF said in a statement. Former Khader town mayor Adnan Sbeih said he heard the shooting and rushed out of his home, which lies on the outskirts of the town near the scene of the ambush. Advertisement The Israeli security barrier separates al-Khader from Route 60 and Sbeih and others noted that Shahada was shot on the al-Khader side of the wall, disputing whether he actually posed a risk to motorists. “The child was maybe 100 meters from the wall. But the army seemed to have fired from much closer. It seemed like the army had prepared an ambush on this side of the wall,” Sbeih said in a phone call. Ahmad Salah, Muhammad’s cousin, told The Times of Israel that he believed Shahada was nowhere near close enough to the wall to threaten Israelis — “even if we assume that he was throwing Molotov cocktails.” He pointed to a video from the scene which showed soldiers giving first aid in what appeared to be a courtyard between homes. “You can see in the videos that he’s still within the houses [of the village]. People filmed from their homes through the windows — that’s not next to the wall,” claimed Salah. ???? الاحتلال يطلق النار صوب شاب في بلدة الخضر ببت لحم ويصيبه بشكل مباشر قبل اعتقاله pic.twitter.com/35Fg8rGklK Advertisement — وكالة شهاب للأنباء (@ShehabAgency) February 22, 2022 The West Bank has seen a rise in violent confrontations between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians in recent weeks.

The Israeli troops fired dozens of rounds into the car before seizing two M-16 rifles from the vehicle and driving away from the scene. Israeli defense officials said the three were behind a string of recent shooting attacks on military posts. They were later claimed as members by the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, a loose coalition of armed groups affiliated with the ruling Fatah party.

An Israeli citizen was shot dead as a convoy he was traveling in outside Kyiv came under fire, apparently by Ukrainian troops who mistook him for a Chechen militant. The man’s family identified him as Roman Brodsky, a father of two and DJ who had been living in Ukraine with his family. He was the first Israeli citizen reported killed in the Russian onslaught against Ukraine, which Moscow launched last Thursday. The Foreign Ministry said Brodsky was part of a convoy of vehicles traveling to the Moldovan border to leave the country. He and his partner were intending to then fly to Israel. According to Brodsky’s father, his son was shot dead at a checkpoint.

Despite Ukrainian soldiers shooting Brodsky, his family told the Channel 12 news outlet that they blame the “dictator” Vladimir Putin for his death. His father told the station that they want help bringing him for burial in Israel, and asked that Israel do more to ensure that people who are still alive can make it safely to the Jewish state. Brodsky came to Israel at age 13 with his family. He lived in the country for 27 years and had two small children. He returned to Ukraine about 2 years ago to start a business in Kyiv.

Prime Minister Naftali Bennett sent condolences to the family on Monday evening. “In the name of all Israeli citizens, I want to send my condolences to Roman’s wife, children and family in Israel and in Ukraine. We are doing everything to help Israelis return home,” Bennett said. The Foreign Ministry said it had informed the man’s wife and child who were still in Ukraine, as well as his parents in Israel. His mother collapsed upon hearing the news and was taken to Ashkelon’s Barzilai Medical Center for care. Brodsky’s father and stepmother live in the southern city of Arad, while his mother lives in Ashkelon. They were informed of their son’s death by Magen David Adom.

Two Palestinians were killed in a firefight with Israeli troops near the West Bank city of Jenin early Tuesday morning. The Israel Police said undercover Border Police officers came under fire while arresting a terror suspect in the Jenin refugee camp. The suspect, Emad Abu al-Heija, is the son of imprisoned senior Hamas official Jamal Abu al-Heija. Palestinian media identified the two fatalities as 19-year-old Shadi Najm, and 22-year-old Abdullah al-Housri. The Islamic Jihad terror group immediately claimed al-Housri as a member. Masked gunmen affiliated with Islamic Jihad’s armed wing in Jenin published a menacing video after al-Housri’s death, vowing revenge. “Let the criminal enemy know that his soldiers and checkpoints and military will know no safety,” one of the gunmen said, reading out a prepared statement.

There were no casualties among Israeli forces, police said, and the suspect was arrested.

Images showed al-Housri’s body wrapped in the flag of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, as well as the terror group’s logo on his firearm.

Witnesses who spoke to the Haaretz daily said al-Najm was unarmed. The West Bank has seen a rise in violent confrontations between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians in recent weeks. Last week, a Palestinian teen was shot dead by Israeli troops while allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails at passing cars on Route 60 near Bethlehem. A week before that a 19-year-old was shot and killed near Nebi Saleh after allegedly throwing firebombs at a military post, although Palestinian witnesses dispute the matter.

The troops had arrived after dark to demolish part of a home belonging to a Palestinian charged in a terror attack in which yeshiva student Yehuda Dimentman was killed near the Homesh outpost in December. Israeli undercover police killed three other Palestinians during a rare daytime raid in the West Bank city of Nablus last month. The Israeli troops fired dozens of rounds into the car before seizing two M-16 rifles from the vehicle and driving away from the scene. Israeli defense officials said the three were behind a string of recent shooting attacks on military posts in the Jenin area. They were later claimed as members by the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, a loose coalition of armed groups affiliated with the ruling Fatah party. Aaron Boxerman contributed to this report.

There were no casualties among Israeli forces, police said, and the suspect was arrested. Later, as the officers left the refugee camp, dozens of Palestinians hurled stones, Molotov cocktails, and a makeshift grenade at the officers, who responded with “riot dispersal means and live fire,” police said. Images showed al-Housri’s body wrapped in the flag of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, as well as the terror group’s logo on his firearm.

Witnesses who spoke to the Haaretz daily said al-Najm was unarmed. The West Bank has seen a rise in violent confrontations between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians in recent weeks. Last week, a Palestinian teen was shot dead by Israeli troops while allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails at passing cars on Route 60 near Bethlehem. A week before that a 19-year-old was shot and killed near Nebi Saleh after allegedly throwing firebombs at a military post, although Palestinian witnesses dispute the matter. Advertisement Another Palestinian teen was killed that week during a firefight between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians in the town of Silat al-Harithiya, near Jenin. The troops had arrived after dark to demolish part of a home belonging to a Palestinian charged in a terror attack in which yeshiva student Yehuda Dimentman was killed near the Homesh outpost in December. Israeli undercover police killed three other Palestinians during a rare daytime raid in the West Bank city of Nablus last month. The Israeli troops fired dozens of rounds into the car before seizing two M-16 rifles from the vehicle and driving away from the scene. Israeli defense officials said the three were behind a string of recent shooting attacks on military posts in the Jenin area. They were later claimed as members by the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, a loose coalition of armed groups affiliated with the ruling Fatah party. Aaron Boxerman contributed to this report.

Amid clashes in the northern West Bank, a Palestinian who hurled a Molotov cocktail at troops was shot at, a military spokesperson says. According to the IDF, some 20 Palestinians hurled stones at soldiers and set tires on fire near the village of Burqa. “One of the suspects approached the troops and threw a Molotov cocktail at them. The troops responded with gunfire,” the spokesperson says. The official Palestinian Authority news agency WAFA says the man was seriously hurt and taken to a hospital in Nablus. The military is aware of this claim. Three Palestinians have been killed today in separate incidents. Ammar Shafiq Abu Afifa, 21, was shot dead near the settlement of Migdal Oz under unclear circumstances, and 19-year-old Shadi al-Najm and 22-year-old Abdullah al-Housri were killed during a gunbattle near Jenin early this morning.

News article:
U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Dorothy Shea on Friday met with Prime Minister Najib Miqati and conveyed to him “an official written communication from the U.S. Department of the Treasury” that she said “answers to some of the concerns that the (Lebanese) authorities have” regarding regional energy deals. ”They wanted to make sure that in pursuing the regional energy deals that the United States has been helping to facilitate between Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan, that there will be no concerns with U.S. sanctions legislation,” Shea said after the talks. “This letter that was delivered represents forward momentum and important milestone as we continue to make progress to bring safer, cleaner, more reliable energy solutions to help address the energy crisis that the Lebanese people have been experiencing,” the ambassador added. In late December, Lebanon's energy minister launched two projects in the country's north to facilitate the flow of natural gas from Egypt. The move aims to improve electricity production and expand the country's tanks to increase oil reserves. The revival of the Arab Gas Pipeline to deliver Egyptian gas to Lebanon comes as the small country is reeling from a crippling electricity crisis. The pipeline has been out of service in Lebanon since before Syria's 10-year conflict began in 2011. Minister Walid Fayad said Egypt's Technical Gas Services would begin renovation work on the pipeline inside Lebanon and work should be done in a little more than two months. Egypt has agreed to supply Lebanon with natural gas to its power plants through Jordan and Syria. Syrian experts have finished work inside the war-torn country. The Syrian government is under U.S. and Western sanctions for its role in the war. Despite the sanctions, the U.S. has supported the resumption of natural gas flow from Egypt to Lebanon via Syria. Fayyad told The Associated Press during a tour of an oil facility that U.S. officials who have visited Lebanon said the contract to bring gas from Egypt will not be targeted by sanctions because "no cash is going from any side to Syria." He added that Egyptian officials are in contact with the Americans to make sure that the contract does not violate the sanctions. Fayyad said about 650 million cubic meters (22.95 billion cubic feet) of gas will be brought to Lebanon through the pipeline annually to the Deir Ammar power station in the north. He said the amount will lead to the production of 450 megawatts of electricity adding three to four hours of electricity supplies a day. He said the cost will be about 7.5 to 8 cents per kilowatt hour, "which is cheaper than any production costs we have." In 2019, Lebanon signed a deal with Russia's largest oil company, Rosneft, to upgrade and operate storage installations in Tripoli. The deal made Rosneft manage storage operations. Fayad said Roseneft will rehabilitate and build tanks that can fit 150,000 cubic meters (5.29 million cubic feet) of strategic storage and at a later stage it can reach 250,000 cubic meters (8.82 million cubic feet). Eventually it will fit 400,000 cubic meters (14.1 million cubic feet). He said the works will begin with the renovation of three tanks and building three new ones as well adding that the project is expected to take about 18 months.

News article:
Time to end Hezbollah’s hold over Lebanon Osama Al-Sharif Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, President Michel Aoun and PM Saad Al-Hariri attend a graduation ceremony for officer cadets, Fayadyeh, 2017. (Reuters) Short Url https://arab.news/nx6sb For decades, the sectarian power-sharing understanding between Lebanon’s warlords, who became the faces of its ruling political elite, was a marriage of convenience that allowed each to claim a slice of the country’s lucrative economic cake. That understanding, the Taif Agreement, provided a period of economic recovery after years of civil war. Thus, while the political elite enjoyed the economic windfall, leaving enough for their respective sects to survive and endure, the system itself, imperfect as it is, kept going on thanks to its sheer momentum. That is until one party to the deal decided to change the rules and claim a wider share, or what became known as the disruptive vote in any government. Hezbollah’s rise came by accident. Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982, in collaboration with Christian militias led by the Kataeb Party, and the ensuing series of events that culminated with the expulsion of the Palestinian Liberation Organization from the country finally led, in 1985, to the emergence on the scene of Hezbollah, with Iran’s solid backing. Back then, Hezbollah had a just cause: To rid Lebanon of Israeli occupation. Along with its fellow Shiite partner Amal, it fought Israel and finally drove it out of Southern Lebanon in 2000. And when the civil war ended in 1990, Hezbollah refused to disarm while Israel was still occupying parts of the country. That was a milestone in the evolution of the party as an armed militia within the Lebanese state. And that reality remained a major challenge — if not an impediment — for successive Lebanese governments. The sectarian power-sharing deal had become skewed. Hezbollah became a major political player because it had infiltrated key state institutions. Slowly but surely, its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, began identifying himself as a regional player with unabashed fealty to the agenda of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. It is no wonder that the paralysis that hit Lebanon’s political system was followed by economic collapse. Lebanon became hostage to the man ruling from Beirut’s southern district. He dragged the country into a devastating war in 2006 and admitted he was wrong. But his apology was not a remorseful one. He became more defiant as he built an arsenal of Iranian missiles that he threatened to launch at Israel, even though a war of that sort would surely destroy what is left of Lebanon. In May 2008, after a long political stalemate, Hezbollah’s forces briefly overtook Beirut to pin down their Sunni foes. The message was clear to all: Hezbollah had become a state within a state and it now manipulated the sectarian agenda to bring down the government whenever it pleased. Its alliance with the Christian Free Patriotic Movement, led by President Michel Aoun, proved to be unholy in all aspects. To serve narrow political objectives, Aoun allowed Hezbollah to derail the political process on more than one occasion, leading to the mass civil protests in 2019. From then on, Lebanon went into a downward spiral. And the plunge continues. Setting aside the alleged involvement of Hezbollah in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005, the explosion that destroyed Beirut’s port in August 2020 complicated things for the group. Lebanon’s political crisis deepened when a judge was appointed to investigate the incident. Hezbollah and Amal objected and wanted the file closed. Aside from the huge economic losses to the port and property — estimated at $15 billion — the explosion killed 218 civilians and injured more than 7,000. A month after joining Najib Mikati’s newly formed government last September, ministers belonging to the two Shiite groups began a boycott of the Cabinet over the port explosion investigation. The lira has since lost almost 90 percent of its value, putting 80 percent of the Lebanese population below the poverty line. To make things worse, Nasrallah launched an irresponsible and unwarranted verbal attack on Saudi Arabia, a country hosting no less than 150,000 Lebanese expatriates. The diplomatic backlash from Gulf Cooperation Council countries was severe and Beirut found itself politically and economically isolated. The leaders of Hezbollah and Amal have abandoned their Lebanese identity and brought the whole country to its knees. Osama Al-Sharif Now, Hezbollah and Amal have announced that their ministers are ending the Cabinet boycott for the sake of passing the 2022 budget and alleviating the economic crisis. This is yet another ploy to tighten Hezbollah’s grip on the government. The bitter fact is that the two groups’ leaderships have abandoned their Lebanese identity and brought the whole country to its knees. The end of the boycott could be related to news that the West and Iran are closer than ever to reaching a deal in Vienna. Hezbollah might be feeling that Iran’s regional priorities are about to change. Whatever the reason, Hezbollah has become a burden on Lebanon’s tired back. Even in a sectarian power-sharing understanding — one that has become anathema for most Lebanese — the group is claiming much more than its fair share. Going back to business as usual is no longer an option for Lebanon. A new deal must be struck; one that replaces the sectarian power-sharing system with an equitable arrangement that recognizes a single Lebanese national identity and that ends the two-decade hijack of the state by Hezbollah.

News article:
Lebanon is ready to resume talks over a maritime border dispute with Israel, the country’s president, Michel Aoun, said on Wednesday. Longtime foes Israel and Lebanon have no diplomatic relations and are technically in a state of war. They each claim about 860 square kilometers (330 square miles) of the Mediterranean Sea as being within their exclusive economic zones. The two countries started indirect negotiations through a US mediator in 2020 at a UN peacekeeping base in Lebanon’s Naqoura, but the talks have stalled several times. The last round of talks on the matter was held last May. Lebanon has sunk deep into an economic and financial crisis that started in late 2019 — a culmination of decades of corruption and mismanagement by the political class. The small Mediterranean country is eager to resolve its border dispute with Israel, paving the way for potential lucrative oil and gas deals. Israel’s Energy Ministry said in response that it is ready to resume talks, with Israeli officials quoted by the Kan public broadcaster as saying, “For us, the negotiations never been stopped. But Lebanon must stop raising new demands.” Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms US envoy Amos Hochstein — appointed by President Joe Biden to oversee the talks — will arrive in Israel next week to meet with Energy Minister Karine Elharrar and other officials, the Walla news site reported Wednesday. In November, the Axios news site reported that Hochstein informed Israel and Lebanon that if they could not agree to a compromise, he would end his involvement in the talks. He suggested to top Israeli officials during a visit to Israel that they need to get the deal done before the March 2022 parliamentary election in Lebanon, the report quoted Israeli officials as saying. Advertisement Hochstein was also in Beirut a month earlier as he continued his efforts to restart the stalled talks. The Israel-born envoy also told officials that he was not planning to resume the joint talks held at a UN base on the border. Instead, he would meet with each side independently and then offer a bridging proposal. “Hochstein told us he is not going to present a proposal that both sides like, but the opposite — that both won’t like. But if three to four months from now he sees the parties are not willing to take the deal, he would drop the whole thing and won’t deal with this anymore,” a senior Israeli official told Axios. Hochstein was looking to get both sides to make serious compromises, officials said, noting that both countries wanted to resolve the dispute despite tensions between them. In October, the leader of Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah terror group, Hassan Nasrallah, warned Israel against unilaterally searching for natural gas in the disputed maritime region before any agreement is reached. In a wide-ranging speech broadcast from an undisclosed location during a ceremony marking Prophet Muhammad’s birthday, Nasrallah said that while he would leave it up to the Lebanese government to negotiate an end to the dispute, his group would not tolerate Israeli searches in the disputed region. Advertisement Accusing Israel of casting a “greedy” eye over Lebanon’s natural resources, the terror leader said Israel was “mistaken if it thought it could extract these resources from the disputed area before negotiations are completed.” “The resistance is capable of acting and will do so against any Israeli actions in the disputed zone,” Nasrallah said, accusing Israel of giving a company the go-ahead to begin explorations.

Lebanese President Michel Aoun declared on Wednesday that his country was prepared to restart indirect negotiations with Israel over the two countries’ maritime borders. According to Israel’s Kan news, Israel responded to the announcement by saying that “for us, the negotiations have never been stopped. But Lebanon must stop raising new demands.” Aoun’s comments on restarting negotiations regarding the demarcation of international boundaries on the Mediterranean Sea were made to the U.N. mission in Lebanon, according to I24. Aoun stressed that the drafting of these borders must be done “in a way that preserves Lebanon’s sovereignty.” The report noted that American mediator Amos Hochstein will meet in Israel next week with Energy Minister Karine Elharrar.

News article:
Lebanon is at a crucial crossroads as its government finally convenes for the first time in several months. It will have little time to negotiate a reform package with the International Monetary Fund to avoid economic collapse. And while the Shiite duo of the Amal movement and Hezbollah recently made headlines by ending their three-month boycott of cabinet sessions, thus allowing the government to convene, this is no assurance that they will not continue to meddle with Lebanese lawmakers to derail any reform package that is needed to begin rebuilding. Right now, the Lebanese people are suffering; many are starving and rightfully distrustful that the government will come to their assistance. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and Internal Security Forces (ISF) are experiencing challenges in carrying out their missions, which could create regional problems if Lebanon’s security and sovereignty are not protected. How the United States responds to these troubles can play a pivotal role in helping to stabilize one of the few liberal democratic states in the Arab world. Lebanon’s collapse would end the many assets it brings to the Middle East: counterterrorism cooperation with the U.S., an inclusive democracy, religious coexistence, gender equality, and access to Western education (especially the two leading American universities in the Middle East). Increased Iranian influence in Lebanon could lead to the country’s loss of sovereignty and independence and likely would result in a growing terror threat to the U.S. There is no looking the other way; the US must act. A new policy brief released by the American Task Force on Lebanon, the Middle East Institute and more than 20 leading policymakers makes the case that friends of the U.S. and Lebanon in the international community can play a critical role in encouraging Lebanese politicians to put the Lebanese people first when setting policy, and not their personal interests. The traditional political parties abet corruption and oppose inclusive reforms; others, such as Amal and Hezbollah, also have disruptive agendas. Together, this makes it nearly impossible for Judge Tarek Bitar to conduct an independent investigation into the Aug. 4, 2020, Beirut Port explosion, and undermines the judiciary and other state institutions that protect democracy in Lebanon. The first challenge for the U.S. and its allies is to promote the integrity of parliamentary elections on May 15. Results of the election should reflect the needs of Lebanon’s people for economic progress, a significant social safety net, transparent government, and a program for eliminating government corruption. This is a call not merely for younger leadership, but for leaders with a nonsectarian mentality whose allegiance starts and ends with Lebanon. New candidates and political parties will appear on the ballot, and it is vital that they have the opportunity to make their case to voters. The U.S. should join an international effort to provide election monitors and assistance to civil society organizations that promote democracy and clean government. Anyone who interferes in this election should be sanctioned or otherwise punished. The U.S. also should use its influence and leadership with countries such as France and the Gulf states to help combat corruption and promote reform in Lebanon. This will ensure that the Lebanese people have reliable foreign partners and the resources to withstand nefarious efforts made by countries such as Iran and Syria. A positive step is to advance the maritime border negotiations with Israel, which will remove an area of provocations between Lebanon and Israel. The U.S. must continue to play a leadership role that ensures conditions for fruitful talks. Importantly, the U.S. also must understand that any agreement it makes with Iran must impose a requirement for Iran to control — and eventually eliminate — its terrorist proxies in the Middle East, such as Hezbollah. Lastly, the depth of Lebanon’s economic crisis cannot be overstated. The Mikati government must quickly adopt a national budget and complete negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for an agreement that is fair to bank depositors, initiates banking and public sector reforms, and creates opportunities for businesses to grow and create employment. The Lebanese people deserve to live in a sovereign, independent state that is not threatened by internal militias, terrorists or neighboring countries, and the U.S. cannot afford to have Lebanon become a failed state. The elections must happen in a fair and transparent manner. Support for the LAF and ISF must increase. Reforms must begin. The potential erosion of Lebanon’s integrity as a state would be a tragic loss of a longtime U.S. friend and could further undermine American credibility in the region.

News article:
Beirut - Asharq Al-Awsat The repeated attacks against the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) are political messages from Hezbollah and Iran to the UN and international community. Three attacks against the peacekeeping force were reported in one month alone. Never have there been this many attacks against the international troops in the space of one month. The attacks took place amid international calls that the Iran-backed Hezbollah party lay down its arms and for Lebanon to implement UN Security Council resolution 1701 and 1559. UNIFIL has, meanwhile, taken a firmer stance against these assaults, more so than it has ever done before. In a sharp tone, it demanded that the perpetrator be held to account, calling on the Lebanese authorities to carry out a probe. This marked a shift in its tone as UNIFIL usually used to announce an investigation in such attacks and that it was coordinating with the Lebanese military. Resolution 1701 was issued in August 2006 to end the Israeli war on Lebanon. It gave UNIFIL the jurisdiction to carry out the necessary security measures in areas where it is deployed in southern Lebanon. Among other points, the resolution demands that areas of UNIFIL's deployment are not used for hostile attacks of any kind. The resolution provides protection for UN facilities and employees, guarantees their freedom of movement in humanitarian work and protects civilians, while respecting the role of the Lebanese government. The resolution effectively expanded the role of UNIFIL, which was first formed and deployed in Lebanon in 1978. Since then, the UN troops have been deploying at least 400 patrols a day. The troops have rarely come under attack and when they do, they usually happen before their mandate is extended in August of every year. Political and field changes must have happened for three attacks to take place against UNIFIL in one month. In November alone, three assaults were reported against the troops. One attack was reported in the town of Shakra on December 24, another in the town of Ramia on December 25 and the third in Bint Jbeil on January 3. Often, "locals" are blamed for attacking UNIFIL. 'Locals' and Hezbollah Lebanese academic and political researcher Dr. Mona Fayad rejects accusations that "locals" are behind these attacks. In remarks to Asharq Al-Awsat, she said that such excuses are "not fooling anyone." Rather, she said Hezbollah, which is "hiding behind the people", should be held responsible. She said the party has managed over time to establish an authority that is independent of the Lebanese state. One of the ways it managed to reach this position is its assuming of the role of "speaking on behalf of the resistance community and labeling as 'locals' people, especially Shiites, whom it mobilizes whenever the party needs them to exert pressure on a certain side. That way the party avoids direct confrontation." Political motives The frequency of the recent attacks has raised questions over their motives and political messages to the international mission. UNIFIL was firm in demanding a probe into the attacks, rejecting attempts aimed at restricting its freedom of movement in the South. Fayad noted the latest attack when a routine UNIFIL patrol was assaulted even though it did not veer off its main route. Past attacks have been blamed on patrols changing their routes without coordinating with the Lebanese army or on troops taking photos in specific locations. Fayad said the latest attacks are taking place at a time when the residents of the South feel that they need UN troops given the security and peace they have established in the area since the implementation of resolution 1701. Prior to that, they had never experienced such peace and calm, she added. At a time of upheaval in the rest of the country in recent years, the South has enjoyed relative calm, with the assassination of Shiite dissident Loqman Slim last year as the only major incident. He was killed in the South, in an area that is filled with surveillance cameras and where Hezbollah must be very familiar with. Hezbollah, continued Fayad, has exploited the "army, resistance and people" slogan to exert pressure on various sides, while still avoiding turning attention to it. Indeed, Hezbollah is not mentioned when attacks on UNIFIL are reported, but rather the "locals" are the ones being blamed. The party uses such tactics to give the impression that it is implementing resolution 1701. Change in UNIFIL's tone After the latest attack on January 25, UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti said the peacekeepers were not trespassing on private property, but were passing through a routine route. They were carrying out their duties according to resolution 1701 to preserve stability in the South. He stressed that the resolution grants the troops complete freedom of movement and the right to deploy patrols in their area of operations. The attacks against the men and women who are serving peace are deemed as crimes by Lebanese and international laws. The Lebanese authorities must probe these crimes and put the perpetrators on trial, he demanded. Tenenti's statements mark a shift in tone. Fayad said the peacekeepers will no longer accept the excuse that the attacks were sparked by them changing their patrol route or that they were taking photos. The change in the spokesperson's tone is a sign that the confrontation is growing because the UN mission senses a shift in the equation and an opportunity for it to play a better role, she explained. Furthermore, Fayad said these changes "are not restricted to Lebanon alone," but they are tied to the Vienna nuclear talks with Iran. International messages Political researcher and retired Gen. of Staff Khaled Hamade said the timing of the attacks are more significant than the assaults themselves. There is no doubt that Hezbollah is behind the attacks, which are tied to regional developments, Hamade told Asharq Al-Awsat. The developments point to significant changes on the ground in the region. Iran is seeking to use its regional cards in response to its setbacks in the region, he explained. Iran, not Hezbollah, should be blamed for the attacks on UNIFIL because the party is an extension of Tehran in Lebanon. Iran is seeking to "shuffle all regional cards," said Hamade. He cited the developments in Iraq that is stumbling in forming a new government. He also noted the attempt on the life of Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi. He pointed to the repeated rocket attacks on the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia by the Iran-backed Houthi militias in Yemen. These are all signs of Iran's reactions in regions where it wields influence, stressed Hamade. Moreover, the attack carried out by ISIS against Gweiran prison in northeastern Syria is "one of the cards Iran is using to exert pressure in the region." Lebanon is another one of Iran's cards and it is using UNIFIL to deliver messages. Hamade said Tehran is using all the cards at its disposal in reaction to the setbacks it has suffered. In Lebanon, Hezbollah does Iran's bidding by attacking UNIFIL. By attacking UNIFIL, Iran is saying that it can obstruct the implementation of resolution 1701, explained Hamade. Lebanon is helpless in responding to or thwarting such a violation, so the government often takes a very vague stance that does nothing in affecting the situation on the ground. UN cover Meanwhile, fears have been growing in the South that the attacks would force UNIFIL to pull out of Lebanon, which would cost the country one of its last remaining international covers as it grapples with an unprecedented economic crisis. Hamade eased these concerns, saying the peacekeeping force will remain. The attacks will not force UNIFIL to withdraw, but the repeated incidents will prompt international reactions, perhaps even a Security Council meeting. "The Council will not be extorted and will not allow the obstruction of an international resolution," he stated. "Furthermore, Hezbollah itself does not want the UN troops to withdraw because it will lose a precious card in its extortion." Another factor is Israel, said Hamade. It wants an international force deployed in the South because it ensures its security. Iran itself also wants UNIFIL to stay so that it can continue on delivering its messages. Hezbollah wants the troops to remain so that it can keep its attention focused on internal Lebanese affairs, added Hamade. It will continue to abide by resolution 1701, implementing it "with an Iranian twist and a way that serves its interests."

News article:
President Michel Aoun on Monday asked Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib to file a U.N. Security Council complaint against Israel over its violation of Lebanon’s airspace to carry out an overnight strike on Syria. Aoun made the request during a Cabinet session in Baabda, in which Interior Minister Bassam al-Mawlawi briefed the conferees on the busting of “17 spy networks that were working for the Israeli enemy” inside Lebanon. “It turned out that the role of these networks is domestic and regional,” Mawlawi told Cabinet. Prime Minister Najib Miqati for his part hailed “the Intelligence Branch of the Internal Security Forces over this major achievement.” “Busting these networks once again proves the importance of preemptive security and strong coordination among the various security agencies concerned with protecting Lebanon,” the premier added. Al-Akhbar newspaper reported the busts on Monday, calling it the largest operation against suspected Israeli agents in the country for 13 years. It said that the ISF's intelligence unit started the crackdown four weeks ago and had so far detained around 20 people, including Lebanese, Palestinian and Syrian nationals -- some of whom were later released. The al-Akhbar report claimed that at least 12 of the suspects in detention were aware they working for Israel, while the rest believed they were providing information for global companies or non profit organizations. Israel and Hizbullah fought a 33-day war in Lebanon in 2006. Between April 2009 and 2014, Lebanese authorities detained more than 100 people accused of spying for Israel, most of them members of the military or telecom employees. The rate of arrests, however, had declined in recent years.

News article:
Lebanese President Michel Aoun has called upon the country’s top diplomat to file a complaint with the UN Security Council (UNSC) against the Israeli regime’s repeated violations of the Arab country’s sovereignty and airspace to carry out airstrikes in neighboring Syria. Aoun instructed Lebanese Foreign Affairs Minister Abdullah Bou Habib on Monday to take the measure, Arabic-language Lebanon 24 news website said, citing a report by Lebanon's al-Jadeed television station. Syria’s official news agency SANA, citing a military source, reported that Israeli warplanes fired several missiles from the direction of the eastern Lebanese town of Rayaq at some targets near Damascus at about 3:05 a.m. (0005 GMT) local time on Monday, but Syrian air defenses could bring down most of the projectiles. The source noted that the strikes had caused some “material damage.” There were no immediate reports of casualties. Last month, the Lebanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants condemned in the strongest terms an Israeli missile strike against Syria’s strategic western port of Latakia, saying the attack once again exposed the true nature of the Tel Aviv regime. “The [December 28, 2021] attack, which came during the holidays and was the second in less than a month, once again exposes Israel's true face,” the ministry was quoted by Lebanon’s official National News Agency as saying. The ministry then reaffirmed Beirut’s support for “the Syrian Arab Republic and the brotherly Syrian people, who are suffering from the most terrible crisis in their modern history," and wished them "peace and prosperity.” Israel violates Lebanon's airspace and territorial waters on an almost daily basis, claiming the flights and incursions serve surveillance purposes. Lebanon’s government, Hezbollah and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) have repeatedly condemned Israel’s overflights, saying they are in clear violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and the country’s sovereignty. Back on September 30 last year, fighters from Hezbollah intercepted and shot down an Israeli unmanned aerial vehicle while it was hovering over the southern part of Lebanon. Hezbollah said in a brief statement carried by Lebanon’s Arabic-language al-Manar television network that it downed an Israeli drone that had entered the Lebanese skies with “appropriate weapons." The statement added the Israeli aircraft was brought down as it was flying over Maryamin valley on the outskirts of the southern town of Yater.

News article:
Defense Minister Benny Gantz said on Wednesday that Israel has offered the Lebanese army aid multiple times. Gantz, who gave a pre-recorded speech at a conference hosted by the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said that Lebanon has become "an Island of instability" and its citizens "are not our enemies." Gantz said that the Israeli military had offered aid to Lebanon four times in the past year, including last week. Israel, Gantz said, wishes to offer the Lebanese army aid amid a shortage in basic supplies and have lost over 5,000 soldiers recently. The offer, coordinated through the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon, was aimed to help the army "face the strengthening of Hezbollah under Iran's support," Gantz said. A senior Israeli official denied Gantz's claims on Wednesday night. "Israel didn't offer assistance to Lebanon army," the source said, "Israel offered humanitarian aid to the people of Lebanon through the UN following an explosion in one of Lebanon's ports recently." The defense minister also addressed threats posed by Iran. He expressed confidence in the U.S.'s abilities to bring to a "halt the Iranian nuclear project." Gantz also said that the U.S. and Israel are promoting "operational cooperation" in face of a possible nuclear breakthrough by Tehran. Open gallery view Defense Minister Benny Gantz speaking at Haaretz Israel Democracy Conference in September Credit: Hadas Parush A senior diplomat however said that Israel didn't offer to assist the Lebanese army, but offered to provide humanitarian aid to Lebanese people mediated by the United Nations after the port blast in Beirut. Earlier on Wednesday, Gantz began a surprise visit on Wednesday to Bahrain, his spokesperson said. It is the first visit of an Israeli defense minister to Bahrain. Gantz was welcomed at the airport by Bahrain Defense Minister Abdulla bin Hasan Al Nuaimi. On Tuesday Prime Minister Naftali Bennett spoke in the conference and announced that Israel Defense Forces will start using a laser-based missile interception system 'within a year.' The prime minister says that after the laser interception system becomes operational, "The equation will change – they'll invest a lot, and us a little." Each interceptor for the Iron Dome – the missile defense system currently in use – costs about 170,000 shekels (nearly $53,000), and each incoming rocket usually requires more than one interceptor. According to Bennett, the system can also serve "our friends in the region, who are also vulnerable to serious threats from Iran and its proxies."

Hizbullah deputy chief Sheikh Naim Qassem on Monday said that his party is not “worried” over the results of the upcoming parliamentary elections. “We are awaiting the date of the upcoming parliamentary elections so that people decide what they want and we’re not worried of these elections,” Hizbullah number two said in an interview with Iran’s FARS news agency. Moreover, Qassem lashed out at the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon, accusing it of “sponsoring civil society organizations and building them on the basis of stirring chaos and troubles, sabotaging the country’s situation, blocking roads and spoiling the generations with perverse ideas and beliefs.” “This embassy is endorsing the course of the Lebanese Forces, the party that committed massacres against the Lebanese throughout its entire history,” Qassem added.

News article:
President Michel Aoun has stirred controversy by avoiding to consult with Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Najib Miqati regarding a letter that he sent to the U.N. about the sea border demarcation with Israel, media reports said. The letter was delivered by Lebanese Ambassador to U.N. Amal Mudallali at the Presidency’s demand and following a request from Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib, Kuwait’s al-Anbaa newspaper reported. The letter states that Lebanon will now negotiate over Line 29 instead of Line 23 while preserving its right to amend Decree 6433 should there be procrastination, the daily quoted official sources as saying. Speaking to the newspaper, parliamentary sources said Aoun addressed the letter in a “unilateral” manner without consulting with Berri and Miqati, and that Bou Habib has cited Miqati’s “preoccupation with the draft state budget” as an “excuse.” The parliamentary sources added that Aoun’s move might be aimed at appeasing Washington so that it lifts the sanctions imposed on Free Patriotic Movement chief Jebran Bassil. Informed sources meanwhile said that the visit of U.S. energy envoy Amon Hochstein to Lebanon is aimed at “splitting” the offshore oil and gas reserves between Lebanon and Israel instead of demarcating the maritime border.

News article:
Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah on Tuesday claimed Israel was not serious about actually attacking Iran. But if it does, he said, his Lebanese terror group will not automatically retaliate on Tehran’s behalf, but will decide whether or not to get involved. In an interview with Iranian state TV, the leader of the Iran-backed Shiite organization appeared to attempt to assert Hezbollah’s independence from Tehran, while also claiming Israel was afraid to go to war against either. “Iran is a strong regional state and any war with it will blow up the entire region,” he said, according to Naharnet. Amid domestic criticism that his group acts in Tehran’s interests and not Lebanon’s, he challenged anyone to “tell us about a single act that Hezbollah did for the sake of Iran rather than for the sake of Lebanon.” He denied the Iranian embassy in Beirut was involved in Hezbollah’s decision-making. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Nasrallah claimed that the United States fears going to war with Iran, asserting it was incapable of stopping Tehran’s nuclear program. He also warned of “a very intense and harsh” Iranian response if Israel attacks Iran. “Iran is not on joking terms with anyone,” he was quoted as saying by Press TV. He claimed that Hezbollah’s precision-guided missiles were spread all around Lebanon, so Israel would need to launch a full-scale war in order to destroy them. Advertisement He also accused Israel of being afraid to go to war against Hezbollah. “Were the Israeli regime certain that it would be victorious in a war with Hezbollah, it would not hesitate for even a moment,” Nasrallah said. He also claimed that Israeli drone flights over Lebanon have been “greatly reduced” due to Hezbollah’s improved air defenses. Nasrallah added that he opposes sharing offshore gas with Israel and does not really care about negotiations between Beirut and Jerusalem over determining the countries’ exclusive economic zones. “We do not consider ourselves to be concerned with the technical discussions about the sea border demarcation with Israel,” he said. Nasrallah’s remarks come several weeks after both Israel and Lebanon announced their intentions to resume talks over an area of about 860 square kilometers (330 square miles) of the Mediterranean Sea that both countries claim as being within their exclusive economic zones. Advertisement The US envoy mediating the talks has since met with Israeli and Lebanese officials. The two countries started indirect negotiations through a US mediator in 2020 at a UN peacekeeping base in Lebanon’s Naqoura, but the talks have stalled several times.

Lebanon has sunk deep into an economic and financial crisis that started in late 2019 — a culmination of decades of corruption and mismanagement by the political class. The small Mediterranean country is eager to resolve its border dispute with Israel, paving the way for potential lucrative oil and gas deals. Agencies contributed to this report

News article:
Hezbollah's secretary general says the Lebanese resistance movement rejected an offer of financial support by the United States in exchange for turning its back on Palestine and ending confrontation with the occupying Israeli regime. In an interview with Iran’s Arabic-language al-Alam news network on Tuesday, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the Americans tried to negotiate with Hezbollah many times over the past years, both before and after 2000, through various channels. There were discussions between Hezbollah and Washington via intermediaries, but the resistance group announced that there is no need for negotiations as the United States is an enemy, he added. "Previously, they (the Americans) sent us a delegation on behalf of Dick Cheney to negotiate a halt in our support for Palestine and attacks against Israel. In return, they said that they would pay us billions of dollars and even allow us to have our weapons, an offer which we naturally opposed.” Lebanon fought off two Israeli wars in 2000 and 2006. On both occasions, battleground contribution by Hezbollah proved an indispensable asset, forcing the Israeli military into a retreat. Lebanon and the occupying entity are technically at war since the latter has kept the Arab country’s Shebaa Farms under occupation since 1967. Elsewhere in his comments, Nasrallah said, “We do not recognize the existence of Israel. This is the land of Palestine.” He also expressed Hezbollah’s opposition to any attempt by the Lebanese government to normalize ties or cooperate with the Israeli enemy. The main objective of the normalization of ties with Tel Aviv is to make the Palestinian people frustrated so that they would finally relinquish their rights, the Hezbollah chief noted. He further warned the equation that an encroachment on al-Quds means an encroachment on the resistance axis is still in place. Additionally, he asserted that Hezbollah does not interfere in the affairs of the UAE and Saudi Arabia or any other country and that it has no problem with Lebanon's dialogue with Arab states. 'US looting Syria’s resources' Nasrallah said that the United States does not negotiate with terrorists, but always cooperates with them. The US is present in the east of the Euphrates River to plunder Syrian oil and gas, he emphasized. The war on Syria ended without achieving its goals. “Some of the targets being bombed in Syria are affiliated with Hezbollah… But, we have set an equation... If any of us is killed, they must wait for our response… Well, in the attacks now, they are very careful so that no one is killed,” he explained. Iraqi parliament’s decision to expel Americans ‘decisive’ Also in his interview, the Hezbollah secretary general hailed as “decisive” the Iraqi parliament’s decision on the US withdrawal from the Arab country. Baghdad, he said, witnessed large protests demanding the pullout of American troops from Iraq following the martyrdom of Iran’s top anti-terror commander General Qassem Soleimani and his Iraqi ternchmate Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy head of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Units, outside Baghdad International Airport on January 3, 2020. Bahrainis ‘still committed to ideals, principles’ Nasrallah said that what happens in Bahrain is, in fact, a severe repression, the arrest of clerics, the revocation of people’s citizenship and a request for help from foreigners. However, he added, the Bahraini nation still keep adhering to their ideals and principles.

News article:
JNS.org – Iran itself and not its allies will “forcefully retaliate against any Israeli strike” against it, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah told Iranian media in an interview aired on Tuesday. Speaking to the Iranian-based Arabic news channel Al-Alam, in comments translated by the Lebanese news site Naharnet, Nasrallah said that “Iran is a strong regional state, and any war with it will blow up the entire region.” Nasrallah also claimed that Hezbollah’s precision-guided missiles are scattered all over Lebanon, so Israel would need to launch a full-scale war to destroy them, according to i24News, based in Israel. The terror chief boasted that Israeli drone flights over Lebanon have ceased “due to the superiority of Hezbollah’s air defenses,” reported i24News.

News article:
The Israeli army, on Friday, announced that its representatives participated in a tripartite meeting with Lebanese military officials and the commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), Anadolu News Agency reports. In a statement to Anadolu Agency, Israeli army spokesman, Avichay Adraee, said the meeting took place at the UNIFIL headquarters in Ras Al-Naqoura in southern Lebanon. The spokesman said, during the meeting, the Israeli army presented, what it claimed, "Lebanese violations of Security Council Resolution 1701, which focused on the presence of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, and the presence of prohibited weapons there." "Notably, this meeting was pre-determined and forms part of the mechanism to prevent friction along the Blue Line," Adraee added. UNIFIL is a multinational peacekeeping force that has been deployed in southern Lebanon since 1978. Its primary objective is to maintain security in the region and monitor a cessation-of-hostilities agreement. Following the 2006 conflict between Israel and the Lebanese group, Hezbollah, UNIFIL was tasked with ensuring the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which called for a cease-fire between the warring sides and an Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon.

News article:
The Israeli army, on Friday, announced that its representatives participated in a tripartite meeting with Lebanese military officials and the commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), Anadolu News Agency reports. In a statement to Anadolu Agency, Israeli army spokesman, Avichay Adraee, said the meeting took place at the UNIFIL headquarters in Ras Al-Naqoura in southern Lebanon. The spokesman said, during the meeting, the Israeli army presented, what it claimed, "Lebanese violations of Security Council Resolution 1701, which focused on the presence of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, and the presence of prohibited weapons there." "Notably, this meeting was pre-determined and forms part of the mechanism to prevent friction along the Blue Line," Adraee added. UNIFIL is a multinational peacekeeping force that has been deployed in southern Lebanon since 1978. Its primary objective is to maintain security in the region and monitor a cessation-of-hostilities agreement. Following the 2006 conflict between Israel and the Lebanese group, Hezbollah, UNIFIL was tasked with ensuring the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which called for a cease-fire between the warring sides and an Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon.

News article:
The Lebanese army has called on the United Nations to act urgently to end the Israeli regime’s repeated violations of the Arab country’s sovereignty and airspace to carry out airstrikes in neighboring Syria. During a meeting between Head of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) Major General Stefano Del Col and a Lebanese army delegation headed by Brigadier General Haseeb Abdo at the UN headquarters in Ras Naqoura in southern Lebanon on Friday, the Lebanese side asked the world body to pressure Israel to stop its hostile practices, especially the use of Lebanon’s airspace to bomb Syrian lands and its continued violations of Lebanese sovereignty by land, sea and air. The Lebanese army delegation warned of dangerous consequences if Israeli warplanes continue to penetrate into the country’s airspace. It also reaffirmed Beirut’s commitment to international resolutions, especially Security Council Resolution 1701 which ended the 33-day-long Israeli military onslaught on the country in the summer of 2006. The Lebanese army then stressed the need for Israel to withdraw from all occupied Lebanese territories, including the area adjacent to the northern part of the Blue Line, Shebaa Farms as well as Kfarchouba and Ghajar villages. Israel violates Lebanon's airspace and territorial waters on an almost daily basis, claiming the flights and incursions serve surveillance purposes. Lebanon’s government, Hezbollah and the UNIFIL have repeatedly condemned Israel’s overflights, saying they are in clear violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and the country’s sovereignty. Back on September 30 last year, fighters from Hezbollah intercepted and shot down an Israeli unmanned aerial vehicle while it was hovering over the southern part of Lebanon. Hezbollah said in a brief statement carried by Lebanon’s Arabic-language al-Manar television network that it downed an Israeli drone that had entered the Lebanese skies with “appropriate weapons." The statement added the Israeli aircraft was brought down as it was flying over Maryamin valley on the outskirts of the southern town of Yater. ‘Lebanon-Israel talks over disputed maritime border won’t lead to normalization’ Vice President of the Executive Council of the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah Sheikh Ali Damoush stressed that US-mediated talks between Lebanon and Israel regarding a dispute over their Mediterranean Sea border will not result in normalization and establishment of formal ties with the Tel Aviv regime. Addressing worshipers during a sermon of Friday prayers, Sheikh Damoush underscored that the Lebanese representatives must never accept US initiatives that would not conform to Lebanon’s rights. “The US delegation is trying to blackmail Lebanon and exploit its economic crisis in order to wring concessions out of Lebanese officials attending the maritime border talks,” he pointed out. Lebanese politicians hope that commercially viable hydrocarbon resources off Lebanon’s coast could help lift the debt-ridden country out of its worst economic crisis in decades. In February 2018, Lebanon signed its first contract for drilling in two blocks in the Mediterranean with a consortium comprising energy giants Total, Eni and Novatek. Lebanon and Israel took part in indirect talks to discuss demarcation in 2020. But they stalled after Lebanon demanded a larger area, including part of the Karish gas field, where Israel has given exploration rights to a Greek firm. The talks were supposed to discuss a Lebanese demand for 860sq km (330 square miles) of territory in the disputed maritime area, according to a map sent to the United Nations in 2011. However, Lebanon then said the map was based on erroneous calculations and demanded 1,430sq km (552 square miles) more further south, including part of Karish.

News article:
Secretary General of Lebanon’s Hezbollah resistance movement Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah says the resistance group is making rockets and drones on its own and has the capability to turn rockets into precision missiles. Nasrallah said in a televised speech on Wednesday that Hezbollah has developed the capability to make rockets and drones on its own. “We have started manufacturing drones,” he said, addressing the Israeli regime’s rulers. "We have been producing drones in Lebanon for a long time and whoever wants to buy them, submit an order," he added. Pointing to Israeli threats, the Hezbollah chief said the enemies only threaten others with war but they know it will be very difficult and costly for them. He said Hezbollah is capable of upgrading the quality of its rockets to fend off Israeli threats. “We have the ability to convert our rockets into precision missiles and we started that years ago,” he said, adding that Hezbollah possesses thousands of rockets that the enemies are unable to locate. “I tell the Israelis that their ‘war between the wars’ has turned the threat into an opportunity for the resistance,” he said. Nasrallah pointed out that in a few months Hezbollah will be 40 years old, saying the blood of the martyrs has baptized and strengthened the path of resistance. He made the remarks in a ceremony on the martyrdom anniversary of resistance leaders Sheikh Ragheb Harb, Sayyed Abbas al-Mousawi and Imad Mughniyeh. Sheikh Ragheb Harb was assassinated by an Israeli agent on February 16, 1984; late Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Abbas al-Mousawi was martyred in an Israeli airstrike targeting his convoy on February 16, 1992; and the resistance movement’s top military commander Imad Moghniyeh was martyred in a car bomb attack carried out by Israeli Mossad agents on February 12, 2008. Nasrallah said the motto of this year’s ceremony is “Decision 1982.” He said Lebanon faced a threat of occupation by Israel in 1982, noting that resistance has been the force that protected the identity of Lebanon in face of Israeli threats. “In 1982, Lebanon was facing a huge threat and on the brink of falling victim to Israeli hegemony. Resistance factions, including Hezbollah, were the ones who protected Lebanon's identity. The resistance defended this identity with blood,” he stated. According to the Hezbollah leader, the ideology of resistance in the region began long before the founding of Hezbollah. Resistance leaders have refused to surrender to the Israeli regime or accept its occupation, Nasrallah said. He then denounced the Muslim countries that normalized their relations with Israel, describing the latter as a “temporary regime” which is moving towards its collapse. “Some in Lebanon and the region imagine that the future is linked to Israel and that's why they are resorting to normalization with it,” he said. Nasrallah also said the resistance movement has been gaining victories against the Israeli regime since 1985, adding, “We are facing Israel as an entity that has been weakened and is going downward.” The resistance is confronting the enemy’s ambitions, protecting Lebanon and supporting Palestine, he said. Pledging to follow in the footsteps of the martyrs of resistance, the Hezbollah chief said resistance will keep its vow despite all conspiracies and lobbying. He pointed out that Israel is the only regime today that has been described as “apartheid,” saying the regime’s officials have confessed that they face a struggle to lengthen the entity’s life. “The resistance factions in the region, including Hezbollah, believe that the Zionist entity is a fugitive entity that’s falling back,” he said. He said there is a lack of confidence in the Israeli army and among its generals. Nasrallah, however, clarified that he was not underestimating Israel’s power. Yet he reiterated that Israel “is in decline.” “We encourage the Israelis to leave Palestine and we’re ready to pay for their travel tickets,” he asserted. He promised the Israeli forces a second Ansariyeh operation if they try to conduct an attack against Hezbollah’s precision missiles project in Lebanon. He further elaborated on the resistance movement’s role in Lebanon, saying it only exists to defend and protect Lebanon. “We insist on strengthening and equipping the army and we also insist that the assistance should not come from a single side,” he stated. Elsewhere in his remarks, Nasrallah said Iran has always openly supported resistance in Lebanon. He also underlined the importance of holding Lebanon’s elections on time, saying Hezbollah will definitely participate in the polls. “Those who are accusing us of delaying the Lebanese parliamentary elections seem to be the ones who really want this delay,” he added.

News article:
Hezbollah terror chief Hassan Nasrallah told his followers on Wednesday that his group has the ability to reengineer thousands of rockets as precision-guided weapons. Marking 30 years since the assassination of Nasrallah’s predecessor, Abbas al-Musawi, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon in 1992, Nasrallah said “the Zionist entity is in the midst of a crisis and nearing its end.” “We now possess the ability to transform our thousands of rockets into precision-guided missiles,” Nasrallah told his followers in comments carried by the Lebanese news site Naharnet. “We’ve been doing it for years.” He claimed Hezbollah carried out the project with “experts from the Islamic Republic of Iran,” according to Reuters. Rockets are projectiles with propulsion systems, but no guidance system directs them toward a target after they are launched.

Hezbollah terror chief Hassan Nasrallah told his followers on Wednesday that his group has the ability to reengineer thousands of rockets as precision-guided weapons. Marking 30 years since the assassination of Nasrallah’s predecessor, Abbas al-Musawi, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon in 1992, Nasrallah said “the Zionist entity is in the midst of a crisis and nearing its end.” “We now possess the ability to transform our thousands of rockets into precision-guided missiles,” Nasrallah told his followers in comments carried by the Lebanese news site Naharnet. “We’ve been doing it for years.” He claimed Hezbollah carried out the project with “experts from the Islamic Republic of Iran,” according to Reuters.

News article:
Lebanon’s Foreign Minister responded positively to proposals from US negotiator Amos Hochstein on settling a maritime border dispute with Israel, in comments published Friday, as Hezbollah terror chief Hassan Nasrallah reportedly gave a green light to continue negotiations. Longtime foes Israel and Lebanon have been engaged in US-led talks over the past year aimed at demarcating offshore exclusive economic zones. The disputed area, hundreds of square miles wide, is thought to contain large deposits of natural gas, a potential game changer for Lebanon, which is mired in a devastating economic crisis. Foreign Minister Abdallah Bouhabib told the Lebanese Al Joumhouria newspaper that US mediator Amos Hochstein brought “positive proposals that can be built upon” and that Lebanon’s President Michel Aoun had asked for them to be delivered in writing so the country can formally respond. Hochstein, the US State Department’s Senior Adviser for Global Energy Security, notified Israel recently that Nasrallah had given his approval to the Lebanese government to move forward with the negotiations, according to a Thursday Haaretz daily report. Defense officials told the newspaper the terror group is keen on an agreement. In October, Nasrallah had warned Israel against unilaterally searching for natural gas in the disputed maritime region before any agreement is reached.

Israel and Lebanon had resumed negotiations over their disputed maritime border in 2020 but the process was stalled by Beirut’s claim that the map used by the United Nations in the talks needed modifying.

A senior defense official told Haaretz that solving the dispute is of high priority for the United States, due to its belief it can help alleviate Lebanon’s spiraling energy crisis. Lebanon is currently grappling with its worst-ever financial crisis, and fuel shortages have ground the country to a halt in recent months. With a bankrupt state unable to deliver more than an hour or two of electricity a day, individuals, businesses and institutions have relied almost entirely on diesel-powered generators. Both Israel and Lebanon announced last month their intentions to resume talks. Hochstein met with Israel’s Energy Minister Karine Elharrar last month.

News article:
Hizbullah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah gave his approval to the Lebanese government to proceed with the demarcation negotiations, Israeli newspaper Haaretz said. According to the Israeli daily, international representatives have met with Lebanese counterparts close to Hizbullah in the recent weeks to reach an agreement. The Israeli newspaper reported that Hizbullah was "the main obstacle" and was refusing any deal because it considered it "an attempt at normalization with Israel or recognition of its ownership of the area." Yet, Israeli security sources told Haaretz that "Hizbullah is interested in concluding the talks with an agreement." The sources believe "the road is paved to an agreement" that will end the conflict over the marine boundary between the two countries. "The agreement is expected to appoint an international mediating actor acceptable to all sides, who will determine the royalties due to each side, and will be in charge of overseeing the transfer of funds and gas due to each country from the extracting companies," the daily said. On another note, Hizbullah refused to accept an agreement "precluding them from acting against Israel in the future," Haaretz added. U.S. Special Envoy and Coordinator for International Energy Affairs Amos Hochstein had arrived in Lebanon this month to revive talks between Lebanon and Israel over a maritime border dispute that is holding up oil and gas explorations. Lebanese politicians hope that commercially viable hydrocarbon resources off Lebanon's coast could help lift the debt-ridden country out of its financial crisis branded by the World Bank as one of the planet's worst in modern times, while Israelis are pushing for speeding up the negotiations to start drilling for gas in the disputed Karish field.

News article:
In a televised Feb. 16 address, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah lauded the Lebanese terrorist group’s increasing military capabilities, with an emphasis on its missile and drone arsenals. Nasrallah boasted that Hezbollah had managed to convert many of its missiles into precision-guided armaments, despite Israel’s best efforts to prevent this. Due to the “threat of transporting precision missiles from Iran to Lebanon and in cooperation with our specialized technicians and experts and those of the Islamic Republic [Iran], we have developed the capability of converting our missiles, which number in the thousands, to precision-guided missiles. We started this process years ago, not now,” he said. The Hezbollah leader threatened that should Israel attempt to search for these missiles, it would face a second “Operation Ansariya,” alluding to the terror group’s deadly ambush in 1997 of an Israeli naval commando force near the village of Ansariya in southern Lebanon. Nasrallah also lauded Hezbollah’s drone production, saying, “We have been producing drones in Lebanon for a long time, and whoever wants to buy them, submit an order.” He also claimed that Hezbollah’s increased air-defense capabilities had led to a decrease in Israeli air operations over Lebanon. According to Hezbollah, reduced Israeli surveillance flights have forced Israel to recruit more agents in Lebanon to compensate. To demonstrate its capabilities, Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force recently launched a drone into northern Israel, which was shot down and landed intact in Israeli territory. In response, on Feb. 20, Hezbollah launched another drone, which Hezbollah claimed had penetrated some 43 miles into Israeli territory, hovering for 40 minutes and then safely returning to Lebanon. The drone was named “Hassan” after the founder of Hezbollah’s drone force, Hassan al-Laqqis. Hezbollah presented the incident as a “new slap in the face” to Israel, quoting Israeli officials who highlighted the “failure of the Israeli military and technological system to commandeer and shoot down the drone.” Hezbollah stressed that to cover for its “military failure,” Israeli jet fighters made a low-level flight over the skies of Beirut and the Hezbollah neighborhood of Dahiye. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories In accelerating the use of aircraft of all kinds, Nasrallah’s message is clear: Israel does not control the skies, and Hezbollah can violate Israeli sovereignty and sow fear and anxiety across Israel’s north. As Hezbollah’s aircraft improve, with close Iranian assistance, its air threat to Israel will increase. Nasrallah also claimed that last summer Hezbollah carried out its largest exercise since its establishment in 1982. The terror group also showed off on its Al Manar television its “alpinist unit,” conducting exercises on snowmobiles at an altitude of 4,500 feet. Nasrallah’s show of force comes against a backdrop of growing internal difficulties in Hezbollah due to the ongoing economic crisis in Lebanon. Hezbollah’s opponents accuse the organization of being Iran’s messenger boy and Nasrallah of personally representing the interests in Lebanon of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Nasrallah was recently forced to reiterate that “Hezbollah is Lebanese, from its top leadership to all its fighters, people and environment. Hezbollah’s decisions are Lebanese. It takes into consideration the interests of Lebanon and its people. It is a friend and ally to Iran, but this does not oblige it with any commitment. Hezbollah makes its (own) decisions… and Iran doesn’t impose its dictates. … Tell us of a single act that Hezbollah did for the sake of Iran rather than for the sake of Lebanon.” These protestations are greeted with contempt in Lebanon and beyond. Hezbollah’s willingness to be Iran’s cannon fodder in Syria and sacrifice over 2,000 fighters and thousands of wounded not for jihad against Israel but for Iranian strategic purposes betrays the reality: Nasrallah serves as Khamenei’s representative in Lebanon, for all intents and purposes. In a further attempt at pretense, Nasrallah claimed that should Israel attack Iran’s nuclear facilities, Hezbollah “will convene and decide how to respond and according to the circumstances.” Or in other words, that Hezbollah’s reaction will not be automatic and will reflect Lebanon’s national interests. The Hezbollah leader throws sand in observers’ eyes and plays with words. Two months ago, Nasrallah secretly visited Tehran, meeting with Khamenei and senior commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Quds Force to discuss options and responses in case Israel attacked Iran’s nuclear facilities, as well as coordination between Iran and Hezbollah in this scenario. Iran’s directives to Hezbollah in the event of such an attack are clear and brook no interpretation: launch long-range missiles at Tel Aviv and strategic targets deep inside Israel. Nasrallah, meanwhile, defiantly called on Jews to leave Israel and return to their home countries, adding mockingly that “we are ready to bear the cost of their tickets.” Hezbollah is in the thick of preparations for parliamentary elections in Lebanon this May. Hezbollah stresses that it seeks to hold the elections on time and rejects the possibility of delaying them. Hezbollah is concerned about the possibility of a decline in the electoral power of the National Patriotic Party, its ally in the Christian camp. The terror group appears to be working to strengthen its ties with the Christian camp and with its Shi’ite allies, led by Amal’s leader, Nabih Berry. At the same time, Hezbollah is stepping up its attacks on the United States and particularly on the involvement of the U.S. ambassador in Beirut in internal Lebanese politics. The U.S. embassy is accused of aiding and encouraging NGOs that work against Hezbollah, of involvement in Lebanon’s economy and of being the cause of Lebanon’s financial crisis. American military assistance, and in particular the American financial assistance to pay the salaries of Lebanese army soldiers and officers, do not lower the intensity of Hezbollah’s criticism.

News article:
In a televised Feb. 16 address, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah lauded the Lebanese terrorist group’s increasing military capabilities, with an emphasis on its missile and drone arsenals. Nasrallah boasted that Hezbollah had managed to convert many of its missiles into precision-guided armaments, despite Israel’s best efforts to prevent this. Due to the “threat of transporting precision missiles from Iran to Lebanon and in cooperation with our specialized technicians and experts and those of the Islamic Republic [Iran], we have developed the capability of converting our missiles, which number in the thousands, to precision-guided missiles. We started this process years ago, not now,” he said. The Hezbollah leader threatened that should Israel attempt to search for these missiles, it would face a second “Operation Ansariya,” alluding to the terror group’s deadly ambush in 1997 of an Israeli naval commando force near the village of Ansariya in southern Lebanon. Nasrallah also lauded Hezbollah’s drone production, saying, “We have been producing drones in Lebanon for a long time, and whoever wants to buy them, submit an order.” He also claimed that Hezbollah’s increased air-defense capabilities had led to a decrease in Israeli air operations over Lebanon. According to Hezbollah, reduced Israeli surveillance flights have forced Israel to recruit more agents in Lebanon to compensate. To demonstrate its capabilities, Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force recently launched a drone into northern Israel, which was shot down and landed intact in Israeli territory. In response, on Feb. 20, Hezbollah launched another drone, which Hezbollah claimed had penetrated some 43 miles into Israeli territory, hovering for 40 minutes and then safely returning to Lebanon. The drone was named “Hassan” after the founder of Hezbollah’s drone force, Hassan al-Laqqis. Hezbollah presented the incident as a “new slap in the face” to Israel, quoting Israeli officials who highlighted the “failure of the Israeli military and technological system to commandeer and shoot down the drone.” Hezbollah stressed that to cover for its “military failure,” Israeli jet fighters made a low-level flight over the skies of Beirut and the Hezbollah neighborhood of Dahiye. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories In accelerating the use of aircraft of all kinds, Nasrallah’s message is clear: Israel does not control the skies, and Hezbollah can violate Israeli sovereignty and sow fear and anxiety across Israel’s north. As Hezbollah’s aircraft improve, with close Iranian assistance, its air threat to Israel will increase. Nasrallah also claimed that last summer Hezbollah carried out its largest exercise since its establishment in 1982. The terror group also showed off on its Al Manar television its “alpinist unit,” conducting exercises on snowmobiles at an altitude of 4,500 feet. Nasrallah’s show of force comes against a backdrop of growing internal difficulties in Hezbollah due to the ongoing economic crisis in Lebanon. Hezbollah’s opponents accuse the organization of being Iran’s messenger boy and Nasrallah of personally representing the interests in Lebanon of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Nasrallah was recently forced to reiterate that “Hezbollah is Lebanese, from its top leadership to all its fighters, people and environment. Hezbollah’s decisions are Lebanese. It takes into consideration the interests of Lebanon and its people. It is a friend and ally to Iran, but this does not oblige it with any commitment. Hezbollah makes its (own) decisions… and Iran doesn’t impose its dictates. … Tell us of a single act that Hezbollah did for the sake of Iran rather than for the sake of Lebanon.” These protestations are greeted with contempt in Lebanon and beyond. Hezbollah’s willingness to be Iran’s cannon fodder in Syria and sacrifice over 2,000 fighters and thousands of wounded not for jihad against Israel but for Iranian strategic purposes betrays the reality: Nasrallah serves as Khamenei’s representative in Lebanon, for all intents and purposes. In a further attempt at pretense, Nasrallah claimed that should Israel attack Iran’s nuclear facilities, Hezbollah “will convene and decide how to respond and according to the circumstances.” Or in other words, that Hezbollah’s reaction will not be automatic and will reflect Lebanon’s national interests. The Hezbollah leader throws sand in observers’ eyes and plays with words. Two months ago, Nasrallah secretly visited Tehran, meeting with Khamenei and senior commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Quds Force to discuss options and responses in case Israel attacked Iran’s nuclear facilities, as well as coordination between Iran and Hezbollah in this scenario. Iran’s directives to Hezbollah in the event of such an attack are clear and brook no interpretation: launch long-range missiles at Tel Aviv and strategic targets deep inside Israel. Nasrallah, meanwhile, defiantly called on Jews to leave Israel and return to their home countries, adding mockingly that “we are ready to bear the cost of their tickets.” Hezbollah is in the thick of preparations for parliamentary elections in Lebanon this May. Hezbollah stresses that it seeks to hold the elections on time and rejects the possibility of delaying them. Hezbollah is concerned about the possibility of a decline in the electoral power of the National Patriotic Party, its ally in the Christian camp. The terror group appears to be working to strengthen its ties with the Christian camp and with its Shi’ite allies, led by Amal’s leader, Nabih Berry. At the same time, Hezbollah is stepping up its attacks on the United States and particularly on the involvement of the U.S. ambassador in Beirut in internal Lebanese politics. The U.S. embassy is accused of aiding and encouraging NGOs that work against Hezbollah, of involvement in Lebanon’s economy and of being the cause of Lebanon’s financial crisis. American military assistance, and in particular the American financial assistance to pay the salaries of Lebanese army soldiers and officers, do not lower the intensity of Hezbollah’s criticism. Ironically, the aid is welcome and most appreciated since it strengthens the Lebanese army, an ally of Hezbollah. IDF Brig. Gen. (ret.)

News article:
Lebanese President Michel Aoun has denounced repeated Israeli violations of the Arab country’s sovereignty, calling on the United Nations to compel the Tel Aviv regime to implement Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 33-day Israeli military onslaught in 2006, and respect Lebanon's territorial integrity. During a meeting with the outgoing commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), Major General Stefano Del Col, on Thursday, Aoun stressed that the Beirut government “is committed to maintaining calm and stability in southern Lebanon and implementing Resolution 1701.” He highlighted that Israeli violations of Lebanon’s sovereignty are condemned by all strata of the Lebanese society, stating that the UN should exert pressure on Israel to stop such violations. Aoun also underscored Lebanon’s full rights and sovereignty by land, sea and air, in accordance with the international law and treaties. For his part, Del Col praised the strong relations between UNIFIL forces and local authorities in southern Lebanon. He expressed hope that the UN Security Council would extend UNIFIL’s mandate for a period exceeding 6 months, which is stipulated in the previous relevant resolution. “I wish Lebanon a future without international security forces, where the Lebanese nation would live in peace,” Del Col said. Israel violates Lebanon's airspace and territorial waters on an almost daily basis, claiming the flights and incursions serve surveillance purposes. Lebanon’s government, Hezbollah and UNIFIL have repeatedly condemned Israel’s overflights, saying they are in clear violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and the country’s sovereignty. Back on September 30 last year, fighters from Hezbollah intercepted and shot down an Israeli unmanned aerial vehicle while it was hovering over the southern part of Lebanon. Hezbollah said in a brief statement carried by Lebanon’s Arabic-language al-Manar television network that it downed an Israeli drone that had entered the Lebanese skies with “appropriate weapons." The statement added that the Israeli aircraft was brought down as it was flying over Maryamin valley on the outskirts of the southern town of Yater.

News article:
Hizbullah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has said that Hizbullah "has never been as strong as it is today." Nasrallah stated, in an interview with al-Manar TV, that "if Israel starts a war on Lebanon, then it will see all our strength.” The Israeli military had failed last week to intercept a drone that crossed its northern border. Hizbullah claimed responsibility and minutes later, two Israeli warplanes overflew Beirut and its suburbs at a very low altitude in a mock raid. "Israel is a temporary entity," Nasrallah said. "It will cease to exist," he added. Nasrallah stressed that "if you remain silent and surrender your weapons, you tell your opponent that you are crushed, humiliated and weak." "The enemy will not pity you, it will humiliate you even more," Nasrallah added. "Let them give us one example of peoples who resisted, surrendered their weapons, and kept their dignity," Nasrallah said. Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib had headed to Kuwait last month to deliver Lebanon's answers to a paper of demands that had been delivered to Lebanon by the Kuwaiti Foreign Minister. Sheikh Ahmed al-Nasser said it was "a Kuwaiti, Gulf, Arab and international message" containing measures and ideas to build confidence again with Lebanon. The measures included Lebanon's commitment to U.N. resolutions related to Hizbullah's disarmament. Bou Habib made it clear, ahead of his departure to Kuwait, that Lebanon will not disarm Hizbullah.

News article:
A high-ranking Hezbollah official says fighters with the Lebanese resistance movement are fully prepared to fight enemy forces on multiple fronts at the same time, and inflict defeats on them. Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, head of the Executive Council of Hezbollah, said in a ceremony on Thursday that his group has long prepared itself to protect Lebanon in the face of a possible military confrontation. He stressed that the resistance movement vigorously pursues the interests of the entire Lebanese nation in order to foster national unity. Earlier this month, Hezbollah officials said that the Lebanese resistance group’s capabilities have shocked and humiliated the Israeli regime, stressing that the unmanned aerial vehicle that flew over Israeli-occupied territories is merely a small fraction of those capabilities. The president of the Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc, which is the political wing of Hezbollah in the Lebanese parliament, said the resistance movement’s deterrent power has struck horror in the heart of the Israeli regime. Mohammad Raad hailed the Hassan drone as one of Hezbollah’s outstanding military achievements which will prevent Israel from staging attacks against Lebanon, saying the drone was merely a small part of weapons produced by the resistance group to protect Lebanon against Israel. He underlined that Hezbollah defends the entire Lebanon and is standing by the side of the Lebanese people amid a financial and economic crisis in the Arab country. On February 19, Safieddine said Hezbollah is sure to emerge victorious from any war, citing the group’s achievements, including its recent successful flying of a drone over the Israeli-occupied territories. Hezbollah is strong and is capable of winning any type of warfare, the senior Hezbollah official said. The future belongs to the resistance as well as the equation that was established by Martyr Hassan al-Qais and the Hassan drone, the unmanned aerial vehicle, which was named after him, Safieddine noted. Hezbollah calls on Lebanese forces to increase vigilance in face of Israeli plots Meanwhile, Hezbollah praised Lebanon's Internal Security Forces (ISF) for thwarting three terrorist attacks plotted by the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group. The resistance movement said in a statement that the operation was yet another achievement in light of efforts to break up Israeli cells involved in espionage activities against Hezbollah as well as its sensitive sites and military capabilities. Hezbollah then urged Lebanese security forces to increase vigilance, and maintain preparedness to prevent the Israeli enemy from exploiting any gap amid the socioeconomic crisis plaguing the nation. Lebanon's Interior Ministry said on Wednesday that security forces had thwarted a plan by the Daesh terrorists to carry out three bombings targeting Hezbollah religious compounds in Beirut's southern suburbs. “A terrorist group had recruited young men in Lebanon to carry out major bombing attacks using explosive belts" and other munitions, Interior Minister Bassam Mawlawi told a press conference. "Three separate targets were to be hit at the same time," the ministry said, in an operation Mawlawi said would have caused significant loss of life.

News article:
Hezbollah supporters wave their group and Iranian flags during a protest on the Lebanese-Israeli border near the southern village of Kafr Kila, Lebanon, May 14, 2021. (AP) Beirut - Asharq Al-Awsat Supporters of the Hezbollah party in Lebanon have increased their threats against opponents through social media ahead of the May parliamentary elections. The latest threat was against Lebanese University professor Bassel Saleh. Threats are often made ahead of elections, but this year they take on a new edge given that the polls are taking place after the 2019 popular revolt against Lebanon's ruling class. Civil society groups that have emerged from the protests are working hard to run in the elections, with hopes pinned that they would achieve a breakthrough given the support they have from the people. Saleh, a native of Kfar Shouba in the South - a Hezbollah stronghold, revealed that he received a death threat through social media from a party loyalist after he had criticized the party in wake of Israeli jets flying over Lebanon in recent days. He said Hezbollah supporters were "arrogant" for boasting that they did not fear the jets. Saleh wrote on social media: "Aren't [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah and his party ruling us so that Israeli jets could stop violating our airspace?" He added that he didn't understand the "arrogance that comes with those who boast of excessive force and not fearing death". He also cited the detention of a "militiaman in Chouya" for launching a rocket towards Israel last summer. The man, a Hezbollah member, was riding a rocket launcher in the southern region of Chouya. He was held by a number of local residents after he launched the projectile. Soon after making his posts, Saleh revealed that he received a direct threat against his life, with the aggressor even knowing where he worked. He said the Hezbollah supporter was defying the law and security agencies, while his followers cheered him on. "These are a group of people, who claim patriotism and purity, according to their standards alone, while accusing those who oppose them of treason and that they should be taken out," said Saleh. He urged the security agencies and international powers monitoring Lebanon to make note of the threat. "We are waging a direct conflict with an alliance of militias and mafias. We are at the mercy of theft, deception and the violation of all rights," he continued. He told Asharq Al-Awsat that he was following up on the legal proceedings after he had filed a complaint over the threat. Saleh tied the threat to the upcoming elections and his activism along with others in the South. He said the supporters were primarily "irked by his criticism of the alleged invincible fighter, whose image the party has been building for the past 35 years, and whom he described as a militiaman." Moreover, he remarked that Hezbollah will be wary of the electoral battle in the South. He said the party was able to terrorize the southerners who took to the street in 2019 and it will make sure that the dissidents' voices are not heard at the ballot boxes. Saleh predicted that the party will intensify its campaign against its opponents as the elections draw near. He cited the assassination of Shiite dissident Lokman Slim in 2021 as evidence of how far the party will go to silence opponents. He also recalled the intimidation against Shiite activists ahead of the 2018 elections. Journalist Ali al-Amine, who was running for a seat in the South, was even assaulted. Researcher and professor Mona Fayyad said Hezbollah's threats against opponents will only intensify ahead of the elections, not ruling out the possibility of it resorting to assassinations. She told Asharq Al-Awsat that the party is being defensive, adding that the it will use the elections to reap more seats in parliament and prove that its popularity has not waned in spite of the evident rising voices of dissent among its Shiite community. The party's real image had been exposed, she continued, especially after Israeli gas will be pumped to Lebanon and after the authorities signaled that they were prepared to relinquish some territory for Israel in the maritime border negotiations. The people view this all as an act of treason, so the party will react in self-defense, she warned.

Saleh wrote on social media: "Aren't [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah and his party ruling us so that Israeli jets could stop violating our airspace?" He added that he didn't understand the "arrogance that comes with those who boast of excessive force and not fearing death". He also cited the detention of a "militiaman in Chouya" for launching a rocket towards Israel last summer. The man, a Hezbollah member, was riding a rocket launcher in the southern region of Chouya. He was held by a number of local residents after he launched the projectile. Soon after making his posts, Saleh revealed that he received a direct threat against his life, with the aggressor even knowing where he worked. He said the Hezbollah supporter was defying the law and security agencies, while his followers cheered him on. "These are a group of people, who claim patriotism and purity, according to their standards alone, while accusing those who oppose them of treason and that they should be taken out," said Saleh. He urged the security agencies and international powers monitoring Lebanon to make note of the threat. "We are waging a direct conflict with an alliance of militias and mafias. We are at the mercy of theft, deception and the violation of all rights," he continued. He told Asharq Al-Awsat that he was following up on the legal proceedings after he had filed a complaint over the threat. Saleh tied the threat to the upcoming elections and his activism along with others in the South. He said the supporters were primarily "irked by his criticism of the alleged invincible fighter, whose image the party has been building for the past 35 years, and whom he described as a militiaman." Moreover, he remarked that Hezbollah will be wary of the electoral battle in the South. He said the party was able to terrorize the southerners who took to the street in 2019 and it will make sure that the dissidents' voices are not heard at the ballot boxes. Saleh predicted that the party will intensify its campaign against its opponents as the elections draw near. He cited the assassination of Shiite dissident Lokman Slim in 2021 as evidence of how far the party will go to silence opponents. He also recalled the intimidation against Shiite activists ahead of the 2018 elections. Journalist Ali al-Amine, who was running for a seat in the South, was even assaulted. Researcher and professor Mona Fayyad said Hezbollah's threats against opponents will only intensify ahead of the elections, not ruling out the possibility of it resorting to assassinations. She told Asharq Al-Awsat that the party is being defensive, adding that the it will use the elections to reap more seats in parliament and prove that its popularity has not waned in spite of the evident rising voices of dissent among its Shiite community. The party's real image had been exposed, she continued, especially after Israeli gas will be pumped to Lebanon and after the authorities signaled that they were prepared to relinquish some territory for Israel in the maritime border negotiations. The people view this all as an act of treason, so the party will react in self-defense, she warned.

Iran said Monday that differences with the United States remain over the issues of lifting sanctions and obtaining guarantees in Vienna talks aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear deal. "Important and significant issues remain regarding the removal of sanctions that have not made an agreement possible so far," foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said at a news conference. He reiterated calls for guarantees that the US will not withdraw from the 2015 deal, which was derailed in 2018 when the administration of then-president Donald Trump unilaterally pulled out of the pact. Khatibzadeh's remarks came as the eighth round of negations to restore the agreement -- known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) -- has been on pause since Friday, with the negotiators returning to their capitals for consultations. The European Union's coordinator for the talks, Enrique Mora, said at the time that "political decisions" are required to break the deadlock, and that talks are expected to resume this week. The drive to salvage the nuclear deal resumed in late November, after talks were suspended in June as Iran elected ultraconservative President Ebrahim Raisi. The deal -- agreed by Iran, the US, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- offered Tehran sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme. But the US reimposed severe economic sanctions after the 2018 withdrawal, prompting Tehran to begin rolling back on its commitments under the deal. Khatibzadeh nonetheless noted "very significant progress" over the previous three weeks in negotiations over the lifting of sanctions and nuclear commitments, as well as obtaining guarantees. "We suggest that after returning from their capitals, (other parties) come with necessary decisions so that we can conclude quickly what has been prepared in drafts," he said. "The other parties know the differences clearly. They need to make political decisions, especially in Washington," he added. "We await political decisions by Washington upon the return of the US delegation." The US has participated only indirectly in the talks, which seek to bring Washington back to the accord and to ensure Iran returns to its commitments under the deal. "We can reach a lasting, reliable and good agreement the day after the return of the negotiators to Vienna" if the other parties make the "right" political decisions, he added.

News article:
TEHRAN, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian on Thursday called for a "stable and reliable" nuclear agreement in the ongoing Vienna talks, which aimed at resolving disputes between the Islamic republic and the western countries over the revival of the 2015 nuclear deal. "Iran is ready to reach a good, stable and reliable agreement" in the talks underway in Vienna, Amir Abdollahian made the remarks in a telephone conversation with his Japanese counterpart Yoshimasa Hayashi, according to Iranian Foreign Ministry's website. The Japanese top diplomat expressed his country's support for the Vienna talks, stressing the need for serious action by all parties to live up to their commitments and seize the current opportunity to reach an agreement. Amir Abdollahian thanked Japan for its support and readiness to help advance the Vienna talks. The Vienna talks, which began last year to restore the nuclear pact following the withdrawal of the United States in 2018, have now reached a crucial stage for political decisions of the parties involved, according to analysts. ■

News article:
The Biden administration reportedly believes that a revival of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran would no longer achieve the key condition of keeping Tehran one year away from amassing enough nuclear fuel for a bomb. US officials told The Wall Street Journal Thursday that Iran’s so-called breakout time would be significantly less than a year due to the advancements it has made in its nuclear program since former US president Donald Trump withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2018. The exact length of the breakout time will depend on the manner in which Iran agrees to return to compliance with the deal, be it by dismantling its stockpiles of enriched uranium and relevant pieces of equipment, destroying them or shipping them abroad. However, enough nuclear material for a bomb is not the same as having the capabilities to build the core of the weapon and to attach it to the warhead of a missile, which Iran is not believed to possess and would likely take many more months to achieve. Despite the JCPOA’s more limited impact, US negotiators are still committed to returning to the deal, guided by the belief that some restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program are better than none at all.

However, some administration officials warn that if the breakout time is less than six months, it will be much more difficult for the US to respond to a rapid acceleration of Iran’s nuclear program, The Wall Street Journal reported. A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics of the US breakout assessments reported by the Journal, but said that a revived agreement “would address our urgent nonproliferation concerns.” “As we have said, we have only a few weeks to conclude an understanding, after which the pace of Iran’s nuclear advances will make return to the JCPOA impossible,” the spokesperson said.

News article:
Iran's top security official said Sunday that Washington and Tehran had so far failed to produce "balance" in their commitments during the Vienna talks aimed at restoring the nuclear deal. "Despite limited progress in the #ViennaTalks, we are still far from achieving the necessary balance in the commitments of the parties," Supreme National Security Council secretary Ali Shamkhani said in a Twitter post. "Political decisions in #Washington are requirements for balance of commitments to reach a good agreement." Iran is engaged in negotiations with Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia directly and with the United States indirectly to revive the 2015 deal formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. After months of stalemate, progress has been made in recent weeks to revive the agreement that was supposed to prevent Iran from acquiring an atomic bomb, a goal it has always denied pursuing. Former U.S. president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the pact in 2018 and reimposed tough economic sanctions on Iran, prompting the Islamic republic to begin pulling back from its commitments under the deal. Talks on reviving the agreement were halted last week and the negotiators returned to their capitals for consultations. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, in a phone call with Iran's foreign minister on Saturday, said he expected all parties to come to Vienna with a clear agenda to reach an agreement and be ready to make political decisions. Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said in the call that "positive developments have taken place since the previous talks, but they still do not meet our expectations. "We are determinedly seeking a good deal, but at the same time we are focusing on preserving our red lines and national interests." The U.S. State Department on Friday said it was waiving sanctions on Iran's civil nuclear program in a technical step necessary to return to the JCPOA. The waiver allows other countries and companies to participate in Iran's civil nuclear program without triggering U.S. sanctions on them, in the name of promoting safety and non-proliferation. "What happens on paper is good but not enough," Amir-Abdollahian said on Saturday, adding that "we seek and demand guarantees in the political, legal and economic sectors."

News article:
The eighth round of talks between senior representatives of Iran and the P4+1 group of countries on the revival of the 2015 deal has resumed in the Austrian capital of Vienna after a 10-day break. Envoys from Iran and the five remaining signatories to the deal -- Britain, France, Russia, and China plus Germany--have been holding negotiations in the Austrian capital for 10 months with the aim of reviving the agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), through bringing the US back to the deal. The two sides have bridged some gaps since the talks began last year but differences remain, especially on the issue of US sanctions. Tehran wants all sanctions imposed by the administration of former US president Donald Trump removed and says the issue is its red line. The eighth round of the negotiations were briefly put on hold as diplomats returned to their capitals for consultations. On Tuesday, Iran's lead negotiator to the Vienna talks Ali Bagheri Kani met with Enrique Mora, the European Union’s deputy foreign policy chief and head of the JCPOA Joint Commission, as well as head of the Russian delegation Mikhail Ulyanov. After a short break, 8th round of #ViennaTalks is resumed. pic.twitter.com/RsjDr5siXy — Permanent Mission of I.R.Iran to UN-Vienna (@PMIRAN_Vienna) February 8, 2022 Bagheri Kani is also scheduled to hold talks with chief negotiators of the P4+1 group of countries later in the day, IRNA reported. In a joint press conference with his Finnish counterpart, Pekka Haavisto, in Tehran on Monday, Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said despite progress in the talks, part of the Islamic Republic’s demands have not been taken into account yet. Asked about the latest developments regarding the negotiations in Vienna, Amir-Abdollahian said, “According to the latest texts of the Vienna talks, parts of our demands with regard to the removal of sanctions have not been addressed yet.” Trump unilaterally left the JCPOA in May 2018 and re-imposed the anti-Iran sanctions that the deal had lifted. He also placed additional sanctions on Iran under other pretexts not related to the nuclear case as part of his “maximum pressure” campaign. In May 2019, following a year of strategic patience, Iran decided to let go of some of the restrictions on its nuclear energy program, resorting to its legal rights under the JCPOA, which grants a party the right to suspend its contractual commitments in case of non-compliance by the other side. The US administration of President Joe Biden says it is willing to compensate for Trump’s mistake and rejoin the deal, but it has retained the sanctions as leverage. Iran, Russia FMs urge speedy revival of JCPOA in its initially balanced configuration In a phone call on Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Iranian counterpart stressed the need for the speedy revival of the JCPOA in its initially balanced configuration, which has been approved by the UN Security Council Resolution 2231. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Lavrov and Amir-Abdollahian discussed the situation around the JCPOA amid the ongoing sanctions removal talks in Vienna, Xinhua reported. The top Iranian and Russian diplomats also exchanged views on the recent visit of Iran's President Ebrahim Raeisi to Moscow and reassured their readiness to foster cooperation in a wide range of fields. Setting deadline for Vienna talks not constructive: China Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Tuesday that the negotiations on reviving compliance with the JCPOA have entered a crucial stage, dismissing the idea of setting a deadline for the talks. "China agrees that all parties should have a stronger sense of urgency, fully demonstrate goodwill and flexibility, and move toward reaching an agreement at an early date," he said at his regular press conference. "At the same time, we believe that it is not constructive to artificially set up a deadline for the negotiations," he added. The Chinese spokesman urged all JCPOA parties to exercise necessary patience, properly resolve differences and create favorable conditions for negotiations. He emphasized that the US, as the culprit of the crisis on the Iranian nuclear issue, should reverse its erroneous “maximum pressure” policy on Iran and lift all illegal sanctions on Tehran and third parties. Zhao also called on Iran to resume full compliance with the JCPOA and said, "China will continue to participate in negotiations constructively and work with all parties to bring the JCPOA back to the right track at an early date." Vienna talks now in final stages; diplomatic solution possible: Britain The director of Middle East and North Africa department at the British foreign and commonwealth office and chief negotiator to the Vienna talks, Stephanie Al-Qaq, said in a tweet that the Vienna talks on the JCPOA revival have reached "final stages.” Back in Vienna for #JCPOA #ViennaTalks. We are now in the final stages. A diplomatic solution is possible but will require us to reach decisions swiftly. @FCDOArabic — Stephanie Al-Qaq (@salqaq) February 8, 2022 "Back in Vienna for #JCPOA #ViennaTalks.

News article:
(MENAFN- IANS) Tehran, Feb 11 (IANS) Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has said dispatching a comprehensive team to the talks in Vienna on the restoration of the 2015 nuclear deal shows the Islamic Republic's serious will to pursue a diplomatic solution. Raisi made the remarks on Thursday during his meeting with foreign ambassadors to Iran on the occasion of the 43rd anniversary of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, according to the Iranian presidency's website. 'Everyone knows the Islamic Republic has never left the negotiating table and has always entered talks with determination and initiatives,' he added. He said the current situation regarding the 2015 nuclear agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is the consequence of US failure to honour its promises under the agreement and certain parties' inaction to the sanctions. The Iranian President stressed pursuing a diplomatic approach will be effective and sustainable only when all sides show commitment to it in practice, Xinhua news agency reported. Raisi noted that Iran has always highlighted the importance of peaceful coexistence and the establishment of appropriate and balanced relations with other countries without any foreign interference, as well as the need to pursue dynamic and constructive diplomacy to resolve regional and international problems. He said, using weapons of mass destruction is in no way part of Iran's military plans and defense doctrine, noting that 'we have always announced that our nuclear activities are solely focused on peaceful purposes and aimed at taking transparent and legal advantages from technology in energy, industry, agriculture and medical sectors'. --IANS int/khz/

Raisi noted that Iran has always highlighted the importance of peaceful coexistence and the establishment of appropriate and balanced relations with other countries without any foreign interference, as well as the need to pursue dynamic and constructive diplomacy to resolve regional and international problems. He said, using weapons of mass destruction is in no way part of Iran's military plans and defense doctrine, noting that 'we have always announced that our nuclear activities are solely focused on peaceful purposes and aimed at taking transparent and legal advantages from technology in energy, industry, agriculture and medical sectors'. --IANS int/khz/

News article:
Iran’s foreign minister tells the European Union’s foreign policy chief that lack of resolve to achieve a good deal in the Vienna talks on the revival of the 2015 Iran deal has caused the negotiations to become unnecessarily prolonged. Hossein Amir-Abdollahian made the remarks in a Monday phone call with Josep Borrell, during which the two diplomats discussed the latest situation of the ongoing negotiations in the Austrian capital. During the phone call, the Iranian foreign minister thanked Borrell and his deputy, Enrique Mora, who is also the head of the joint commission on the Iran deal, which is officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), for their efforts. “Some hasty measures, repetitive tampering with the text and lack of serious resolve for achieving a good and reliable agreement in Vienna by the Western sides have caused the negotiations to become unnecessarily protracted,” Iran’s top diplomat said. Pointing to "serious efforts" by Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani during the ongoing talks with the P4+1 group of countries in Vienna and "realistic" initiatives offered by the Iranian negotiating team, Amir-Abdollahian emphasized that any proposal offered by the other parties must take Tehran's legitimate rights and demands into consideration. "We will never back down from our red lines, which are based on logic and realism," he said. Envoys from Iran and the five remaining signatories to the deal -- Britain, France, Russia, and China plus Germany -- have been negotiating in the Austrian capital for 10 months with the aim of reviving the JCPOA through bringing the US back to the deal. The two sides have bridged some gaps since the talks began last year, but differences remain, especially on the issue of US sanctions. Tehran wants all sanctions imposed by the administration of former US President Donald Trump removed and says the issue is its red line. Addressing a joint press conference with his Irish counterpart earlier in the day, Amir-Abdollahian said it is possible to reach a good agreement on the JCPOA revival if the United States and the European signatories to the agreement -- Britain, France and Germany -- are serious about returning to full implementation of their commitments. He added, “We believe that if the American side and the three European countries [that are signatories to the JCPOA] are serious about returning to the full implementation of their commitments as per the JCPOA, achieving a good agreement will be possible in short term.” His remarks came after a source close to the Iranian delegation in the Vienna talks said on Saturday that Tehran has put many offers on the table and encouraged the other side to come up with new proposals to resolve the outstanding issues. "Also, it should be noted that the Iranian delegation has a clear mandate and negotiating instruction, and developments outside the scope of the talks in Vienna, have no effect on the negotiating stances of Iran," the source pointed out. Vienna talks at sensitive stage, all sides must help make progress: Borrell The senior EU official, for his part, hailed great efforts made so far by the negotiating teams of Iran and the P4+1 group of countries to salvage the JCPOA. He said the Vienna talks have reached a sensitive stage and all the participants must show flexibility and take the existing possibilities and limitations into account to help advance the negotiations. Amir-Abdollahian and Borrell agreed to continue close consultations to advance the Vienna talks, saying that the overall course of negotiations has been positive. Earlier on Monday, Iran's lead negotiator and the EU deputy foreign policy chief held a bilateral meeting in Vienna as the eighth round of talks between Tehran and the five remaining parties to the JCPOA is underway.

The Russian ministry's statement added that during the call, the two foreign ministers noted that there is a "tangible move forward" in reviving the Iran deal during the Vienna talks. Meanwhile, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman said during the conversation, Lavrov lauded Iran’s constructive initiatives during the Vienna talks and stressed the need for continuation of consultations among various parties in order to achieve a final agreement. Amir-Abdollahian, for his part, underlined the necessity of paying attention to Iran’s right to expect the opposite sides to abide by their commitments in case of any agreement.

News article:
(MENAFN- Trend News Agency) TEHRAN, Iran, Feb. 15 Trend : Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdolahian and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell had a phone call discussing the Vienna talks, Trend reports citing IRNA. During the phone call, Josep Borrell said it is necessary for all parties to help the talks move forward by showing flexibility, taking into account each other's capabilities and constraints. Hossein Amirabdolahian also said that the lack of serious will by other parties to reach a good and reliable agreement in Vienna has led to the unnecessary prolongation of Vienna talks. Both sides agreed to continue close consultations to move forward with the Vienna Talks. They also assessed the negotiations process as positive overall. In January 2016, JCPOA was launched between Iran and the P5+1 group (US, Russia, China, UK, France, and Germany) in connection with Iran's nuclear program. In May 2018, the US announced its withdrawal from the deal and imposed sanctions on Iran in November of the same year. To preserve the agreements reached as part of the JCPOA, the European signatories of the deal started in January 2019 that a financial mechanism for maintaining trade with Iran called INSTEX was formed. On May 8, 2019, Iran announced that it had ceased fulfilling its commitments regarding the sale of over 300 kilograms of uranium, as stated in the deal, basing its decision on the other signatories that have not fulfilled their obligations. On July 7, Iran announced that it will not be fulfilling its commitments regarding the enrichment of uranium at 3.67 percent and the reconstruction of the Arak Heavy Water Reactor Facility as stated in the deal. Iran announced that it will enrich uranium using next-generation centrifuges and will not mix it with the enriched uranium residues as part of the third step of reducing commitments in JCPOA on Sept.5. On Nov. 5, 2019, Iran announced that it took the fourth step in connection with reducing its commitments to the nuclear agreement. So, uranium gas is being pumped to the centrifuges at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant. On Jan.2020, Iran took the last fifth step in reducing the number of its commitments within JCPOA. As reported, in late 2020, the Iranian parliament has decided to implement a strategic plan to tackle the sanctions, citing the non-implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) signed between Iran and six countries and the imposition of sanctions on Iran. According to the decision of the Iranian parliament, as of February 23, Iran suspended the implementation of additional steps and an additional protocol provided for in the nuclear deal. The US imposed new sanctions on Iran in November 2018. Over the past period, the sanctions affected Iranian oil exports, more than 700 banks, companies, and individuals.

News article:
Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian says the Vienna talks are nearing a critical stage and that progress has been made in the process thanks to Tehran’s logical approach and initiative. During a telephone conversation with his British counterpart Liz Truss, Amir-Abdollahian called on the other participants to act earnestly and responsibly in order to reach the desired results at the talks. He stressed the need for reaching a consensus among all negotiating parties on a single text that would take into account the legitimate demands of the Islamic Republic. The eighth round of talks between Iran and the P4+1 group of countries resumed in the Austrian capital last Tuesday after a 10-day break. The two sides have bridged some gaps, but differences remain. The talks aim to bring the US back into full compliance with the 2015 Iran deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), almost four years after it unilaterally left the deal and took hostile measures – including the “toughest ever” sanctions – against Iran to destroy it. During the talks, Tehran has said it is committed to negotiating a “lasting, reliable agreement” in the shortest time possible, but insists that it will not be bound by “artificial deadlines.” Elsewhere during their phone conversation, Amir-Abdollahian and Truss also exchanged views on the current state of bilateral relations. The Iranian foreign minister evaluated the trend of ties between Tehran and London as “positive”. Referring to the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Yemen, he voiced hope that Britain would fulfill its responsibilities to end the catastrophe caused by the ongoing aggression against the impoverished country. Amir-Abdollahian further explained Iran’s principled position on Afghanistan and stressed the formation of an inclusive government in the Central Asian state and swift assistance to its people by the international community. UK debt to Iran The British foreign secretary, for her part, said that the growing relations between the UK and Iran serve the interests of both countries. She also expressed hope that Britain would be able to pay its debt to Iran in the near future. The UK’s debt to Iran is estimated to be as much as £400 million ($542 million), arising from the non-delivery of tanks ordered by Iran’s ousted monarch Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Additionally, Truss pointed to cooperation between London and the United Nations to help the Afghans, praising Iran’s effective role in this regard. She further offered condolences over the passing of Iran’s Ambassador to Sana’a Hassan Irloo. The envoy died in December 2021 of the COVID-19 complications after some Saudi officials delayed his return home for medical treatment.
