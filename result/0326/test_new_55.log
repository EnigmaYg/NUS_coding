News article:
The recent round of talks between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan concerning the disputed Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) has gotten off to a rough start after Khartoum skipped Monday's meeting in objection to "not receiving a response to its request to grant experts participating in the negotiations a greater role." After a one-month impasse, the three nations held a meeting on Sunday, agreeing to resume the talks under the brokerage of the AU for one week as of today, and to hold a follow-up meeting next Sunday, which will be attended by the three countries' irrigation and foreign ministers to review the outcome of the week-long round of talks. After Sudan's decision, today's meeting was terminated by Egypt, Ethiopia and the AU observers, according to a statement issued by the Egyptian irrigation ministry, which said that "the negotiations require the participation of the three parties to reach a legally-binding agreement on the rules of filling and operating the GERD." In an official statement, the Sudanese irrigation ministry said Khartoum voiced its reservation about participating in today's trilateral meeting without holding a bilateral meeting with AU's experts and observers on the same day. "Based on the outcomes of the trilateral ministerial meeting held on Sunday, Sudan asked for holding a bilateral meeting with the African Union's experts as well as observers in the evening of the same day, [but] Sudan did not receive a response to its request," the ministry added. The AU-mediated talks have been observed by representatives from the EU, the US, the AU, as well as legal and technical experts. “Sudan received an invitation to continue the direct trilateral negotiations, which prompted it to express its reservation about participating in [today's meeting]," the ministry said. The Sudanese side reasserted its position about the necessity of giving a bigger role to the AU's experts to facilitate negotiations and reconcile opinions. Also, the Sudanese irrigation ministry affirmed its adherence to the negotiation process under the aegis of the continental body in accordance with the principle of "African solutions to African problems," the statement added. According to the Egyptian irrigation ministry, the participating parties in today's meeting agreed to refer the matter to South Africa, the current chair of the AU, to review the coming steps during the anticipated six-member meeting between the three countries' irrigation and foreign ministers next Sunday. This is the second time Sudan has skipped AU-mediated meetings. In November, Sudan decided to not take part in a tripartite ministerial meeting that was scheduled to discuss guidelines for further negotiations, saying that the way previous talks were held proved to be "unproductive." Ethiopia and the African Union have yet not commented on Sudan’s step. Egypt and Sudan have been in talks with Ethiopia for a decade to reach a legally binding agreement on the filling and operating of the near-complete $4.8 billion mega dam. The GERD, built 15 kilometres from the Ethiopian border with Sudan, has been a source of contention between the three countries since its construction began in 2011. Cairo fears the project will significantly cut its crucial water supplies from the River Nile, while Sudan has concerns over how the reservoir will be managed. Ethiopia says the massive project, which it hopes will make it Africa’s largest power exporter, is key to its development efforts. Search Keywords: Short link:

A handout satellite image shows a closeup view of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and the Blue Nile River in Ethiopia (Reuters) Cairo, Khartoum- Mohammed Abdu Hassanein and Mohammed Amin Yassine Sudan announced it was not attending the new round of talks on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), in a new setback for the negotiation process led by the African Union (AU). The AU called Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan for a one-week round of negotiations on January 3 to discuss the GERD issue, after talks had been suspended for a month. A six-way meeting was also scheduled for the end of the week between foreign and irrigation ministers of the three countries, chaired by South Africa, current AU president, to consider the outcomes of the tripartite negotiations round. The Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation announced that Ethiopia sent an invitation for the meeting, which was also meant to include irrigation ministers, technical and legal delegations, and AU observers and experts. However, Sudan announced its reservation over participation in the Tripartite Ministerial Meeting, requesting a bilateral meeting with the AU experts and observers. Sudan’s Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources explained in a statement that it did not receive a response to its request, but received an invitation to resume the direct tripartite negotiations. “Instead of a reply to this request, Sudan received an invitation for a direct tripartite meeting, so it has expressed its reservations over participating in this meeting.” Khartoum reiterated its firm position on the necessity of giving a greater role to the Union experts to facilitate negotiations. Egypt agreed with Ethiopia to raise the matter to the South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, so that future steps will be discussed during the ministerial meeting, scheduled for January 10. The three countries have been engaged in strenuous negotiations for about 10 years to agree on mechanisms for operating and filling the dam, without yielding any results so far. Cairo and Khartoum want to reach an agreement before the second phase of filling the reservoir in a way that achieves the common interests of the three countries and secures Egypt's rights and water interests. Addis Ababa finished last July the first phase of filling the reservoir, in preparation for its operation, and the second phase is expected to begin next June. The negotiations are held with the participation of experts and observers from the US, EU, World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the African Union.

News article:
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia on Saturday summoned the U.S. ambassador over what it called an “incitement of war” between Ethiopia and Egypt from President Donald Trump over their dispute about the filling and operation of a massive hydropower dam. Slideshow ( 2 images ) Trump called on Friday for an agreement between the countries, but added it was a dangerous situation and that Cairo could end up “blowing up that dam”. Ethiopian Foreign Affairs Minister Gedu Andargachew summoned U.S. Ambassador to Addis Ababa Mike Raynor to seek clarifications on the comments. “The incitement of war between Ethiopia and Egypt from a sitting U.S. president neither reflects the longstanding partnership and strategic alliance between Ethiopia and the United States nor is acceptable in international law governing interstate relations,” Gedu’s ministry said in a statement. Trump made the comments during a call with Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok following Sudan and Israel’s announcement to normalise ties. Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt have been locked in a bitter dispute over the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which remains unresolved although the reservoir behind the dam began filling in July. Trump said on Friday he had brokered an agreement to resolve the issue but that Ethiopia had broken the pact, forcing him to cut funds, adding: “They will never see that money unless they adhere to the agreement ... You can’t blame Egypt for being a little upset.” He said he had also urged Egypt to resolve the dispute. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s office said earlier on Saturday: “Occasional statements of belligerent threats to have Ethiopia succumb to unfair terms still abound.” The first phase of filling the dam was completed in August, it said. Egypt says it is dependent on the Nile for more than 90% of its scarce fresh water supplies, and fears the dam could have a devastating effect on its economy. Abiy’s office said there had been significant progress made in resolving the dispute since the African Union took over the negotiations. “Now is the time for action and not for increasing tensions,” European Union’s European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said before the Ethiopian ministry issued its statement.

The image shows the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which is at the center of the dispute between Ethiopia and Egypt. The dam is being built on the Blue Nile River, which is a major source of water for both countries. Egypt fears that the dam will reduce the amount of water that flows into the Nile River, which could have a devastating impact on its economy. Ethiopia, on the other hand, says that the dam is essential for its development and that it will not harm Egypt. The image is highly related to the original news article, which discusses the dispute between Ethiopia and Egypt over the GERD. The image also depicts the specific event of the dam's construction, which is a key part of the dispute. Therefore, the relationship between the image and the news events set is aligned.

News article:
Khartoum insists on granting bigger role for experts participating in the talks as well as reaching a comprehensive and binding agreement The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) negotiations between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia are scheduled to resume on Sunday under the aegis of the African Union (AU), along with the participation of each country’s foreign and irrigation ministers. Sunday’s gathering is expected to look into Sudan’s absence from last week's talks and review the coming steps of the long-running standoff, which has been of concern to Cairo and Khartoum since 2011. Sudan skipped the meeting, according to an official statement released last week, in objection to not receiving a response to its demands of holding bilateral meetings between the AU experts participating in the negotiations and each of the three countries' representatives separately to discuss and identify points of differences while continuing to hold only trilateral meetings between the three countries' negotiating teams. The AU-mediated talks have been observed by representatives from the EU, the US, the AU, as well as legal and technical experts. Only 24 hours before Sunday's six-member meeting, Sudan called for the AU to play a leading and more effective role in the negotiations, which the continental body has been mediating. The call came during a meeting held on Saturday between the Sudanese negotiating team and the AU experts' team participating in the talks that are being held. During the bilateral meeting, the Sudanese side called for granting experts a bigger role and establishing a clear frame of reference for their role, the Sudanese official news agency SUNA reported. Sudan affirmed the need for the AU to “play a leading” and “effective” role more than it had been doing during the previous rounds of negotiations, SUNA added. The team reiterated the necessity of reaching a comprehensive and binding agreement on the rule of filling and operating the dam, that includes clear mechanisms for settling potential disputes. The Sudanese government warned that it would withdraw from Sunday's meeting if its demand of granting a bigger role for experts will not be met, the Saudi-owned new website Asharq reported, citing Sudanese diplomatic sources. The GERD, built 15 kilometres from the Ethiopian border with Sudan, has been a source of contention between the three countries since its construction began in 2011. Cairo fears the project will significantly cut its crucial water supplies from the River Nile, while Sudan has concerns over how the reservoir will be managed. Ethiopia says the massive project - which it hopes will make it Africa’s largest power exporter - is key to its development efforts. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Khartoum insists on granting bigger role for experts participating in the talks as well as reaching a comprehensive and binding agreement The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) negotiations between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia are scheduled to resume on Sunday under the aegis of the African Union (AU), along with the participation of each country’s foreign and irrigation ministers. Sunday’s gathering is expected to look into Sudan’s absence from last week's talks and review the coming steps of the long-running standoff, which has been of concern to Cairo and Khartoum since 2011. Sudan skipped the meeting, according to an official statement released last week, in objection to not receiving a response to its demands of holding bilateral meetings between the AU experts participating in the negotiations and each of the three countries' representatives separately to discuss and identify points of differences while continuing to hold only trilateral meetings between the three countries' negotiating teams. The AU-mediated talks have been observed by representatives from the EU, the US, the AU, as well as legal and technical experts. Only 24 hours before Sunday's six-member meeting, Sudan called for the AU to play a leading and more effective role in the negotiations, which the continental body has been mediating. The call came during a meeting held on Saturday between the Sudanese negotiating team and the AU experts' team participating in the talks that are being held. During the bilateral meeting, the Sudanese side called for granting experts a bigger role and establishing a clear frame of reference for their role, the Sudanese official news agency SUNA reported. Sudan affirmed the need for the AU to “play a leading” and “effective” role more than it had been doing during the previous rounds of negotiations, SUNA added. The team reiterated the necessity of reaching a comprehensive and binding agreement on the rule of filling and operating the dam, that includes clear mechanisms for settling potential disputes. The Sudanese government warned that it would withdraw from Sunday's meeting if its demand of granting a bigger role for experts will not be met, the Saudi-owned new website Asharq reported, citing Sudanese diplomatic sources. The GERD, built 15 kilometres from the Ethiopian border with Sudan, has been a source of contention between the three countries since its construction began in 2011. Cairo fears the project will significantly cut its crucial water supplies from the River Nile, while Sudan has concerns over how the reservoir will be managed. Ethiopia says the massive project - which it hopes will make it Africa’s largest power exporter - is key to its development efforts. Search Keywords: Short link:

Sudan reiterated the necessity of reaching a legally binding agreement on the rules for filling and operating the near-complete dam to preserve the interests of all three nations Khartoum has said it "will not accept the imposition of a fait accompli policy" in the dispute caused by the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), referring to Ethiopia's intention to embark on the second filling of the dam's reservoir in July despite a lack of agreement with downstream countries Egypt and Sudan. Prime Minister Abdullah Hamdok and the Sudanese higher committee for following up on the GERD developments held a meeting on Monday, where it was stated that risking the safety of 20 million Sudanese whose lives rely on the Blue Nile is unacceptable. The meeting reiterated Sudan’s stance on the necessity of reaching a legally binding agreement on the rules for filling and operating the near-complete dam to preserve the interests of all three nations, Sudanese news agency SUNA reported. Also, the meeting dealt with the potential hazards of Ethiopia's anticipated step to start the second filling of the dam in July without reaching an agreement. The meeting highlighted the consequences of this step, if it happens, on the safety of the operation of the Sudanese Roseires Dam, which is located close to the GERD, and other water facilities in the country. In a step that angered Sudan and Egypt, Addis Ababa declared last summer that it had achieved the first-year filling (4.9 billion cubic metres) during the rainy season flooding of the Blue Nile. Days following the move by Ethiopia, Sudan announced that it had recorded a decline in water levels on the Blue Nile coming from Ethiopia. Both downstream countries have repeatedly reiterated their rejection of taking any unilateral action without reaching a binding agreement. Khartoum and Cairo have been in talks with Addis Ababa for a decade to reach a legally binding agreement on the filling and operating of the $4.8 billion mega-dam, which has been under construction on the Blue Nile since 2011. The Sudanese remarks come almost two weeks after Sudanese Irrigation Minister Yasser Abbas sent a letter to the African Union (AU), the current mediator of the dam negotiations, expressing his country’s grave concerns over Addis Ababa's announcement that it would go on with the second filling of the GERD in the summer of 2021. Monday's talks, attended by Sudan's cabinet members and directors of the General Intelligence Service and Military Intelligence, came a week after the latest round of GERD talks failed to resolve the differences between the three countries. The talks tackled alternative options after the halt of the AU negotiations, according to SUNA. The last round of negotiations came to a standstill over Sudan’s withdrawal due to its rejection of the methodology upon which the negotiations were held, calling for a bigger role by the experts assigned by the AU to reconcile opinions instead of the direct trilateral talks.

The Chinese-funded dam project in Africa may lead to regional instability American Thinker ^ | 01/20/2021 | Andrea Widburg Posted on by SeekAndFind A potentially dangerous regional war may be developing in Northeast Africa thanks to the Chinese-funded Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). It seems that, wherever people grab onto Chinese money, despair follows. The Nile is the longest river in Africa and may be the longest in the world. (The Amazon competes with it for that title.) While Egypt’s historic prominence means that most people instinctively associate the Nile with that country, the great river actually runs through eleven nations. The White Nile begins in Rwanda or Burundi, flowing north through Tanzania, Uganda, and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins in Ethiopia, flowing north into Sudan, where it joins White Nile at Khartoum. The main river itself then flows into Egypt, ending at the Mediterranean. (The other nations it touches are Congo, Kenya, and Tanzania.) The almost-completed GERD project spans the Blue Nile in Ethiopia, and will ultimately hold 74 billion cubic meters of water. Filling the dam started last summer and could take as many as 15 years to complete. The dam’s purpose is electricity. The $5 billion project (which includes $1.2 billion in financing from China) will ultimately bring millions of Ethiopians into the 21st century. That sounds laudable, but the Egyptians and Sudanese are extremely worried: The Chinese-financed Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), despite a recent breakdown in talks on Africa’s largest development project, risks powering up a range of downstream tensions and rivalries. These run from rising rivalry between Egypt and Ethiopia to a festering border war between Ethiopia and neighboring Sudan. At stake, too, is the future of almost 90% of the water in Nile River, the world’s longest waterway.

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

  irrelevent.

The image shows the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) under construction. The dam is being built by Ethiopia on the Blue Nile River, which is a tributary of the Nile River. The Nile River is the longest river in the world and it flows through Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia. The GERD is a controversial project because it is being built without the consent of Egypt and Sudan. Egypt and Sudan are concerned that the dam will reduce the amount of water that flows into their countries. The GERD is also a major source of tension between Ethiopia and Egypt.

American blood will be sacrificed and material wealth squandered. To: SeekAndFind Belt and Road Initiative is basically meant to help move millions of Chinese out of China and expand into other countries. The rest is just window dressing. by 5 posted onby PIF (They came for me and mine ... now its your turn) To: SeekAndFind Why didn’t the EPA come down on THAT idea? by 6 posted onby SMARTY (“If you have ten thousand regulations, you destroy all respect for the law.” Winston Churchill) To: SeekAndFind Generating electric power by dams. How politically incorrect. I would have thought that the UN and the US environmentalists would have insisted that Ethopia use only windmills and solar collectors to develop and move into the 21st century. It seems that hydro dams and coal fired plants are still needed to modernize a country and provide relatively inexpensive and RELIABLE electrical energy. To: Gen.Blather “Egypt thinks they own all the warer and has refused to negotiate. This is a problem that can be resolved but for Egyptian recalcitrance.” Doesn’t matter, at this point. Egypt has 100M people now, and 98% (or whatever) of their water is from the Nile. If a ‘solution’ to this issue is not found, it’s difficult to see Egypt (or any other government in a similar situation) not go to war. by 8 posted onby BobL (I shop at Walmart and eat at McDonald's, I just don't tell anyone.) To: SeekAndFind Yeah, that Three Gorges Dam is holding up so well. To: Maine Mariner It is quite possible that the US refused funding due to those “environmental concerns”. The Chinese have no such precious scruples. To: SeekAndFind Egypt needs only to review the control of Klamath water. To: hinckley buzzard Exactly. But now China will have more political and economic influence and power in that region. Naser wanted to built the Aswan dam; the U.S. opposed it; the USSR supported it. Guess who had more influence in that part of the Near East for many years. To: BobL The dam can be completely filled in anywhere from three to ten years. Obviously, Ethiopia, which faces periodic famine due to drought, would like it sooner. Ethiopia has offered to share the power generated with Sudan and Egypt. If I recall, Israel has offered to help Egypt with the water problem, probably by building desalinization plants. Egypt does have several options that will minimize the impact, but the government simply wants to keep things the way they are now. When the British controlled the headwaters they agreed to not dam the river, giving Egypt veto power over any projects. That was nearly a century ago. If the Ethiopian government does not fill up the dam, then they will probably be replaced by a government that will. The present government has been, apparently, very reasonable. But they have also placed anti-air weapons around the dam and they have to answer to people who face starvation. (I looked at photos of the antiair weapons. Egypt probably wouldn’t lose any planes to them. However, bombing a dam that has been more than a decade in development would probably cause them diplomatic headaches. Also, it’s entirely possible that trying to destroy it and failing would be a disaster.) If cutting off the flow of water into another country is a cause of war, you should see the Rio Grande as it goes into Mexico.

News article:
Sudan has kicked off intense diplomatic efforts to resume the stalled negotiations on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. (Reuters) Khartoum - Mohammed Amin Yassin Sudan has kicked off intense diplomatic efforts to resume the stalled negotiations on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) to mobilize regional and international support for its position. Sudanese Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Yasir Abbas held three separate meetings with the ambassadors of the UK, France and Russia to Khartoum. He briefed them on the latest developments in the negotiations in the past six months and his country’s stance, which calls for resolving disputes through serious dialogue. Sudanese officials are also expected to tour some regional countries to garner support for their position. The British Ambassador, Irfan Siddiq, vowed to help the three countries involved – Sudan, Ethiopia and Egypt - reach a satisfactory agreement. Khartoum has hinted it would resort to alternative options since talks for nearly a decade over the operation and filling of the mega-dam have faltered. Meanwhile, Sudan’s High Committee to follow up on the GERD met Monday to discuss the threats posed by the dam’s second filling and its impact on the safety and operation of the nearby Roseires dam and other water facilities. Headed by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, the committee stressed that it will not accept the de facto policy, which threatens its citizens and water installations on the Blue Nile. Ethiopia is determined to fill the reservoir with 13.5 million cubic meters of water in July, whether an agreement is reached or not. It had first filled the reservoir in 2020. Sudanese officials have expressed their disappointment with the African Union mediation in the dispute, which has made little progress since taking over the file in July 2020. They highlighted the difficulties faced by the AU in persuading Cairo and Addis Ababa to respond to Khartoum’s request to expand the role of experts to bridge divides between the countries. The three Nile Valley countries agree on the importance of reaching an agreement on the GERD, but there are some obstacles that hinder achieving this goal, an official source told Asharq Al-Awsat. He cited the upcoming elections in Ethiopia as one such obstacle. The official further explained that Sudan’s alternative options are mainly its latest diplomatic moves and contacts with Addis Ababa and Cairo. These moves will lead to positive pressure that will help overcome the disputes, he stressed, adding that his country does not oppose any proposal on expanding the role of African experts chosen by the AU.

CAIRO (Reuters) - The Egyptian foreign ministry summoned the Ethiopian Chargé d’Affairs to Cairo on Wednesday to provide clarifications over comments made by the spokesman of the Ethiopian foreign ministry, it said. The comments “addressed” Egyptian internal affairs, the ministry added without providing more details. It was not immediately clear what comments had angered Egypt. Egyptian officials were not immediately available to comment. However, Qatar’s Al Jazeera Media Network reported earlier today that Dina Mufti, the Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesperson, attacked Cairo for criticizing a giant dam that Addis Ababa is building on the Blue Nile and using the project to cover several internal problems. Reuters could not immediately verify the translation of his comments by Al Jazeera. Negotiations between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan failed so far to end a bitter dispute between the three countries over the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) even after the reservoir behind the dam began filling in July. Egypt, which gets more than 90% of its scarce fresh water from the Nile fears the multi-billion dollar dam could devastate its economy.

The image shows the leaders of Egypt and Ethiopia, who are the main parties involved in the news events set. The image was taken at a previous event, but it is still relevant to the current news events set because it shows the two leaders together and smiling, which suggests that they are on good terms. This is in contrast to the current news events set, which is about a dispute between the two countries. The image therefore provides some background information that helps to explain the current news events set.

News article:
NAIROBI (Reuters) - Ethiopia warned Sudan on Tuesday it was running out of patience with its neighbour’s continued military build-up in a disputed border area despite attempts to diffuse tensions with diplomacy. The decades-old dispute over al-Fashqa, land within Sudan’s international boundaries that has long been settled by Ethiopian farmers, erupted into weeks of clashes between forces from both sides late last year. “The Sudanese side seems to be pushing in so as to inflame the situation on the ground,” Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesman Dina Mufti told reporters. “Is Ethiopia going to start a war? Well, we are saying let’s work on diplomacy.” “How long will Ethiopia continue to resolve the issue using diplomacy? Well, there is nothing that has no limit. Everything has a limit,” he told a briefing in Addis Ababa. Sudan’s information minister and government spokesman Feisal Mohamed Saleh said the country did not want war with Ethiopia but its forces would respond to any aggression. “We fear that these comments contain a hostile position towards Sudan. We ask of Ethiopia to stop attacking Sudanese territory and Sudanese farmers,” he told Reuters. Sudan said on Dec. 31 that it had taken control of all of Sudanese territory in the area. Ethiopia says Sudan took advantage of its forces being distracted by the Tigray conflict to occupy Ethiopian land and loot properties. The United Nations said in a report last week on the humanitarian situation in Tigray that there were reports of a military build-up on both sides of the border around the area. The border tensions come at a time when Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt are also trying to resolve a three-way row over Ethiopia’s Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Ethiopia sees the dam as key to plans to become Africa’s largest power exporter. Egypt, which gets more than 90% of its scarce fresh water from the Nile, fears the dam across the Blue Nile could devastate its economy. Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan said on Sunday that they reached a new impasse in the dispute. Egypt and Ethiopia separately blamed Sudanese objections to the framework for the talks. On Tuesday, Ethiopia’s Dina criticised both Egypt and Sudan for delaying the negotiations. “Are the two speaking the same language? More or less. The two are speaking the same language when it comes to stalling it.”

Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam is seen as it undergoes construction work on the river Nile in Guba Woreda, Benishangul Gumuz Region, Ethiopia September 26, 2019. REUTERS/Tiksa Negeri/File Photo Cairo - Mohammed Abdo Hasanein The Egyptian embassy in Vienna held a seminar in cooperation with the Diplomatic Academy to address the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) issue. The event is part of Cairo's intensified diplomatic efforts to pressure Ethiopia to reach an agreement. Spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ambassador Ahmed Hafez said the seminar aims to highlight the threats posed by the Dam on Egypt and Sudan and to find a way to reach a fair deal that would guarantee the rights of all sides. The event was attended by representatives from international organizations and UN officials in Austria, as well as an elite of experts and academics. Egypt and Sudan are concerned that their share of the Nile waters will be impacted due to the recurrent filling of the GERD, as well as other consequences. The three countries have been holding negotiations to resolve the dispute over the GERD for about ten years, without reaching an agreement despite the involvement of the United States, World Bank and African Union. This comes days after Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry asserted his country does not negotiate for the sake of negotiating, stressing that Egypt will not accept the consolidation of the status quo on the ground. Egypt will not be a hostage to the efforts to impose hegemony on the Nile River, he declared before parliament. In this context, Egyptian Minister of Water Resources Mohamed Abdel Aty has urged for the acceleration of the procedures necessary to shifting from flood irrigation to modern irrigation systems. He called for focusing on success stories that could motivate farmers to adopt modern techniques.

Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam is seen as it undergoes construction work on the river Nile in Guba Woreda, Benishangul Gumuz Region, Ethiopia September 26, 2019. REUTERS/Tiksa Negeri/File Photo Cairo - Mohammed Abdo Hasanein The Egyptian embassy in Vienna held a seminar in cooperation with the Diplomatic Academy to address the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) issue. The event is part of Cairo's intensified diplomatic efforts to pressure Ethiopia to reach an agreement. Spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ambassador Ahmed Hafez said the seminar aims to highlight the threats posed by the Dam on Egypt and Sudan and to find a way to reach a fair deal that would guarantee the rights of all sides. The event was attended by representatives from international organizations and UN officials in Austria, as well as an elite of experts and academics. Egypt and Sudan are concerned that their share of the Nile waters will be impacted due to the recurrent filling of the GERD, as well as other consequences. The three countries have been holding negotiations to resolve the dispute over the GERD for about ten years, without reaching an agreement despite the involvement of the United States, World Bank and African Union. This comes days after Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry asserted his country does not negotiate for the sake of negotiating, stressing that Egypt will not accept the consolidation of the status quo on the ground. Egypt will not be a hostage to the efforts to impose hegemony on the Nile River, he declared before parliament. In this context, Egyptian Minister of Water Resources Mohamed Abdel Aty has urged for the acceleration of the procedures necessary to shifting from flood irrigation to modern irrigation systems. He called for focusing on success stories that could motivate farmers to adopt modern techniques.

CAIRO: The Arab League said on Tuesday that it supports the rights of Egypt and Sudan in the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) dispute, warning Ethiopia about rising tensions over the issue. It also said that Ethiopia “must deal rationally” to protect Egyptian and Sudanese rights in the dispute. Ahmed Aboul Gheit, secretary-general of the body, expressed his appreciation of the role played by the African Union in sponsoring negotiations between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia regarding GERD. “We hope that these negotiations will lead to their desired goal, which is to reach a legal, binding and fair agreement that takes into account the interests of all parties and organizes the process of filling and operating the dam, preserving the water rights of Egypt and Sudan,” he said during the ninth General Cooperation meeting between the African Union Commission and the League of Arab States. “Ethiopia must deal rationally to ensure the rights of Sudan and Egypt in the waters of the Nile. The Arab League has a resolution to support the rights of Egypt and Sudan in the waters of the Nile,” he added. Ethiopia had accused Egypt and Sudan of obstructing negotiations and responded to rumors of an imminent conflict over Nile waters. “The prediction about the outbreak of a war over the waters of the Nile is wrong … it is a factor in strengthening and developing the Nile Basin countries,” Ethiopian Minister of Irrigation Seleshi Bekele said in statements to Al-Jazeera. The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the six-party meeting held on Jan. 10 to discuss the dam failed to achieve any progress, while Sudan warned that discussions cannot continue indefinitely, given the threat posed by the dam. The Sudanese government also warned against a second filling of the dam before an agreement is reached. The country said it cannot accept the imposition of a de facto policy that threatens the safety of 20 million Sudanese citizens who depend on the Blue Nile. Sudan stressed the need for a binding legal agreement on filling and operating the dam that preserves and takes into account the interests of all three parties.

Cairo - Mohammed Abdo Hassanein Egypt has continued its international diplomatic efforts to move forward the stalled talks on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), hoping to pressure Ethiopia to reach a legally binding agreement on regulating the dam’s filling and operation. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi received on Tuesday his Congolese counterpart Felix Tshisekedi, the next president of the African Union (AU), which has been sponsoring talks between Cairo, Khartoum and Addis Ababa since July 2020. According to presidential spokesperson Bassam Rady, they discussed the latest regional developments, especially the GERD issue, and agreed to bolster coordination and joint consultation. Sisi highlighted Egypt’s position that “the Nile River is a source of cooperation and development and a lifeline that links peoples of the Nile Basin countries.” Leaders held individual discussions followed by expanded discussions between both countries’ delegations, the presidential statement noted. The statement quoted Tshisekedi as expressing appreciation for the distinguished historic relations with Egypt and the sincere and firm Egyptian political support for Congo. He stressed his country’s keenness to develop these relations in various fields, especially trade and economic cooperation. Meanwhile, the Egyptian embassy in Washington held on Monday an expanded virtual session with Congress aides from the House and Senate. During the session, Ambassador Motaz Zahran reviewed the GERD’s “negative impact” on Egypt and Sudan’s water security. Cairo is not opposed to Ethiopia's right to development, provided that its aspirations do not affect Egyptian interests and water security, Zahran stressed. The meeting aims to provide an accurate explanation to Congress members on Egypt’s stance on the negotiations. Cairo and Khartoum stress the need to reach a binding and comprehensive agreement that guarantees the rights and interests of the three countries, and include a mechanism for settling disputes filling and operation of the dam. They fear the potential negative impact of GERD on the flow of their annual share of the Nile’s 55.5 billion cubic meters of water. The GERD dispute has taken two courses of so far faltered negotiations. The first was mediated by the US, the World Bank and European Union observers in early 2020 and the second by the AU.

News article:
Sudan has recently started to state clearly that a legally binding solution is the only way out of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) crisis and Khartoum will not accept a second filling of the dam in the absence of an agreement, noted a diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity. He added that “Addis Ababa has always found a reason for procrastination and will use its current internal problems in the Tigray region together with mounting tension with Sudan” to continue along the same path, despite Khartoum’s position growing closer to Cairo’s. That Sudan had now joined Egypt in stating unequivocally that a legally binding agreement is the only way out of the dam impasse is unlikely to shift Addis Ababa’s position, says Abbas Sharaki, professor of geology and water resources at Cairo University. For that to happen, he argues, Egypt and Sudan need to unify their stand across the dam file. Egypt also reiterated its position on the dam this week when President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi repeated Cairo’s longstanding position that a legally-binding agreement is needed to resolve the crisis during a meeting in Cairo with the chairperson of the African Union (AU) Commission Moussa Faki. Faki was in Egypt to exchange views with Cairo on a range of African issues, including the upcoming AU Summit scheduled for 6 and 7 February, and the commission’s leadership elections which will be held on the periphery of the summit. Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri held a separate meeting with Faki during which he stressed Egypt’s continued willingness to engage in serious negotiations in order to reach a legally binding agreement, provided it is matched by a similar commitment on the Ethiopian side. Speaking to the newly-elected House of Representatives last week about the latest developments over GERD, Shoukri underlined that Egypt will not allow anyone to impose de facto policies or control the Nile. He told MPs that Cairo had managed to involve the international community in the dam file, one result of which was the unprecedented UN Security Council session in June 2020 addressing the dispute. Last week, Sudan’s acting Foreign Minister Omar Qamareddin told the media that “a binding agreement that regulates the filling and operating of the dam is a must,” a position that Khartoum is increasingly keen to explain to the world. Last week, it held a series of meetings with foreign ambassadors in Khartoum, including representatives of UN Security Council permanent member states. Continuing the diplomatic push, this week Sudan’s Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Yasser Abbas met the German and Spanish ambassadors to Khartoum. Late last month, Abbas and Qamareddin visited the Congolese capital Kinshasa where they met with Felix Antoine Cheskidy, president of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The DRC will take over the chairmanship of the AU from South Africa during this weekend’s AU summit. During their meeting, the Sudanese officials said Khartoum was ready to continue with the AU-mediated tripartite negotiations. Cheskidy, in turn, said he would discuss the issue with Egypt and Ethiopia in an attempt to close the gap between the three parties. Political analysts question whether the Congo can succeed in pushing forward a deal on the dam, something South Africa failed to do during last year’s AU-mediated talks. Sharaki is far from optimistic, not least because “the AU lacks a strong mechanism to impose its resolutions its member states.” Hani Raslan, an expert on African affairs at Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, argues that however differently Congo manages the file it is unlikely to lead to an agreement. “Ethiopia has already rejected the mediation of the World Bank and the US. What we now need is concerted international pressure, from the US and influential European states, especially those involved in the building of the dam, like Italy and the UK. If the international will is there, Addis Ababa will have to respond,” says Raslan. Sudan withdrew twice from the AU-mediated talks called by South Africa, demanding a greater role for AU experts in mediating the dispute, and claiming the current negotiating approach had rendered the talks redundant. Although both Egypt and Sudan have said repeatedly they cannot accept a second filling before an agreement is reached, Addis Ababa insists it will go ahead and fill the reservoir this summer regardless of whether an agreement is in place. Ethiopia’s Irrigation Minister Selshi Bekele tweeted this week that “construction progresses as scheduled. Support of Ethiopians for GERD at home and abroad is at its climax. We shall deliver this clean energy for the prosperity of Ethiopia and Africa.” The first filling of the dam’s reservoir took place last summer despite the absence of a binding agreement, a move that angered Cairo and Khartoum, both of whom saw it as a violation of the Declaration of Principles (DoP) signed in Sudan in March 2015. The DoP states that the three countries must first agree on guidelines and rules for the operating processes of the dam before filling the reservoir. The dam, 15km from the Ethiopian border with Sudan, has been a source of contention between the three countries since construction began in 2011. *A version of this article appears in print in the 4 February , 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

He added that “Addis Ababa has always found a reason for procrastination and will use its current internal problems in the Tigray region together with mounting tension with Sudan” to continue along the same path, despite Khartoum’s position growing closer to Cairo’s. That Sudan had now joined Egypt in stating unequivocally that a legally binding agreement is the only way out of the dam impasse is unlikely to shift Addis Ababa’s position, says Abbas Sharaki, professor of geology and water resources at Cairo University. For that to happen, he argues, Egypt and Sudan need to unify their stand across the dam file. Egypt also reiterated its position on the dam this week when President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi repeated Cairo’s longstanding position that a legally-binding agreement is needed to resolve the crisis during a meeting in Cairo with the chairperson of the African Union (AU) Commission Moussa Faki. Faki was in Egypt to exchange views with Cairo on a range of African issues, including the upcoming AU Summit scheduled for 6 and 7 February, and the commission’s leadership elections which will be held on the periphery of the summit. Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri held a separate meeting with Faki during which he stressed Egypt’s continued willingness to engage in serious negotiations in order to reach a legally binding agreement, provided it is matched by a similar commitment on the Ethiopian side. Speaking to the newly-elected House of Representatives last week about the latest developments over GERD, Shoukri underlined that Egypt will not allow anyone to impose de facto policies or control the Nile. He told MPs that Cairo had managed to involve the international community in the dam file, one result of which was the unprecedented UN Security Council session in June 2020 addressing the dispute. Last week, Sudan’s acting Foreign Minister Omar Qamareddin told the media that “a binding agreement that regulates the filling and operating of the dam is a must,” a position that Khartoum is increasingly keen to explain to the world. Last week, it held a series of meetings with foreign ambassadors in Khartoum, including representatives of UN Security Council permanent member states. Continuing the diplomatic push, this week Sudan’s Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Yasser Abbas met the German and Spanish ambassadors to Khartoum. Late last month, Abbas and Qamareddin visited the Congolese capital Kinshasa where they met with Felix Antoine Cheskidy, president of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The DRC will take over the chairmanship of the AU from South Africa during this weekend’s AU summit. During their meeting, the Sudanese officials said Khartoum was ready to continue with the AU-mediated tripartite negotiations. Cheskidy, in turn, said he would discuss the issue with Egypt and Ethiopia in an attempt to close the gap between the three parties. Political analysts question whether the Congo can succeed in pushing forward a deal on the dam, something South Africa failed to do during last year’s AU-mediated talks. Sharaki is far from optimistic, not least because “the AU lacks a strong mechanism to impose its resolutions its member states.” Hani Raslan, an expert on African affairs at Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, argues that however differently Congo manages the file it is unlikely to lead to an agreement. “Ethiopia has already rejected the mediation of the World Bank and the US. What we now need is concerted international pressure, from the US and influential European states, especially those involved in the building of the dam, like Italy and the UK. If the international will is there, Addis Ababa will have to respond,” says Raslan. Sudan withdrew twice from the AU-mediated talks called by South Africa, demanding a greater role for AU experts in mediating the dispute, and claiming the current negotiating approach had rendered the talks redundant. Although both Egypt and Sudan have said repeatedly they cannot accept a second filling before an agreement is reached, Addis Ababa insists it will go ahead and fill the reservoir this summer regardless of whether an agreement is in place. Ethiopia’s Irrigation Minister Selshi Bekele tweeted this week that “construction progresses as scheduled. Support of Ethiopians for GERD at home and abroad is at its climax. We shall deliver this clean energy for the prosperity of Ethiopia and Africa.” The first filling of the dam’s reservoir took place last summer despite the absence of a binding agreement, a move that angered Cairo and Khartoum, both of whom saw it as a violation of the Declaration of Principles (DoP) signed in Sudan in March 2015. The DoP states that the three countries must first agree on guidelines and rules for the operating processes of the dam before filling the reservoir. The dam, 15km from the Ethiopian border with Sudan, has been a source of contention between the three countries since construction began in 2011. *A version of this article appears in print in the 4 February , 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
(Adds details, background) By Khalid Abdelaziz KHARTOUM, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Any unilateral step by Ethiopia to fill its hydropower project, called the Renaissance Dam, in July would directly threaten Sudan's national security, Sudanese Irrigation and Water Resources Minister Yasser Abbas said on Saturday. Sudan is also proposing a mediation role for the United States, European Union, United Nations and African Union as a way of breaking the deadlock in talks about the dam between Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia, Abbas told Reuters in an interview. His comments come at a time of increased tension between Sudan and Ethiopia over disputed farmland near their shared border. This is on top of tension over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which Ethiopia is building on the Blue Nile, close to the border with Sudan. Ethiopia began filling the reservoir behind the dam after the summer rains last year despite demands from Egypt and Sudan that it should first reach a binding agreement on the dam's operation. Egypt views the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam as a major threat to its fresh water supplies, more than 90% of which come from the Nile. The Blue Nile flows north into Sudan then Egypt and is the Nile's main tributary. Ethiopia says the dam is crucial to its economic development. "The filling of the Renaissance Dam by one side next July represents a direct threat to Sudan's national security," said Abbas. He said unilateral filling of the reservoir threatened electricity generation from Sudan's Merowe Dam and Roseires Dam, as well as the safety of the Roseires Dam and of 20 million Sudanese living downstream of the GERD. Sudanese drinking water stations could also be put at risk, he added. The African Union has convened recent negotiations over the GERD between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt but talks have repeatedly stalled. Talks hosted by the United States last year also failed to secure a deal. "Sudan is now leading a diplomatic and political campaign to clarify its position and reach a legal and binding solution," Abbas said. "We are optimistic that if there is political will, a mutually agreed solution can be reached."

Any unilateral step by Ethiopia to fill its Dam in July would directly threaten Sudan's national security, Sudanese Irrigation and Water Resources Minister Yasser Abbas said Sudan warned Ethiopia Saturday against going ahead with the second phase of filling its mega dam on the Blue Nile, saying it would pose a "direct threat to Sudanese national security". "If Ethiopia goes ahead with filling the renaissance dam next July, this will be a direct threat to our national security," Sudan's Water Minister Yasser Abbas told AFP in an interview in the capital Khartoum. "It will also threaten the lives of half the population in central Sudan, as well as irrigation water for agricultural projects and power generation from (Sudan's) Roseires Dam." Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia have been locked in inconclusive talks for nearly a decade over the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, after Addis Ababa broke ground on the project in 2011. Ethiopia, which says it has already reached its first-year target for filling the dam's reservoir, has recently signalled it would proceed with the filling regardless of whether a deal was struck. Khartoum hopes the dam will regulate annual flooding, but fears that its own dams, including the Roseires and Merowe, would be harmed if no agreement is reached. "It will be impossible to operate the Roseires Dam without a binding agreement and daily exchange of information on the amount of water flowing from the renaissance dam," Abbas said. Without a deal, the minister added, the "Merowe Dam will also lose 30 percent of the electric energy it generates and drinking water stations will be affected". Sudan has suggested mediation by the United Nations, the African Union, the European Union and the United States to help break the impasse. The latest three-way talks were held last month in the presence of observers from the African Union and European Union, but failed to make headway. Relations between Addis Ababa and Khartoum have been sour in recent weeks following tensions over the Al-Fashaqa border region, where Ethiopian farmers cultivate fertile land claimed by Sudan.

News article:
Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam is seen as it undergoes construction work on the Nile River in Guba Woreda, Benishangul Gumuz Region, Ethiopia, Sept. 26, 2019. (Reuters) Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat Ethiopia is rapidly advancing in building the Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile, in clear defiance of Egypt’s warnings that require a binding agreement on the rules of filling and operating the dam to avoid an expected shortfall in its water share. The construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) has reached 78.3 percent, a jump from 74 percent in June 2020, according to Ethiopia’s Ministry of Water, Energy and Irrigation. In a press briefing on Sunday, Minister of Water, Irrigation, and Energy Sileshi Bekele said the performance attained during the past six months is the fastest since the commencement of construction in 2011. Authorities started filling the reservoir on July 21, 2020. However, the completion of the first filling phase prior to reaching an agreement with Egypt and Sudan irked both countries. The dam is expected to hold 13.5 billion cubic meters of water in the upcoming rainy season, said Bekele, adding that of the total 13 power generating turbines, two will also start production during the same period. Cairo and Khartoum stress the need to reach a binding and comprehensive agreement that guarantees the rights and interests of the three countries, and includes a mechanism for settling disputes on filling and operation of the dam. They fear the potential negative impact of GERD on the flow of their annual share of the Nile’s 55.5 billion cubic meters of water. In television statements on Saturday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi stressed that his country is “fighting in the negotiations to protect the Egyptian people’s rights.” “Patience will bring the desired results,” he added. The African Union (AU) has been sponsoring the so far faltered talks between Cairo, Addis Ababa and Khartoum since July 2020, despite the intervention of international actors such as the United States and the European Union with observers. Egypt hopes the new AU leadership would push forward the stalled talks. Sisi stressed his country’s keenness to resolve the issue through “serious negotiations to enhance regional security, stability and development.” Saturday marked the official beginning of the year-long AU chairmanship of Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, who is replacing Cyril Ramaphosa. Last week, Tshisekedi visited Cairo, pledged to resume the GERD negotiations under the AU’s umbrella immediately, and expressed confidence that peaceful talks would lead to consensual “outcomes”.

Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam is seen as it undergoes construction work on the Nile River in Guba Woreda, Benishangul Gumuz Region, Ethiopia, Sept. 26, 2019. (Reuters) Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat Ethiopia is rapidly advancing in building the Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile, in clear defiance of Egypt’s warnings that require a binding agreement on the rules of filling and operating the dam to avoid an expected shortfall in its water share. The construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) has reached 78.3 percent, a jump from 74 percent in June 2020, according to Ethiopia’s Ministry of Water, Energy and Irrigation. In a press briefing on Sunday, Minister of Water, Irrigation, and Energy Sileshi Bekele said the performance attained during the past six months is the fastest since the commencement of construction in 2011. Authorities started filling the reservoir on July 21, 2020. However, the completion of the first filling phase prior to reaching an agreement with Egypt and Sudan irked both countries. The dam is expected to hold 13.5 billion cubic meters of water in the upcoming rainy season, said Bekele, adding that of the total 13 power generating turbines, two will also start production during the same period. Cairo and Khartoum stress the need to reach a binding and comprehensive agreement that guarantees the rights and interests of the three countries, and includes a mechanism for settling disputes on filling and operation of the dam. They fear the potential negative impact of GERD on the flow of their annual share of the Nile’s 55.5 billion cubic meters of water. In television statements on Saturday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi stressed that his country is “fighting in the negotiations to protect the Egyptian people’s rights.” “Patience will bring the desired results,” he added.

News article:
The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam as it appears in a satellite image taken on July 20, 2020 (AFP) Cairo - Mohammed Abdo Hassanein Ethiopia stressed on Thursday its keenness to solve differences with Egypt over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), weeks after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on the operation and filling of the mega-dam. Ethiopian Ambassador to Cairo Markos Tekle held talks Thursday with Egypt’s Assistant Foreign Minister for African Affairs, Sherif Issa. He explained Ethiopia’s longstanding position on the GERD negotiations and said the country was willing to resolve the remaining differences among the parties “through talks.” Issa expressed Egypt’s commitment to hold talks on GERD, according to the Ethiopian Embassy in Cairo. The meeting has also deliberated on bilateral relations, and the two sides exchanged views on the implementation of initiatives aimed at strengthening the historic relationship between Cairo and Addis Ababa. Last month, the African Union-sponsored talks to reach a fair and balanced agreement between Cairo, Addis Ababa and Khartoum over the operation and filling of the mega-dam faltered. Egypt has called GERD an existential threat and worries that it will reduce the country’s share of Nile waters. Ethiopia says the 145-meter tall dam will be an engine of development and is vital to meet the power needs of its population. Sudan, in the middle, worries about the effects on its own dams, although it stands to benefit from access to cheap electricity. The Blue Nile, which meets the White Nile in the Sudanese capital, provides the great majority of the combined Nile’s flow through northern Sudan and Egypt to the Mediterranean.

News article:
Egypt is looking forward to the resumption of African Union-sponsored GERD negotiations under the new presidency of the Democratic Republic of Congo Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told his Finnish counterpart that “Egypt had hoped for the success of the African Union’s (AU) efforts in managing the file of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), but the negotiations did not yield something tangible and did not achieve the aspired results.” In a phone call on Sunday, Shoukry stressed to the Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto that “Egypt is looking forward to the resumption of negotiations” under the presidency of Félix Tshisekedi, the President of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the new head of the AU. The DRC assumed the presidency of the AU in 2021 in early February, replacing South Africa as chair. The months-long attempts by South Africa, in its capacity as the chair of the AU in 2020, at mediating a deal to end the deadlock in negotiations in the GERD dispute between Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia have failed due to Addis Ababa’s persistent intransigence. According to a statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry, Shoukry, moreover, stressed to Haavisto Egypt’s insistence on the need to reach a legally binding agreement in the GERD dispute between the three countries before Ethiopia initiates the second stage of filling the dam’s reservoir. Ethiopia has recently announced that it would start the second phase of filling the GERD’s 74 billion cubic metre reservoir during the rainy season of 2021 with 18.4 billion cubic metres of the Blue Nile’s waters, a year after completing the first filling with 4.9 billion cubic metres. Shoukry also stressed to his Finnish counterpart that the legally binding agreement could be reached through launching a serious negotiation path, taking into account the interests of the three concerned countries. Egypt and Sudan have been in talks with Ethiopia for years now to reach a legally binding agreement on the filling and operating of the $4.8 billion near-complete mega dam, which Ethiopia has started building on the Blue Nile since 2011. Ethiopia, however, has proposed a package of “non-binding guidelines” for the filling and operation of the GERD which were rejected by both downstream countries. “The Egyptian state has expressed its sincere political will to reach a fair and balanced agreement that achieves Ethiopia’s development goals and at the same time preserves Egypt’s rights and secures the two downstream countries from the risks and damages of the GERD,” Shoukry told Haavisto. Egypt’s 100 million-plus population relies on the Nile River for more than 95 percent of its renewable water resources. It fears the massive $4.8 billion hydropower near-complete project will significantly diminish its crucial water supply, which is already below scarcity level. Sudan, however, fears the GERD would put the operation of its Roseires dam, whose reservoir is located only 15km away from the Ethiopian dam, and the lives of 20 million Sudanese citizens at “a very high risk” if an agreement regulating its operation and filling is not reached. Ethiopia, on the other hand, hopes its 6,000-megawatt dam will make it Africa’s largest power exporter and will be a key to its development efforts. The two foreign ministers also discussed other pertinent issues in the Horn of Africa, according to the statement. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Cairo- Mohammed Abdu Hassanein Egypt has warned Ethiopia against filling the Renaissance Dam it is building on the Blue Nile before reaching a binding and legal agreement on the filling and operation process. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said Sunday that his country is ready to launch a new serious negotiation process that takes into account the interests of Cairo, Khartoum, and Addis Ababa. Ethiopia has been building the dam on the main tributary of the Nile since 2011, and its Ministry of Water, Irrigation, and Energy announced the completion of about 78 percent of the construction so far. Last week, it announced the dam is expected to hold 13.5 billion cubic meters of water in the upcoming rainy season. Authorities started filling the reservoir on July 21, 2020. However, the completion of the first filling phase prior to reaching an agreement with Egypt and Sudan irked both countries. Cairo has been seeking through intense diplomatic efforts to receive international support for its position against Addis Ababa’s. On Sunday, Shoukry received a phone call from Finnish Foreign Affairs Minister Pekka Haavisto, during which he affirmed that his country “had hoped for the success of the African Union (AU) efforts in resolving the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam’s (GERD) issue.” The AU-sponsored talks between Cairo, Addis Ababa, and Khartoum over the operation and filling of the mega-dam have faltered and were stalled in January, despite the intervention of international actors such as the United States and the European Union with observers. Shoukry expressed his country’s aspirations to resume talks under the AU's new chairmanship of Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi. “The Egyptian state has expressed its political determination to reach a fair and balanced agreement that achieves Ethiopia’s development goals while preserving Egypt’s rights and protecting the two downstream countries from the dam’s potential dangers,” a foreign ministry statement read. Addis Ababa refuses to legalize any agreement reached, which binds it to specific measures to alleviate the drought.

On Sunday, Shoukry received a phone call from Finnish Foreign Affairs Minister Pekka Haavisto, during which he affirmed that his country “had hoped for the success of the African Union (AU) efforts in resolving the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam’s (GERD) issue.” The AU-sponsored talks between Cairo, Addis Ababa, and Khartoum over the operation and filling of the mega-dam have faltered and were stalled in January, despite the intervention of international actors such as the United States and the European Union with observers. Shoukry expressed his country’s aspirations to resume talks under the AU's new chairmanship of Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi. “The Egyptian state has expressed its political determination to reach a fair and balanced agreement that achieves Ethiopia’s development goals while preserving Egypt’s rights and protecting the two downstream countries from the dam’s potential dangers,” a foreign ministry statement read. Addis Ababa refuses to legalize any agreement reached, which binds it to specific measures to alleviate the drought.

News article:
A view of Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam as it undergoes construction work on the river Nile in Guba Woreda, Benishangul Gumuz Region, Ethiopia. (Reuters) Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt said Wednesday it has endorsed a Sudanese proposal to internationalize arbitration in a years-long dispute with Ethiopia over a massive dam Addis Ababa is building on the Blue Nile. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said Cairo backs the formation of an “international quartet” including the US, the European Union, and the UN, along with the African Union to facilitate reaching a deal on the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopia Renaissance Dam. The dispute centers on how much water Ethiopia will release downstream if a multi-year drought occurs and how the three countries would settle any future disputes. Egypt and Sudan also call for a legally binding agreement on the dam’s filling and operation, while Ethiopia insists on guidelines. Shoukry said Egypt wants to develop the negotiating mechanism to reach a “legally binding agreement” at the earliest possible opportunity.” He announced Egypt’s position during a meeting Wednesday in Cairo with Alphonse Ntumba Luaba, the coordination of Democratic Republic of the Congo’s current leadership of the African Union. There were no immediate comments from Washington, Brussels, or the UN. Sudan has announced its proposal earlier this year after AU-led talks failed to achieve progress. Since then, Khartoum has become vocal against Ethiopia’s plans to start the second filling during the next rainy season. Prime Minister Abddalla Hamdok said earlier this month that the dam threatens at least 20 million Sudanese, roughly half the country’s population. Sudan wants Ethiopia to coordinate and share data on dam’s operation to avoid flooding and protect its own power-generating dams on the Blue Nile, the main tributary of the Nile River. The Blue Nile meets with the White Nile in central Sudan from where the Nile winds northward through Egypt and flows into the Mediterranean Sea. There was no comment from Ethiopia that had left a US-led attempt to mediate the dispute, alleging bias. The administration of former President Donald Trump last year sanctioned Ethiopia over the dam’s first filling before reaching a deal with Egypt and Sudan. On Friday, President Joe Biden's administration said it has de-linked the sanctions from the dam dispute. About 85 percent of the Nile's flow originates from Ethiopia. Officials hope the dam, now more than three-quarters complete, will reach full power-generating capacity in 2023, helping pull millions of its people out of poverty. Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous country with over 100 million people, called the dam an existential threat and worries that it would reduce its share of Nile waters. The country relies almost entirely on the Nile to supply water for agriculture and its people.

News article:
Khartoum - Ahmed Younis Sudan has toughened its rhetoric in the dispute over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) that Addis Ababa is constructing on the Blue Nile. It called for international mediators to resolve the dispute, including the United Nations, the African Union, the European Union and the United States. Sudanese Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Yasser Abbas urged parties to the negotiations on the dam to consider GERD a means for regional cooperation rather than political tension between Khartoum, Addis Ababa and Cairo. The unilateral second filling of the dam in July represents a “direct threat” to Sudan’s national security, SUNA quoted Abbas as saying on Monday. He hoped for a binding agreement between the three countries before the deadline. He said the filling of GERD threatens electricity generation from Sudan’s Merowe Dam and Roseires Dam, as well as the safety of the Roseires Dam and of 20 million Sudanese living downstream, he stressed. The Irrigation Ministry has taken several technical and diplomatic precautionary measures to face the possible filling of the mega dam, Abbas noted. He affirmed that his country is currently working on bolstering the AU mediation and include the UN, EU, and the US in the talks as mediators. Cairo and Khartoum stress the need to reach a binding and comprehensive agreement that guarantees the rights and interests of the three countries and includes a mechanism for settling disputes on the filling and operation of the dam. Ethiopia refused to sign a final agreement on the rules of filling and operating the dam earlier in 2020, under the mediation of the US and World Bank, prompting Khartoum to boycott the tripartite talks on January 10.

Cairo- Asharq Al-Awsat The United States Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, confirmed that the US is looking forward to deepening the economic partnership with Egypt, in a way that contributes to increasing US investments in the country that enjoys attractive climate and strong infrastructure. Mnuchin added, Wednesday, that they look forward to strengthening joint bilateral cooperation in combating money laundering operations that threaten world economies. This came during a meeting between Egyptian Finance Minister Mohamed Maait with Mnuchin and his accompanying delegation. Mnuchin praised the success of the economic reform program, which contributed to strengthening the structure of the Egyptian economy and containing the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Egyptian Ministry of Finance statement. Mnuchin emphasized that it is an important and unique experience that has given the Egyptian economy strength and rigidity in the face of internal and external crises and challenges, welcoming the Minister of Finance's keenness to transfer its expertise in the field of economic reform to neighboring countries. “We expect the global economic conditions to gradually improve, and the strong performance of the Egyptian economy will return after the provision of the coronavirus vaccine at the international level during the coming period,” he said. Mnuchin welcomed the flourishing bilateral trade and investment relations between the US and Egypt, noting that he looked forward to their recovering to pre-pandemic levels in the near future. He added that his country looks forward to strengthening economic cooperation between the two countries and attracting more American companies and investments to expand their economic activities in Egyptian markets, especially after the success of the economic reform program in improving the investment climate. For his part, Maait expressed the Egyptian government’s aspiration to maximize the investment activities of US companies in the country. He added that this would ensure a greater role for the US business sector in Egypt’s major development projects implemented in various parts of the country. Maait said: “We are ready to remove any obstacles to increase the investments of American companies in Egypt, especially that Egypt is qualified to be a regional center for the expansion of companies in the Middle East and Africa."

The ministry stated that Hanna attended the event upon the request of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi to convey his greetings to his Ghanaian counterpart. Egypt’s invitation to participate in the presidential inauguration ceremony reflects the deep-rooted friendship and cooperation between the Egyptian and Ghanaian peoples and presidents, as well as the appreciation of the significance of Egypt’s role at the continental and international levels, the statement read. The ministry also pointed out that this participation indicates a similar vision of both political leaderships regarding many African issues of mutual concern. These include achieving continental integration through the optimal benefit from African energies and resources and supporting efforts to launch the continental free trade area with the permanent headquarters in Accra. It is noteworthy that Egypt had played an active role during its African Union presidency to push forward the implementation of the trade area, being certain of the pivotal turning point such an agreement could bring about in line with the 2063 Agenda.

News article:
Egypt is seeking closer ties with Senegal in an attempt to counter Turkey's expansion in West Africa, reports Al-Monitor. Egypt is organising a visit to Senegal to discuss deepening agriculture and infrastructure projects in the context of "historical and fraternal ties between the African brothers," according to a member of Egypt's African Affairs Committee. Last year, Egypt was pushing for joint cooperation between the two countries in water and sanitation projects.

The delegation is expected to discuss mounting tensions between Ethiopia and Sudan over the disputed eastern border region of Al-Fashqa A high-level Sudanese delegation led by Sudan’s ruling Sovereign Council member Lieutenant General Shamseldin Kabashi arrived Egypt on Thursday to discuss bilateral ties and push means of joint cooperation. According to an official statement, Sudan’s Sovereign Council said Kabashi, who is accompanied by intelligence chief Lieutenant General Jamal Abdel Majeed and other officials, was received by Egypt’s foreign minister Sameh Shoukry. Earlier, state-owned Al-Arabiya said the delegation will head to Egypt to discuss mounting tensions between Ethiopia and Sudan over the disputed eastern border region of Al-Fashqa. Ethiopia and Sudan have been exchanging accusations over ownership rights of the agricultural area. The visit comes one day after Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan, the head of Sudan’s Sovereign Council, had visited Al-Qadarif, an area of which Al-Fashqa is part, to “emphasise the ability of the armed forces to protect the territory.” It also comes one day after a high-level delegation from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) concluded a one-day visit to Khartoum in an attempt to break the deadlock on the disputed Grand Renaissance Dam (GERD) after a recent collapse of African Union sponsored talks between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan this week. Sudan accused Ethiopia on Wednesday of a “dangerous and unjustified escalation” after an Ethiopian military aircraft crossed the disputed border area. The move “could have dangerous consequences and cause more tension in the border area,” Sudan’s foreign ministry said. Ethiopia warned Sudan on Tuesday that its patience was wearing out over Khartoum’s military build-up in the area despite efforts to resolve the rift diplomatically. The Ethiopian statement came as Sudan said armed Ethiopian “gangs” killed five women and a child in the area. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi received Thursday a Sudanese delegation in Cairo to discuss the recent border tensions between Khartoum and Addis Ababa, in addition to the latest regional developments, especially the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). Sisi held talks with members of the Transitional Sovereignty Council (TSC) Lt-General Shamsedeen Kabashi and his accompanying delegation, including Sudanese Minister of Culture and Information Fisal Mohammed Salih, Chief of General Intelligence Gamal Abdel Meguid, and Secretary-General of the council Mohamed Youssef. The talks tackled the latest developments concerning the mounting tensions between Ethiopia and Sudan over the disputed eastern border region of Al-Fashqa. Sisi said that Egypt is looking forward to continuing cooperation and coordination with Sudan in various areas, given the long-standing ties and common interests between the two countries. For his part, Kabashi stressed the distinguished and historical relations binding between Cairo and Khartoum, hailing Egypt's sustained support for Sudan during the current transitional period. The delegation also discussed with Sisi the GERD issue and the necessity of coordinating efforts and stances to achieve the interests of both countries. The visit comes after border tension between the two countries escalated during the conflict in the Tigray region. Ethiopian forces and militias attacked Sudanese forces inside their territory, killing three individuals and a high-ranking officer. The Sudanese army redeployed within its territory and regained control over more than 80 percent of the areas that had been witnessing an Ethiopian presence for many years. The negotiations to demarcate the border between Sudan and Ethiopia last December failed to reach an agreement. After arriving in Khartoum Thursday, Salih said the delegation briefed Sisi on the recent developments on the Sudanese-Ethiopian borders, pointing out that the visit is a part of an integrated program for visiting the neighboring and sisterly countries to brief them on the reality of the developments of the situations in the region. He also said it comes as part of the political and diplomatic efforts being exerted by the government to inform the leaders and the governments on Sudan’s position concerning the situations on the Sudanese-Ethiopian borders.

News article:
Cairo- Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt’s Nasr Automotive Manufacturing Company, of the Ministry of Public Enterprise, signed two agreements with China's Dongfeng Motor Corporation to reconstruct its factory to produce the first electric car in Egypt. Egypt’s Public Enterprise Minister Hisham Tawfik and the Chinese Ambassador to Cairo Liao Liqiang attended the online ceremony, which also included top officials from Nasr and Dongfeng. Speaking at the ceremony, Tawfiq stressed that the agreements mark the launch of Nasr towards the project of localizing the electric car industry in Egypt. Earlier, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi issued directives to relevant authorities on localizing and using national capabilities to manufacture electric vehicles. Tawfik explained that the project aims to preserve the environment by reducing dependence on fossil fuels and thermal emissions that have negative impacts on people and the economy. He explained that the agreements included a framework agreement for the production of the electric car in Nasr factories in cooperation with Dongfeng. Dongfeng is one of the four largest car manufacturers in China that produces about 3.5 million cars annually with its main partners in the auto industry worldwide, he mentioned. The two companies also signed an agreement to renew the Nasr factory with the latest technologies and production methods. The project comes within the framework of the automobile manufacturing strategy adopted by the political leadership, which takes into account all the associated factors, according to the Minister. Tawfik indicated that all relevant authorities and ministries are cooperating to ensure the success of this strategic project. They will deploy fast chargers in the streets and parking lots all over the country and prepare electricity networks to accommodate the expected increase in consumption. The authorities will also launch the necessary support policies which help encourage consumers to shift to new methods of transportation. He pointed out that the ministry relied on technical and commercial studies which led to choosing China’s Dongfeng, as well as the “E70” model. E70 electric vehicles will be used to reduce emissions and ensure successful sustainability while keeping pace with the increasing global trend of electric transport. In light of the President’s directives, Nasr Company will start its production of electric cars at a localization rate of 50 percent. At a later stage, the plan will include a research and development center, with the participation of national cadres and specialized Egyptian companies. An agreement is currently underway to establish a research and development center with Dongfeng and Egyptآ's Brightskies Technologies company. The Minister also reported that the project aims to produce 25,000 cars annually in one shift, and according to market studies, the volume of demand is expected to increase with the anticipated governmental support and incentives to double this amount.

News article:
Cairo- Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt’s Nasr Automotive Manufacturing Company, of the Ministry of Public Enterprise, signed two agreements with China's Dongfeng Motor Corporation to reconstruct its factory to produce the first electric car in Egypt. Egypt’s Public Enterprise Minister Hisham Tawfik and the Chinese Ambassador to Cairo Liao Liqiang attended the online ceremony, which also included top officials from Nasr and Dongfeng. Speaking at the ceremony, Tawfiq stressed that the agreements mark the launch of Nasr towards the project of localizing the electric car industry in Egypt. Earlier, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi issued directives to relevant authorities on localizing and using national capabilities to manufacture electric vehicles. Tawfik explained that the project aims to preserve the environment by reducing dependence on fossil fuels and thermal emissions that have negative impacts on people and the economy. He explained that the agreements included a framework agreement for the production of the electric car in Nasr factories in cooperation with Dongfeng. Dongfeng is one of the four largest car manufacturers in China that produces about 3.5 million cars annually with its main partners in the auto industry worldwide, he mentioned. The two companies also signed an agreement to renew the Nasr factory with the latest technologies and production methods. The project comes within the framework of the automobile manufacturing strategy adopted by the political leadership, which takes into account all the associated factors, according to the Minister. Tawfik indicated that all relevant authorities and ministries are cooperating to ensure the success of this strategic project. They will deploy fast chargers in the streets and parking lots all over the country and prepare electricity networks to accommodate the expected increase in consumption. The authorities will also launch the necessary support policies which help encourage consumers to shift to new methods of transportation. He pointed out that the ministry relied on technical and commercial studies which led to choosing China’s Dongfeng, as well as the “E70” model. E70 electric vehicles will be used to reduce emissions and ensure successful sustainability while keeping pace with the increasing global trend of electric transport. In light of the President’s directives, Nasr Company will start its production of electric cars at a localization rate of 50 percent. At a later stage, the plan will include a research and development center, with the participation of national cadres and specialized Egyptian companies. An agreement is currently underway to establish a research and development center with Dongfeng and Egyptآ's Brightskies Technologies company. The Minister also reported that the project aims to produce 25,000 cars annually in one shift, and according to market studies, the volume of demand is expected to increase with the anticipated governmental support and incentives to double this amount.

Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi listens to US Secretary of State John Kerry during their meeting at the Presidential palace in Cairo, Egypt, Wednesday, April 20, 2016. REUTERS/Amr Nabil/Pool Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat Egyptian President Abdul Fattah el-Sisi said Wednesday that the COVID-19 crisis has been a significant opportunity “to accelerate digitalization, and to improve our policies to become socially, economically, and environmentally more sustainable.” The president’s remarks were made in a televised speech he delivered on the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). "The year 2020 was full of challenges and negative repercussions posed by the coronavirus pandemic, to the extent that the post-COVID-19 world will be different than the one before," Sisi explained. However, the crisis "has availed important opportunities, notably to accelerate digitalization, and to improve our policies to become socially, economically, and environmentally more sustainable, which would contribute to achieving a comprehensive recovery as soon as possible," he stressed. Sisi said the crisis "highlights the role of the OECD, with its 60 years of experience in multilateral cooperation, in formulating policies that promote transparency and governance, accommodating the evolving trends and the needs of the global economy.” “It also highlights the OECD’s positive contribution to the formulation of the required global path and the sought-after solidarity to tackle this unprecedented crisis in the efforts to alleviate the burden shouldered by all countries regardless of their degree of development, in addition to guiding such joint efforts to a win-win situation," he added. The president has assured that despite the severity of the economic repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic, the Egyptian economy has demonstrated a resilience that helped sustain its positive growth rates. "This was possible in light of the structural economic reform program that Egypt adopted over the last few years, achieving significant successes in a short period,” he said. Sisi highlighted the positive impact of the program on development efforts and enhancing the government’s ability to effectively intervene when needed by introducing stimulus packages for key economic sectors, as well as providing support for the most vulnerable segments of the society. The president expressed Egypt's deep appreciation for the prominent role the OECD plays at the bilateral level with Egypt. He added that the organization "has significantly contributed to the development of standards and the formulation of economic and development policies capable of achieving the slogan agreed upon by its member states: Better Policies for Better Life."

Egypt is planning to establish an industrial zone in Sudan to facilitate the set up of joint projects. The strategy will be implemented by the private sector to boost the economic integration between the two sides, Egypt’s Minister of Trade and Industry Niveen Gamea said on Thursday. Gamea made the announcement during an extended discussion in Khartoum with the Sudanese Minister of Trade and Industry Abbas Madany and a number of Sudanese officials, in the attendance of Egypt’s Ambassador to Sudan Hossam Eissa. The session was held on the sidelines of Gamea’s visit to Sudan to represent Egypt in the 38th round of the Khartoum International Expo. Egypt is the expo’s guest of honour in its current round. Gamea called on Sudan to hold the joint trade committee in Cairo to discuss the technical aspects regarding the trade flow between the two countries, noting that trade exchange between Egypt and Sudan recorded $862 million in 2020. She added that Egypt’s exports to Sudan amounted to $496 million, while Egypt’s imports from Sudan recorded $366 billion in 2020. Chemicals, processed products, machines, foodstuffs, textiles, transport means, livestock, and agricultural products are the main traded goods between the two countries, according to Gamea. The minister pointed out to the possibility of boosting industrial cooperation between the two sides in pharmaceutical industries and increasing Egyptian pharmaceutical exports to Sudan. “Egypt is willing to extend its economic support to brotherly Sudan in the ongoing transitional phase. Egypt’s business community is also keen on establishing partnerships with the country in line with Sudan’s agenda for industrial and infrastructure projects it targets to establish,” said Gamea. Gamea discussed with the Sudanese minister of transport and infrastructure the possibility of participating in the Sudanese capital triangle zone improvement project that includes establishing bridges, renewing sanitation networks and rerouting roads through partnering with Egypt’s private sector. Madany said that Sudan is eager to enhance economic cooperation prospects with Egypt, especially in the industrial sector, as Sudan targets producing high value-added products by establishing private sector partnerships between the two countries.

El-Sisi also opened projects for dairy and livestock products in Fayoum and Nubaria and projects for producing marble and granite in South Sinai’s Ras Sedr city and Ain Sokhna city in Suez Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi inaugurated on Saturday the El-Fayrouz fish farming project in the northeastern Port Said city among other development projects nationwide. The Port Said project is founded over 15,886 feddans and includes two fishing lakes on an area of 9,762 feddans, Mostafa Amin Ali, the general director of the National Service Projects Authority said. The new fish farming project has 5,908 tanks with an annual production capacity estimated at 13,000 tons. The project includes a fish processing factory, an ice production factory, a laboratory for tests and research, a number of water plants and a network of canals and drains. According to Presidential Spokesman Bassam Radi, the project aims at reducing the gap between production and consumption, achieving self-sufficiency, and limiting fish imports. The project is also meant to increase fish exports to Arab and European countries, Radi said, adding that it will contribute to securing foreign currency and supporting the national economy. It is also set to provide 10,000 direct and indirect job opportunities, he noted. In his speech during the inauguration ceremony, El-Sisi said the project was implemented at a high cost, having met comprehensive industrial standards. He said that many national mega-projects were implemented, including in the fields of agriculture, land reclamation and fish farming, noting that the state is developing Lake Manzala near Port Said. “In order for the Lake (Manzala), that is founded on 250,000 feddans, to produce 70,000 or 80,000 tons of fish or more, what we have done should be followed by full control on procedures in the lake,” the president said. El-Sisi also opened a fish farming project at Deeba Triangle in west Port Said via video-conference. According to the head of the National Company for Fish Resources Hamdy Badeen, the Deeba Triangle project is implemented on a total area of 204 feddans. It consists of 72 tanks with an annual production capacity estimated at 250 tons. Ongoing projects The ceremony witnessed the inauguration of other projects via video-conference, including projects for dairy and livestock products in Fayoum and Nubaria and projects for producing marble and granite in South Sinai’s Ras Sedr city and Ain Sokhna city in Suez. El-Sisi said overpopulation was hampering development efforts. “I want to improve the living conditions of all citizens… but population growth is not giving us the chance,” the president added. He referred to a project to develop 1,500 villages, stating that it will provide sanitation services and road networks, drinking water systems, governmental institutions, and other services. He noted that the project will contribute to securing job opportunities for local contractors. The project will significantly develop the countryside within three years, the president added. Railways Egypt is upgrading 10,000 kilometres of railway lines across the country, El-Sisi said, adding that by the end of the year, all old locomotives and railcars will have been replaced. The president revealed plans to establish a new railway line between the northern 6 October city in Giza to Upper Egypt’s Aswan in the south, saying that passengers will be able to travel between the two cities in four hours. He noted that the state rejected foreign bids to implement a 450-kilometre railway line between Ain Sokhna and Alamein valued at $19.5 billion and $10 billion, saying that a 2,000-kilometre railway line is being implemented with a total cost of EGP 350 billion (about $22 billion). “The railway lines we are implementing are a big goal… We are working for our people in Egypt,” El-Sisi said. The president reiterated that overpopulation remains an obstacle to the state’s development efforts, because population grows faster than the state’s resources. Development efforts Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly reviewed a number of state projects being implemented as part of Egypt’s 2030 strategy. The premier said the state has been implementing 31,000 projects to improve people's lives in rural and urban areas. The projects have been implemented with investments valued at over EGP 5.8 trillion, Madbouly said, noting that many of these projects were already implemented and the rest will be finished within three years. Madbouly said the state has been constructing 30 new cities with a total investment of EGP 700 billion. The cities are expected to accommodate around 30 million people, he noted, adding that construction is planned to finish in four years. Madbouly said Egypt has a large number of dry ports, adding that the total investment in these ports amounts to EGP 50 billion. “The goal of developing ports is for Egypt to become a hub for international trade,” Madbouly said. In electricity, the premier said Egypt has invested over EGP 500 billion, adding that the country now has a surplus in power and is capable of exporting it to neighbouring countries. The state has been working to implement 25 governmental, private and non-profit private universities, valued at EGP 150 billion, Madbouly said. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
New efforts are being made to boost economic and trade relations between Egypt and Sudan Egyptian Minister of Trade and Industry Nevine Gamea met with her Sudanese counterparts to mull over increasing bilateral trade cooperation when she attended the Khartoum International Fair from 21 to 28 January in the Sudanese capital. Egypt was the guest of honour at the fair, and Gamea’s meetings were part of Egypt’s determination to open a new page in its trade relations with Sudan. Topping the agenda at the meetings was renewing the licence for the Egyptian Trade Centre in Sudan, this helping to make Egyptian goods available to Sudanese consumers at a lower cost and in a shorter time. Gamea met with Madani Abbas Madani, Sudan’s minister of industry and trade, and Hashim Mohamed bin Auf, minister of infrastructure and transport, to discuss opportunities for economic cooperation and developments in the commercial, industrial, and transport sectors. One of the main challenges facing Egyptian exporters and hindering the flow of trade was the sometimes poor quality of the road network in Sudan, a member of the Egyptian-Sudanese Business Council told Al-Ahram Weekly. He said that the Egyptian government’s intention to establish an integrated transportation company to establish regular transport lines with Sudan would boost bilateral trade, since Egyptian exporters have great potential in Sudanese markets if they can overcome transport problems. According to Gamea, trade between Egypt and Sudan last year reached $862 million, $496 million of which were Egyptian exports to Sudan and $366 million were imports. The most important items traded between the two countries are chemicals, manufactured products, machinery and equipment, food products, textiles, transportation materials, livestock, and agricultural products. Trade with Sudan is already on the rise. In 2019, trade exchanges between Egypt and Sudan recorded around $675 million, up from around $611 million in 2018, an increase of 10.4 per cent. Egyptian exports to Sudan made up 1.5 per cent of total Egyptian exports in 2019, while imports from Sudan were 5.1 per cent of total Sudanese exports. Plastic products were prominent on Egypt’s export list to Sudan in 2019. Exports worth around $81 million were recorded in 2019, up from around $77 million in 2018. Egypt’s exports to Sudan represent about four per cent of its total plastic exports. Iron and steel come second on the list of Egypt’s exports to Sudan, with fertilisers occupying third place followed by glass, utensils, and pharmaceutical products. Constituting almost 98 per cent of Sudan’s exports to Egypt in 2019 were seeds and fruit, livestock, cotton, and meat. In August 2020, Egyptian Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouli travelled to Sudan to discuss with Sudanese counterpart Abdalla Hamdok the transport challenges facing Egyptian exporters to Sudan. They agreed on the need to restructure the Nile Valley Authority for Riverine Navigation (NVARN) to increase its efficiency and upgrade its fleet. NVARN is an Egyptian-Sudanese organisation that transports passengers as well as goods. It was established in 1975 as the only international transporter working on Lake Nasser. Egypt and Sudan have also discussed a project to link the railways of the two countries to increase economic and trade cooperation, develop maritime navigation, and update the cooperation agreement on land transport between Cairo and Khartoum. Madbouli’s visit to Sudan resulted in an agreement to remove obstacles hindering the flow of trade, especially concerning roads leading to land ports. Putting this deal into effect will be a crucial step in achieving economic integration between Egypt and Sudan. Some 21 Egyptian companies participated in this month’s Khartoum International Fair, regarding it as an opportunity to increase their exports to Sudan. The companies specialised in the commercial and service sectors as well as in engineering, food, construction, chemicals, crops, and leather. Ahmed Gaber, a member of the Egyptian-Sudanese Business Council, said that despite the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA) agreements to which Egypt and Sudan are signatories, there are still 54 Egyptian products on which customs are imposed when entering Sudan, constituting a hindrance to Egyptian exports. Regulations related to the Covid-19 currently prevent vehicle traffic across the Egyptian-Sudanese border. Exporters offload their cargoes on the border, from where they are transported by the other country’s vehicles. A problem facing Sudanese importers is a shortage of foreign currency, which affects their ability to import Egyptian products, Gaber said. Were the Egyptian and Sudanese central banks to reach an agreement on credit arrangements, Egyptian exports could win the lion’s share of Sudan’s imports, estimated at $7 billion annually. The establishment of an Egyptian industrial zone in Sudan was another topic of discussion at the meetings between Gamea and her Sudanese counterparts. A feasibility study of the zone has been completed and is awaiting input from the Sudanese side, she said. The industrial zone is expected to attract Egyptian investments into Sudan, Gamea said. According to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), Sudan’s investments in Egypt were $1.9 million in 2018-19, up from $300,000 in 2017-18, an increase of 53.3 per cent. These investments are in the fields of industry, finance, services, agriculture, construction, tourism, and communications. Egypt established 229 projects in Sudan between 2000 and 2013, representing a total investment of $10.8 billion. The projects focused on the industrial, agricultural, and service sectors. The moves to boost prospects for bilateral cooperation with Sudan are part of Egypt’s desire to bolster cooperation with the African countries in the infrastructure, electricity, agricultural, industrial, and irrigation sectors. Sudan is Egypt’s southern gateway to Africa, making it even more necessary for the two countries to cooperate fully in boosting their respective roles on the African continent. *A version of this article appears in print in the 28 January, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly.

According to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), Sudan’s investments in Egypt were $1.9 million in 2018-19, up from $300,000 in 2017-18, an increase of 53.3 per cent. These investments are in the fields of industry, finance, services, agriculture, construction, tourism, and communications. Egypt established 229 projects in Sudan between 2000 and 2013, representing a total investment of $10.8 billion. The projects focused on the industrial, agricultural, and service sectors. The moves to boost prospects for bilateral cooperation with Sudan are part of Egypt’s desire to bolster cooperation with the African countries in the infrastructure, electricity, agricultural, industrial, and irrigation sectors. Sudan is Egypt’s southern gateway to Africa, making it even more necessary for the two countries to cooperate fully in boosting their respective roles on the African continent. *A version of this article appears in print in the 28 January, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly.

New efforts are being made to boost economic and trade relations between Egypt and Sudan Egyptian Minister of Trade and Industry Nevine Gamea met with her Sudanese counterparts to mull over increasing bilateral trade cooperation when she attended the Khartoum International Fair from 21 to 28 January in the Sudanese capital. Egypt was the guest of honour at the fair, and Gamea’s meetings were part of Egypt’s determination to open a new page in its trade relations with Sudan. Topping the agenda at the meetings was renewing the licence for the Egyptian Trade Centre in Sudan, this helping to make Egyptian goods available to Sudanese consumers at a lower cost and in a shorter time. Gamea met with Madani Abbas Madani, Sudan’s minister of industry and trade, and Hashim Mohamed bin Auf, minister of infrastructure and transport, to discuss opportunities for economic cooperation and developments in the commercial, industrial, and transport sectors. One of the main challenges facing Egyptian exporters and hindering the flow of trade was the sometimes poor quality of the road network in Sudan, a member of the Egyptian-Sudanese Business Council told Al-Ahram Weekly. He said that the Egyptian government’s intention to establish an integrated transportation company to establish regular transport lines with Sudan would boost bilateral trade, since Egyptian exporters have great potential in Sudanese markets if they can overcome transport problems. According to Gamea, trade between Egypt and Sudan last year reached $862 million, $496 million of which were Egyptian exports to Sudan and $366 million were imports. The most important items traded between the two countries are chemicals, manufactured products, machinery and equipment, food products, textiles, transportation materials, livestock, and agricultural products. Trade with Sudan is already on the rise. In 2019, trade exchanges between Egypt and Sudan recorded around $675 million, up from around $611 million in 2018, an increase of 10.4 per cent. Egyptian exports to Sudan made up 1.5 per cent of total Egyptian exports in 2019, while imports from Sudan were 5.1 per cent of total Sudanese exports. Plastic products were prominent on Egypt’s export list to Sudan in 2019. Exports worth around $81 million were recorded in 2019, up from around $77 million in 2018. Egypt’s exports to Sudan represent about four per cent of its total plastic exports. Iron and steel come second on the list of Egypt’s exports to Sudan, with fertilisers occupying third place followed by glass, utensils, and pharmaceutical products. Constituting almost 98 per cent of Sudan’s exports to Egypt in 2019 were seeds and fruit, livestock, cotton, and meat. In August 2020, Egyptian Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouli travelled to Sudan to discuss with Sudanese counterpart Abdalla Hamdok the transport challenges facing Egyptian exporters to Sudan. They agreed on the need to restructure the Nile Valley Authority for Riverine Navigation (NVARN) to increase its efficiency and upgrade its fleet. NVARN is an Egyptian-Sudanese organisation that transports passengers as well as goods. It was established in 1975 as the only international transporter working on Lake Nasser. Egypt and Sudan have also discussed a project to link the railways of the two countries to increase economic and trade cooperation, develop maritime navigation, and update the cooperation agreement on land transport between Cairo and Khartoum. Madbouli’s visit to Sudan resulted in an agreement to remove obstacles hindering the flow of trade, especially concerning roads leading to land ports. Putting this deal into effect will be a crucial step in achieving economic integration between Egypt and Sudan. Some 21 Egyptian companies participated in this month’s Khartoum International Fair, regarding it as an opportunity to increase their exports to Sudan. The companies specialised in the commercial and service sectors as well as in engineering, food, construction, chemicals, crops, and leather. Ahmed Gaber, a member of the Egyptian-Sudanese Business Council, said that despite the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA) agreements to which Egypt and Sudan are signatories, there are still 54 Egyptian products on which customs are imposed when entering Sudan, constituting a hindrance to Egyptian exports. Regulations related to the Covid-19 currently prevent vehicle traffic across the Egyptian-Sudanese border. Exporters offload their cargoes on the border, from where they are transported by the other country’s vehicles. A problem facing Sudanese importers is a shortage of foreign currency, which affects their ability to import Egyptian products, Gaber said. Were the Egyptian and Sudanese central banks to reach an agreement on credit arrangements, Egyptian exports could win the lion’s share of Sudan’s imports, estimated at $7 billion annually. The establishment of an Egyptian industrial zone in Sudan was another topic of discussion at the meetings between Gamea and her Sudanese counterparts. A feasibility study of the zone has been completed and is awaiting input from the Sudanese side, she said. The industrial zone is expected to attract Egyptian investments into Sudan, Gamea said. According to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), Sudan’s investments in Egypt were $1.9 million in 2018-19, up from $300,000 in 2017-18, an increase of 53.3 per cent. These investments are in the fields of industry, finance, services, agriculture, construction, tourism, and communications. Egypt established 229 projects in Sudan between 2000 and 2013, representing a total investment of $10.8 billion. The projects focused on the industrial, agricultural, and service sectors.

News article:
Egypt’s government has launched the second phase of initiative supporting export companies, announcing that the registration will open as of 7 February through until the end of the month. Minister of Finance, Mohamed Maait said on Sunday that the initiative came in implementation of President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi's directives to back the sector, adding that it aims at disbursing the export companies' arrears from the Export Development Fund (EDF) before the end of the current FY2020/2021 (ending in June). The initiative’s second phase will be executed with the same conditions of the first phase, according to Maait. He added that this initiative contributes in providing cash liquidity that enables export companies to meet their financial obligations, keep their labour force and boost the competitiveness of Egyptian products in international markets, especially with the severe impacts that hit the sector due to the COVID-19 crisis. In September, Egypt’s government launched the first phase of the initiative that targeted instant and cash repayment of the entirety of export companies’ arrears from the EDF before the end of 2020 at a repay acceleration discount of 15 percent. 1069 export companies benefitted from the first phase, with total disbursements of EGP 13.5 billion, according to the minister. The initiative is implemented in collaboration with the banking system, as the finance ministry deposits a guarantee at the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) to allow for the payment of the arrears for the companies that are willing to pay their entire dues, according to minister. This will be allowed for the companies that will subscribe to the initiative before the end of February, end of April and the end of June, said Maait. He added that the finance ministry will repay these sums and their proceeds to the banks that contributed to the initiative over three years. The minister revealed that the government disbursed EGP 21 billion over a year in order to support the exports sector through six initiatives. 2500 export companies benefitted from the other five initiatives with a total of EGP 5.6 billion disbursed for the exports during FY2019/2020 as well as EGP 2.4 billion disbursed from July to November 2020. The cabinet has approved five initiatives since October 2019 that aimed to settle the exporters’ arrears through June 2019. The initiatives included the repayment of small investors with a maximum of EGP 5 million, the repayment of 30 percent of the whole arrears to the exporters, holding a set-off between the exporters’ arrears and the payable tax and custom obligations on them, the repayment of the total arrear sums over four to five years while expanding their investments in return, in addition to the land allocation initiative.

News article:
The first phase of a national project aimed at improving living conditions and creating job opportunities for more than 5,000 poor villages nationwide was launched last week. President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi who spearheaded the project instructed the government to facilitate improving 1,500 villages in its first phase. This phase of the plan, entitled the National Programme for the Development of Egyptian Villages, will last until the end of the year and will target improving the quality of life in villages where 57 per cent of Egypt’s population resides. The rate of poverty in these villages exceeds 55 per cent. The rates of illiteracy and the percentage of households where women are the bread-winners are higher than in other villages and urban areas. Most of these villages lack potable water, proper sanitation, natural gas networks, and paved roads. The villages included in the first phase are in Assiut, Sohag, Beheira, Qena, Minya, Aswan, Luxor, Menoufiya, Fayoum, Beni Sweif, Giza, Al-Wadi Al-Gedid, Qalioubiya, Daqahliya, Alexandria, Gharbiya, Sharqiya, Ismailia, Damietta, and Kafr Al-Sheikh governorates. “There is a dire need to rally the efforts of the state bodies together with civil society organisations and individuals to successfully implement this huge project,” said Presidential Spokesperson Bassam Radi. Radi said the project is designed to complement Egypt’s “Decent Life” programme to improve rural communities by ensuring better living conditions, reducing poverty, upgrading infrastructure and improving public services, especially educational, housing, healthcare, power, sanitation, drinking water, and natural gas services. “The programme also focuses on supporting small and medium enterprises [SMEs] in these villages, improving healthcare units, upgrading the efficiency of irrigation networks, enhancing agricultural and veterinary services and establishing advanced dairy collection centres,” Radi pointed out. He said the plan will include the relocation of public service offices in governorates and villages, and connecting them electronically to the related ministries in their new headquarters in the New Administrative Capital. This is not the first time the country’s poorest villages have been focused on, according to Hani Younis, the spokesman of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Construction. In 2019, there was a presidential initiative to develop 143 villages in 11 governorates; civil society participated in improving 37 of them in the governorates of Minya, Assiut, Sohag, and Qena. The rate of internal migration from the countryside to the cities, according to Younis, has reached 55 per cent. Developing Egyptian villages will contribute to the reduction of migration to the cities. “The prime minister announced that Egyptian, not foreign, companies will be tasked with providing the resources needed for the project,” Younis said. Younis said he believed the scheme would provide several job opportunities for youth. Factories would cooperate with the government to implement this national project, thus revitalising the country’s economy.

News article:
Egypt is seeking to strengthen cooperation ties with Iraq via supporting development efforts in the country as part of an oil-for-reconstruction agreement reached between Cairo and Baghdad, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly told Iraq’s Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein during their meeting in the Egyptian capital on Monday. “There are clear and continuous mandates by President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi to the government to strengthen cooperation ties with brotherly Iraq, and to do whatever it takes to support development efforts on Iraq’s land, especially after an agreement was reached on activating the oil-for-reconstruction mechanism,” Madbouly stressed to the Hussein, according to a cabinet statement. The Egyptian PM and Iraqi foreign minister met yesterday on the sideline of the emergency meeting of Arab foreign ministers at the Arab League (AL) in Cairo, which discussed the Palestinian cause and other regional issues. Madbouly said he is following up on the implementation of the cooperation deals agreed upon between the two countries during the latest meetings of the Egyptian-Iraqi High committee, as well as the tripartite meetings between Egypt, Iraq, and Jordan. During a meeting of the Egyptian-Iraqi High Committee in Baghdad in October, Cairo and Baghdad reached an initial agreement to establish an oil-for-reconstruction mechanism, under which Egyptian companies are to implement construction projects in Iraq in return for Iraq providing Egypt with certain quantities of oil. With the aim of boosting bilateral cooperation, both countries also signed 15 agreements and memoranda of understanding in various fields, including oil, transport, roads, housing, construction, trade, industry, and others. Meanwhile, Egypt, Iraq, and Jordan are targeting cementing cooperation ties in different fields, foremost of which are the oil pipeline power linkages ventures, as agreed during the latest tripartite summits between the three countries, the latest of which was held in Cairo in December. Hussein expressed to Madbouly his country’s hope “to build on the outcomes of the High Committee meetings hosted in Baghdad, and to maximise the benefit from the oil-for-reconstruction mechanism.” The Iraqi foreign minister said he is following up with his counterparts in Egypt and Jordan on other trilateral cooperation files. Earlier on Monday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry met with Hussein and their Jordanian counterpart in a tripartite meeting also on the sidelines of the emergency meeting to coordinate positions on issues of mutual concern and the Palestinian cause.

News article:
The agenda can mobilise up to €30 billion in private and public investments in the region over the next decade The European Commission and the high representative announced the adoption of a new agenda for the Mediterranean region, including Egypt, the European delegation in Egypt said on Wednesday. The European Union (EU) in Brussels said the agenda is meant to boost the strategic partnership between the EU and the Mediterranean, according to the EU statement. “The new agenda is based on the conviction that by working together and in a spirit of partnership, common challenges can be turned into opportunities, in the mutual interest of the EU and its Southern Neighbours,” said the EU. The agenda includes an economic and investment plan that targets boosting the long-term socio-economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in the southern neighbourhood, read the statement. Under the new EU's Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), up to €7 billion for the period 2021 to 2027 will be allocated to its implementation, which can mobilise around €30 billion in private and public investments in the region over the next decade. “This communication sends a crucial message about the importance we attach to our Southern Neighbourhood. A strengthened Mediterranean partnership remains a strategic imperative for the European Union. 25 years after the Barcelona Declaration and 10 years after the Arab Spring, challenges in the Mediterranean – many of which resulting from global trends – remain daunting,”, said EU High Representative and Vice-President Josep Borrell. “To address these challenges, we need to renew our mutual efforts and act closely together as partners, in the interest of all of us. This is what this new agenda is all about. We are determined to work together with our Southern Partners on a new agenda that will focus on people, especially women and youth, and help them meet their hopes for the future, enjoy their rights and build a peaceful, secure, more democratic, greener, prosperous and inclusive Southern Neighbourhood,” Borrell explained. The Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Olivér Várhelyi said that the renewed partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood presents a new beginning in EU’s relations with its southern partners. “Based on common interests and common challenges, developed together with our neighbours... Europe wants to contribute directly to a long-term vision of prosperity and stability of the region, especially in the social and economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. In close dialogue with our partners, we have identified a number of priority sectors, from creating growth and jobs, investing in human capital, and good governance. We consider migration to be a common challenge, where we are ready to work to fight irregular migration and smugglers together with our partners as it is a risk for all of us. We will work together to bring real change on the ground for the benefit of both our neighbours and Europe,” according to Várhelyi. The EU said that the new agenda focuses on five policy areas, including human development, good governance and the rule of law, resilience, prosperity, and digital transition. It also includes providing support to countries to address security challenges and find solutions to ongoing conflicts, in addition to addressing the challenges of forced displacement and irregular migration, and facilitating safe and legal pathways for migration and mobility. The agenda concentrates on green transition as well as introducing an economic investment plan for the Southern Neighbours to ensure the quality of life for people in the region improves and economic recovery is realised.

The agenda can mobilise up to €30 billion in private and public investments in the region over the next decade The European Commission and the high representative announced the adoption of a new agenda for the Mediterranean region, including Egypt, the European delegation in Egypt said on Wednesday. The European Union (EU) in Brussels said the agenda is meant to boost the strategic partnership between the EU and the Mediterranean, according to the EU statement. “The new agenda is based on the conviction that by working together and in a spirit of partnership, common challenges can be turned into opportunities, in the mutual interest of the EU and its Southern Neighbours,” said the EU. The agenda includes an economic and investment plan that targets boosting the long-term socio-economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in the southern neighbourhood, read the statement. Under the new EU's Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), up to €7 billion for the period 2021 to 2027 will be allocated to its implementation, which can mobilise around €30 billion in private and public investments in the region over the next decade. “This communication sends a crucial message about the importance we attach to our Southern Neighbourhood. A strengthened Mediterranean partnership remains a strategic imperative for the European Union. 25 years after the Barcelona Declaration and 10 years after the Arab Spring, challenges in the Mediterranean – many of which resulting from global trends – remain daunting,”, said EU High Representative and Vice-President Josep Borrell. “To address these challenges, we need to renew our mutual efforts and act closely together as partners, in the interest of all of us. This is what this new agenda is all about. We are determined to work together with our Southern Partners on a new agenda that will focus on people, especially women and youth, and help them meet their hopes for the future, enjoy their rights and build a peaceful, secure, more democratic, greener, prosperous and inclusive Southern Neighbourhood,” Borrell explained. The Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Olivér Várhelyi said that the renewed partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood presents a new beginning in EU’s relations with its southern partners. “Based on common interests and common challenges, developed together with our neighbours... Europe wants to contribute directly to a long-term vision of prosperity and stability of the region, especially in the social and economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. In close dialogue with our partners, we have identified a number of priority sectors, from creating growth and jobs, investing in human capital, and good governance. We consider migration to be a common challenge, where we are ready to work to fight irregular migration and smugglers together with our partners as it is a risk for all of us. We will work together to bring real change on the ground for the benefit of both our neighbours and Europe,” according to Várhelyi. The EU said that the new agenda focuses on five policy areas, including human development, good governance and the rule of law, resilience, prosperity, and digital transition. It also includes providing support to countries to address security challenges and find solutions to ongoing conflicts, in addition to addressing the challenges of forced displacement and irregular migration, and facilitating safe and legal pathways for migration and mobility. The agenda concentrates on green transition as well as introducing an economic investment plan for the Southern Neighbours to ensure the quality of life for people in the region improves and economic recovery is realised.

AMMAN — Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Bisher Al Khasawneh on Thursday conveyed a verbal message from His Majesty King Abdullah to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi. The message reaffirmed “the depth of the brotherly relations” between the two countries, as well as highlighted the views on issues of mutual interests and in service of Arab issues, foremost of which is the Palestinian cause, the Jordan News Agency, Petra, reported.

They also emphasised the necessity of bolstering the trilateral cooperation brought forth from the outcomes of the Amman-hosted tripartite summit between His Majesty King Abdullah, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi and Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al Kadhimi. Talks also went over expanding the trilateral cooperation to include more Arab nations for the best interests of these countries and their peoples. Khasawneh also stressed the importance of Sisi’s recent visit to Amman, which took place last month, highlighting the need of building on the two leaderships’ mutual visits towards achieving more cooperation and integration. The Jordanian-Egyptian relations have “set an example” in Arab “brotherly ties” in all fields, he said, highlighting the two leaderships’ efforts in this arena.

The two officials discussed bilateral cooperation in the fields of energy and combating terrorism and extremist ideology Cairo is looking forward to increasing the ongoing coordination with Jordan at the bilateral level, and within the framework of the two countries’ trilateral cooperation mechanism with Iraq, President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi told Jordanian Prime Minister Bisher Al-Khasawneh on Thursday. El-Sisi received PM Al-Khasawneh, who is on an official visit to the Egyptian capital. Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly and head of Egypt's General Intelligence Service Abbas Kamel attended the meeting, according to a statement by presidential spokesperson Bassam Rady. During the meeting, El-Sisi described Egypt-Jordan relations as historical and close, the statement added. The Jordanian prime minister expressed his country's keenness to continue to coordinate with Egypt on different fronts as well as promote bilateral cooperation in a way that contributes to confronting the joint challenges facing the Arab world. He added that Egypt is playing a "pivotal" role in the region, the statement added. The meeting dealt with bilateral cooperation in the fields of energy, combating terrorism and extremist ideology, bolstering economic ties and enhancing trade. The mechanisms of implementing the ventures agreed upon within the framework of the trilateral cooperation between Egypt, Jordan and Iraq were also tackled during the meeting, which followed a meeting between El-Sisi and Iraq's Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein in Cairo a day prior. Egypt, Jordan and Iraq have been pushing for fostering trilateral cooperation in terms of the economy, trade, energy and investment to establish strategic integration between Egypt, Jordan and Iraq. The three leaders held three trilateral summits to push forward their efforts, the latest of which was held in the Jordanian capital Amman in August 2020. A fourth summit is set to be held soon to follow up on the previous steps. The meeting also touched upon the latest developments in the regional situations as both countries' officials agreed to maintain coordination to affirm the principle of a comprehensive political settlement for various disputes and issues in the region. They also discussed the developments of the peace process in the Middle East in light of the results of the last ministerial meeting of the Arab League on Monday. The statement added that the officials agreed to work on intensifying international efforts to settle the Palestinian crisis based on international legitimacy resolutions to resume peace negotiations. Cairo has been in talks with several Western parties to push forward the frozen Israeli-Palestinian peace process. In February 2020, Egypt, along with Jordan, France, and Germany, formed the quartet committee to revive the halted negotiations. The committee has so far held four meetings, the latest of which was hosted by Cairo earlier this month, where the foreign ministers of the four countries forged 11 provisions detailed in a joint statement outlining the endeavours to revive the peace process.

Madbouly said the ongoing development, part of a greater development scheme for historic Cairo, is expected to restore the 150-year-old square to its former glory Egypt's Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly and his Jordanian counterpart, Bishr Al-Khasawneh, made a visit to Downtown Cairo to inspect the ongoing development works at Tahrir square. Madbouly explained to Al-Khasawneh details surrounding the project, which will extend to sites in and around the square like Omar Makram Mosque, the Mogamma government building, the Egyptian Museum, the historic building that formerly housed the foreign ministry, and the newly established Tahrir parking garage. Madbouly said the ongoing development, part of a greater development scheme for historic Cairo, is expected to restore the 150-year-old square to its former glory, adding that it will become a civilised facade symbolising the spirit of ongoing development in the old capital. The inspection came after a joint meeting between the prime ministers of the two countries, in the presence of a number of ministers, to discuss ways to help strengthen relations between Egypt and Jordan to encourage joint industrialisation and commercial exchange. Madbouly said the project will involve painting the facades of buildings, planting trees to create green spaces, and decorating the entire square with pure light LEDs to create a festive atmosphere. The square is already home to a 17-metre obelisk that weighs 90 tons, dating back to the reign of the ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses II, and four ram-headed sphinx statues from Luxor’s Karnak Temple, turning it into an open-air museum commemorating Egyptian history and celebrating pharaonic heritage. The project is funded by the Ministry of Housing, Utilities, and Urban Communities in coordination with Cairo and the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities as part of the plan to showcase Egypt’s civilisation.

CAIRO: Czech industrial real estate developer CTP Invest plans to invest $600 million in Egypt within the next five years. During a meeting with Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, the company’s founder and CEO Remon Vos said the investment would consist in the establishment of two business complexes in Cairo. The parks would be situated on plots of 2 million square meters each and would help create up to 14,000 direct new jobs.

The visit is expected to further strengthen and diversify Pakistan’s bilateral ties with Egypt Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi is set to start a three-day visit to Egypt on Tuesday upon an invitation by his Egyptian counterpart, Sameh Shoukry. According to an official statement by the Pakistani foreign ministry on Monday, the visit comes on the back of the meetings held between Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi. Both leaders met on the sidelines of the summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Mecca in 2019 and then on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly in New York in the same year. In 2020, PM Khan had a telephone conversation with President El-Sisi regarding the Global Initiative on Debt Relief’ for developing countries, which was proposed by Islamabad and was supported by Cairo. During these meetings, the two leaders agreed to further strengthen bilateral cooperation and enhance high-level exchanges, the statement added. The three-day visit will include detailed consultations with Egyptian counterpart officials and with leading Egyptian businessmen and members of the Pakistani community. The visit is expected to further strengthen and diversify Pakistan’s bilateral ties with Egypt, noted the statement. The statement added that Egypt plays a key role in the Middle East, while its deep linkages with the African continent make it a gateway to Africa. Pakistan values its partnership with Egypt, which is in line with its desire to forge stronger ties with the Islamic world, as well as its initiative dubbed ‘Engage Africa’, the Pakistani foreign ministry’s statement pointed out. The two countries have similar perceptions on a range of regional and global issues, with more than 40 agreements signed between both sides in diverse fields, providing a firm basis for enhanced cooperation. Bilateral cooperation is advanced through strong institutional mechanisms, including the Joint Ministerial Commission, Annual Bilateral Consultations, and Joint Business Council, the statement added.

News article:
Qureshi conveyed to Sisi a message from the Pakistani president that includes an official invitation to visit Islamabad Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi said on Wednesday that Cairo welcomes the development of bilateral cooperation with Pakistan, and is keen to enhance coordination on various regional issues so as to develop bilateral cooperation and exchange expertise in various fields. This came, according to a presidential statement, during El-Sisi's meeting with Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in the presence of his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry. El-Sisi also said that Egypt "is keen on strengthening coordination and consultation with Pakistan" on various regional issues and issues of common interest, at the top of which is combating terrorism and extremist ideology, which is one of the most important challenges facing the two countries. Similar to Pakistan's war against terrorism in the Kashmir region, Egypt has been fighting an Islamist insurgency led by the Islamic State’s branch in North Sinai, formerly known as Ansar Beit El-Maqdis, since 2013. Earlier in the same day, during his press conference with Shoukry, Qureshi stressed that Egypt and Pakistan are able to establish a network to eradicate terrorism and intolerance. El-Sisi and Qureshi reviewed the latest developments in the Middle East and the Islamic world. They both emphasised the importance of continuing intensive coordination and pushing forward joint efforts to maintain regional and international peace and security and combat terrorism, the statement said. They also agreed to intensify efforts to correct religious discourse and spread the true religion of Islam. "Egypt considers Pakistan with great regard and appreciation as one of the largest Islamic countries," El-Sisi said. Official invitation to visit Pakistan Qureshi conveyed to El-Sisi a message from the Pakistani president that included an official invitation to visit Pakistan, the Egyptian presidency said. The Pakistani minister said that this comes within the framework of the depth of relations between the two friendly countries and peoples, with the aspiration to explore new horizons for bilateral cooperation between Egypt and Pakistan. Qureshi also emphasised that "Egypt's stability is a pillar of stability in the Middle East and the Islamic world as a whole." The Pakistani minister also conveyed the greetings of Pakistan's prime minister, who lauded the inspiring Egyptian experience, represented by the huge achievements Egypt has witnessed during the past years in various fields with the wise leadership and insightful vision of El-Sisi. Such achievements start with combating terrorism and achieving security and stability, and the efforts to achieve comprehensive development through deep economic reform as well as establishing mega national projects, Qureshi said. Pakistan looks upon the development experience of Egypt with admiration in light of the similarities of the situations in both countries and the common challenges facing them, Qureshi said. El-Sisi asked Qureshi to convey his greetings to Pakistan's President Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Imran Khan, while hailing the historical relations between the two countries. Egypt and Pakistan have had official diplomatic relations since 1948. Egypt was one of the first countries in the Middle East to open an embassy in Pakistan after its independence. Boosting economic relations Presidential spokesperson Bassam Rady said that El-Sisi's meeting with Qureshi also tackled strengthening the frameworks for bilateral cooperation between the two countries in a number of fields in a manner that is consistent with the status and potential of the two countries and that meets the aspirations of their peoples. According to a Monday statement by the Pakistani foreign ministry, Qureshi's visit would include detailed consultations with Egyptian officials and with leading Egyptian businessmen and members of the Pakistani community. The visit is also expected to further strengthen and diversify Pakistan’s bilateral ties with Egypt, the statement said. While in his meeting with Shoukry earlier on Wednesday, Qureshi said that various agreements would be signed between the two countries during his visit. Rady said that among the discussed fields of cooperation are security and economic cooperation, in addition to trade and investment exchange, including exploring horizons for economic cooperation between Pakistan's Gwadar Port and Egypt's Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCEZ) to establish integrated industrial projects within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative. Given the amount of traffic expected to hit the Pakistani port and Egypt's SCEZ in the coming years due to being two of the major spots on China’s Belt and Road Initiative, observers believe that the Pakistani minister's visit to Cairo will boost economic relations and enhance the partnership between both countries. In 2018, the Egyptian-Pakistani Forum explored the economic opportunities from the exact approach. The forum at the time was organised by Islamabad's South Asian Strategic Stability Institute in Egypt to mark the 70th anniversary of the beginning of relations between the two countries.

News article:
Egypt and Pakistan are able to create a network to eradicate terrorism and intolerance, the Pakistani foreign minister said Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said on Wednesday that “there is a great compatibility” between Cairo and Islamabad regarding their visions. Qureshi’s remarks came during a press conference held in Cairo with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry, which followed the official bilateral talks between the two parties. Qureshi is on a three-day visit to Egypt, which started on Tuesday, upon invitation by Shoukry. During his speech, the Pakistani foreign minister explained that the bilateral talks dealt with regional issues of common interest. He also revealed that he has discussed with Shoukry means to enhance cooperation at all levels, adding that various agreements would be signed between the two countries during his visit. Cairo and Islamabad have established official diplomatic relations since 1948. Egypt was one of the first countries in the Middle East to open an embassy in Pakistan after its independence. According to a Monday statement by the Pakistani foreign ministry, Qureshi’s visit would include detailed consultations with Egyptian counterpart officials and with leading Egyptian businessmen and members of the Pakistani community. The visit is also expected to further strengthen and diversify Pakistan’s bilateral ties with Egypt, the statement says. Moreover, Qureshi thanked, during his speech, President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi for his support to Pakistan and all developing countries. This comes as a result of a phone call in 2020 between Pakistan’s Prime Minister, Imran Khan, and El-Sisi regarding the “Global Initiative on Debt Relief” for developing countries over coronavirus concerns, which was proposed by Islamabad and was supported by Cairo. On the other hand, Qureshi stressed that Egypt and Pakistan are able to establish a network to eradicate terrorism and intolerance. “The Pakistani people want to live in peace with all neighbours,” the Pakistan’s foreign minister said, adding that the conflict in Kashmir has led to a deterioration of economic conditions.

News article:
Egypt plays a key role in the Middle East, while its deep links with the African continent make it a gateway to Africa,” read the statement issued by the Pakistani Foreign Ministry ahead of Pakistani Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi’s three-day visit to Egypt. Qureshi arrived in Cairo on Tuesday night, Doaa El-Bey reports. Pakistan and Egypt enjoy close relations, share a common faith, culture and values, and face similar challenges when it comes to coronavirus and terrorism, noted Ali Al-Hefni, former deputy to Egypt’s Foreign Minister. “It is therefore important to hold periodic bilateral meetings to discuss issues of common interest,” he said, adding that “the two countries have similar views on a range of regional and international issues.” Egypt is in a position to open doors for Pakistan in Africa. “During its chairmanship of the African Union in 2019, Egypt noticeably improved its relations with African states and can help Pakistan enhance its presence in Africa. And in the light of the ongoing rivalry between India and Pakistan, it is only to be expected that Pakistan will seek to open up its relations across the African continent, not least in response to the India-Africa Forum, an official platform for African-Indian relations that holds regular summits,” Al-Hefni added. During the three-day visit, Islamabad also hoped to benefit from Egypt’s expertise in social housing. Pakistan is currently considering expanding its densely populated cities. The crises in Libya and Syria were also high on the agenda. Qureshi’s visit included consultations with Egyptian officials and businessmen, as well as members of the Pakistani community in Egypt. They discussed ways to strengthen bilateral trade and develop scientific and cultural cooperation. The visit also tackled the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic and ways of combating terrorism. Qureshi’s visit followed an invitation from his Egyptian counterpart, Sameh Shoukri, and came on the back of meetings between Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi and Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan. The two leaders met on the sidelines of the summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Mecca in 2019 and at the 74th session of the UN General Assembly in New York the same year. During the meetings the two leaders agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation and enhance high-level exchanges. Last year, Khan discussed his Global Initiative on Debt Relief in a telephone conversation with Al-Sisi. The initiative aims to provide debt relief for developing countries and free up funds to fight the coronavirus pandemic. In the most recent call between Shoukri and Qureshi in December the two ministers expressed a desire for continuous coordination. Cairo and Islamabad have jointly signed more than 40 agreements and work together closely in the multilateral arena, in particular the United Nations, OIC and the Non-Aligned Movement. *A version of this article appears in print in the 18 February, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
The President's statement came during a virtual preparatory meeting ahead of the fifth high-level African Constitutional Conference set to be hosted in Cairo this year Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi told the heads of African constitutional and supreme courts and constitutional councils that constitutions should always be reviewed and updated to keep up with challenges affecting the fast-changing world. In a speech Saturday during the virtual preparatory meeting Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC) hosted ahead of the fifth high-level African Constitutional Conference, El-Sisi asked participating parties to discuss the challenges that face the continent and to work collectively to set joint constitutional rules to support visions. He said the meeting is meant to bring African judicial bodies under one umbrella. El-Sisi added that the status quo forces African countries to deal with the repercussions of the pandemic, adding that the digital transformation requires regulating the legal framework to manage cybersecurity and social media platforms. “The status quo requires us to think collectively in dealing with emerging challenges from the pandemic from a legal and constitutional perspective, and other traditional challenges, led by cooperation for combating terrorism as an obstacle for development and stability,” he said. Combating terrorism, therefore, requires contributions through constitutional law mechanisms to eliminate imminent threats, especially amid efforts to make Africa a unified and harmonious continent, he said. El-Sisi said that the unprecedented and accelerated shift towards digital transformation in societies, the rehabilitation of healthcare systems, and the transition towards a green economy were among emerging challenges arising from the pandemic. He said these changes require “the availability of the [needed] modern constitutional infrastructure capable of dealing with the challenges.” El-Sisi stressed the necessity of regulating the legal framework dealing with cybersecurity, legal governance for social media platforms and its content, and others related to large databases and personal information of citizens. El-Sisi highlighted Egypt’s efforts in the past few years to undertake effective steps towards providing the needed infrastructure to achieve the digital transformation of governmental services. Such steps have emerged as crucial amid the pandemic outbreak, he said. The president invited the participants to benefit from the digital judicial platform launched in previous meetings for the benefit of Africa. The fifth high-level African Constitutional Conference is scheduled to be held later this year in Cairo, according to a SCC statement on Friday. Saturday’s meeting, held under the auspices of President El-Sisi, was chaired by the head of the SCC, Chancellor Said Marei, and attended by senior African judges and international experts, the statement added. The meeting tackled the agenda that will be discussed during the conference, including the "E-justice in Africa since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic," according to Adel Omar Sherif, the vice-chairperson of the SCC.

The President's statement came during a virtual preparatory meeting ahead of the fifth high-level African Constitutional Conference set to be hosted in Cairo this year Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi told the heads of African constitutional and supreme courts and constitutional councils that constitutions should always be reviewed and updated to keep up with challenges affecting the fast-changing world. In a speech Saturday during the virtual preparatory meeting Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC) hosted ahead of the fifth high-level African Constitutional Conference, El-Sisi asked participating parties to discuss the challenges that face the continent and to work collectively to set joint constitutional rules to support visions. He said the meeting is meant to bring African judicial bodies under one umbrella. El-Sisi added that the status quo forces African countries to deal with the repercussions of the pandemic, adding that the digital transformation requires regulating the legal framework to manage cybersecurity and social media platforms. “The status quo requires us to think collectively in dealing with emerging challenges from the pandemic from a legal and constitutional perspective, and other traditional challenges, led by cooperation for combating terrorism as an obstacle for development and stability,” he said. Combating terrorism, therefore, requires contributions through constitutional law mechanisms to eliminate imminent threats, especially amid efforts to make Africa a unified and harmonious continent, he said. El-Sisi said that the unprecedented and accelerated shift towards digital transformation in societies, the rehabilitation of healthcare systems, and the transition towards a green economy were among emerging challenges arising from the pandemic. He said these changes require “the availability of the [needed] modern constitutional infrastructure capable of dealing with the challenges.” El-Sisi stressed the necessity of regulating the legal framework dealing with cybersecurity, legal governance for social media platforms and its content, and others related to large databases and personal information of citizens. El-Sisi highlighted Egypt’s efforts in the past few years to undertake effective steps towards providing the needed infrastructure to achieve the digital transformation of governmental services. Such steps have emerged as crucial amid the pandemic outbreak, he said. The president invited the participants to benefit from the digital judicial platform launched in previous meetings for the benefit of Africa. The fifth high-level African Constitutional Conference is scheduled to be held later this year in Cairo, according to a SCC statement on Friday. Saturday’s meeting, held under the auspices of President El-Sisi, was chaired by the head of the SCC, Chancellor Said Marei, and attended by senior African judges and international experts, the statement added. The meeting tackled the agenda that will be discussed during the conference, including the "E-justice in Africa since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic," according to Adel Omar Sherif, the vice-chairperson of the SCC.

Traditional trade ties with MENA nations vital for post-Brexit UK Zaid M. Belbagi Turkish Trade Minister, Ruhsar Pekcan and the UK's Ambassador to Turkey Dominick Chilcott attend the signing ceremony of Free Trade Agreement between Turkey and the UK. (File/Getty Images) Short Url https://arab.news/4d3f5 The UK’s departure from the EU has created fear and anxiety over its economic impact. Responsible for 43 percent of UK exports and 53 percent of its imports, the bloc constitutes a key trading partner for the country. Their parting has, however, invigorated London’s efforts to strengthen ties with emerging markets just beyond Europe, including Turkey, Egypt and Morocco. Such trade relationships have existed for centuries and, to many, represent a reversion to a buccaneering and internationally geared Britain that has always sought trade beyond Europe. Where such trade may have historically been exploitative and one-sided, the Brexit phenomenon has made a new relationship an imperative for all parties. For a country that brought the world free trade, the departure from what was a trading bloc may seem incongruous. However, what it has precipitated is an effort to reinvigorate an international trade policy known as “Global Britain.” In seeking to navigate its new geopolitical landscape, the UK government is seeking new commercial opportunities beyond the realm of Brussels. Turkey began its accession process to the EU 25 years ago but it seems no closer to achieving this goal than it was at the beginning. Despite the accession of states with lower levels of development to the EU, the admittance of a Muslim-majority country to a club of European states remains improbable. The UK, however, is no longer bound by the EU’s convoluted Turkey policy and can build a relationship that complements the fact it is the second-largest export destination for Turkish goods. Turkey and the UK signed a free trade agreement on Dec. 29 last year, just before the end of the Brexit transition period. Under this deal, Turkish and British companies can continue to export and import under preferential tariffs. According to Turkish trade analyst Mustafa Oguz, “Turkey is the UK’s 19th-largest trading partner, accounting for 1.3 percent of its total trade in 2019. There is a real opportunity to explore ties with the UK whilst trade contracts with the EU.” Though cooperation with Europe was no doubt transformational, Britain’s worldview was under-exercised while a member of the EU. Zaid M. Belbagi Egypt, with a population a quarter of the size the EU’s, is an important market for the UK. As Europe ages, young nations like those in the Arab world will become critical to international trade, especially for the UK. Bilateral trade in 2019 reached £3.6 billion ($5.05 billion) and UK exports to Egypt accounted for £2.3 billion. This foundation was essential to the association agreement signed by the two nations in early December to replace the Egypt-EU Association Agreement that previously governed relations. The accord was an important proof of concept for the UK, which would have otherwise reverted to World Trade Organization most-favored-nation terms of trade, under which Egypt would have imposed tariffs of up to 19 percent on UK goods. In not only providing a market for Egyptian goods, but also the opportunity to grow the export of UK services to Egypt, which most recently were valued at £826 million, the agreement will reintegrate the UK with a nation it has a long-standing association with. Having neglected relationships “East of Suez” in the late 1960s as it pursued the European Common Market, the UK can now benefit from more widespread international relationships in key growth markets like Egypt. Arguably among the most exciting prospects for UK trade just outside the euro zone is with Morocco. Not only have the two countries had diplomatic relations for more than 800 years, but they are also neighboring countries through the British Mediterranean possession of Gibraltar. Geographic proximity and trade complementarities provide a strong basis upon which to build trade. Most importantly, however, the growth of integral Moroccan infrastructure has the potential to provide an important hub for UK trade in Africa. Though Spanish ports have traditionally dominated the freight traffic between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, the thriving new Moroccan rival at Tanger Med last year processed 20 percent more cargo than in 2019, making it the area’s busiest container port. Though Morocco has done a great deal to integrate itself with the European single market, trade with the UK requires a greater focus — despite their historic ties, the UK is only the eighth-largest investor in Morocco. The Gibraltar-Tangier tunnel plan, which is now being given serious thought, has the potential to connect two continents and provide a conduit for trade that would greatly offset the UK’s short-term costs of leaving the EU. As in the case of other long-standing relationships London has, its ties with Morocco require a review in light of Brexit. A trade partner with cheaper labor costs and an increasingly high-quality infrastructure network can contribute as a key hub for UK business in Africa. The historian Niall Ferguson described the Victorians, who escorted the world into a British vision of free trade, as being advocates of policies that could have been “just published by the International Monetary Fund, if not the World Bank: Free trade, balanced budgets, sound money, the common law, incorrupt administration and investment in infrastructure financed by international loans.” His analysis, though coy, does highlight that the UK’s post-Brexit policy is far more aligned with the country’s traditional internationalist outlook than the constraints of the EU allowed. Though cooperation with Europe was no doubt transformational, Britain’s worldview was under-exercised while a member of the EU. Developing trade with traditional partners in the Middle East and North Africa region is a great opportunity for the UK to both reconfigure its economic policy and to pick up the thread as a go-to international partner for emerging markets.

News article:
Cohen revealed that the US has invested over $80 billion in Egypt over the last 43 years. The US is optimistic about Egypt’s economy and is aware of the many opportunities that can be tapped in the market by American businesspersons and companies, according to the US Ambassador to Egypt, Jonathan Cohen. Ambassador Cohen made his statements to the monthly webinar held on Tuesday virtually by the American Chamber of Commerce in Cairo. Building partnerships, creating platforms of collaboration, and tapping the opportunities the Egyptian market has were the key areas that Cohen touched upon. Cohen asserted the robust partnership between the US and Egypt that has lasted for decades in the areas of military, diplomacy, and economy. He highlighted cooperation between the two countries in several issues, including the COVID-19 crisis, the Libyan issue, and the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, as well as continuing to support the peace process in the region. “The United States has provided longstanding assistance to Egypt’s military, economy, and cultural institutions, helping make the country more resilient through our security partnership, educational and cultural exchanges, and development work,” said Cohen. Moreover, Cohen revealed that the US has invested over $80 billion in Egypt over the last 43 years. He also lauded Egypt’s economic reform programme, which was implemented between 2016 through 2019, saying that it helped Egypt accumulate the buffers that helped the country navigate the ongoing crisis. These reforms have led Egypt to witness a positive growth in 2020, the only country in the region to do so, according to the International Monetary Fund’s estimations. Moreover, Cohen highlighted Egypt’s position as the first destination for foreign direct investments in Africa. Global credit institutions have also praised Egypt’s economy and its resilience in the face of the pandemic, according to Cohen. Cohen pinpointed the opportunities that the Egyptian economy has, especially in education, information and communication technology (ICT), entrepreneurship, transportation, fintech, e-commerce, health tech, power, and oil and gas sectors, urging American companies to tap such opportunities. Regarding ICT, Cohen said that it represents the fastest growing sector in the Egyptian economy, growing by 35 percent in 2020. He asserted the significant opportunities that the sector has, especially with the pandemic’s implications and how they have proven the major role the sector can play in times of crises. In terms of transportation, the ambassador said that Egypt’s minister of transport has announced 31 transport projects, which are open to investment, calling interested American investors to take advantage of such opportunities. “Egypt is investing in its economic future by launching new transportation and infrastructure projects linking Egyptian cities and ports with global markets,” said Cohen. Concerning entrepreneurship, Cohen emphasised the private sector’s importance in driving Egypt’s growth and in creating job opportunities, especially with the fast growing population of the country. In this regard, Cohen pointed to the American-Egyptian Entrepreneurship Fund that dedicates $300 million for supporting entrepreneurs and SMEs in Egypt, adding that 700 entrepreneurs have benefitted from the fund so far. Regarding healthcare, Cohen said that the medical city that Egypt is establishing in the new Administrative Capital also has significant investment opportunities for American business owners, particularly in supplying it with the required medical devices and in exchanging experiences. In terms of the energy sector, Cohen stressed the US’ support to Egypt for its aspiration to be an energy hub, calling American investors to benefit from the investment opportunities the sector provides at the present time. He also noted that agri-business in Egypt has critical opportunities for American investors, especially in know-how technologies, unveiling that US agricultural exports to Egypt grew by 23 percent in 2020, despite the pandemic, while Egypt’s agricultural exports to the US increased by 22 percent in the same year. Cohen invited American companies to expand their current business in Egypt and to tap current investment opportunities, illustrating that the US embassy is ready to provide to them with market insights, data on Egypt’s economic condition, as well as linking them with decision makers.

These reforms have led Egypt to witness a positive growth in 2020, the only country in the region to do so, according to the International Monetary Fund’s estimations. Moreover, Cohen highlighted Egypt’s position as the first destination for foreign direct investments in Africa. Global credit institutions have also praised Egypt’s economy and its resilience in the face of the pandemic, according to Cohen. Cohen pinpointed the opportunities that the Egyptian economy has, especially in education, information and communication technology (ICT), entrepreneurship, transportation, fintech, e-commerce, health tech, power, and oil and gas sectors, urging American companies to tap such opportunities. Regarding ICT, Cohen said that it represents the fastest growing sector in the Egyptian economy, growing by 35 percent in 2020. He asserted the significant opportunities that the sector has, especially with the pandemic’s implications and how they have proven the major role the sector can play in times of crises. In terms of transportation, the ambassador said that Egypt’s minister of transport has announced 31 transport projects, which are open to investment, calling interested American investors to take advantage of such opportunities. “Egypt is investing in its economic future by launching new transportation and infrastructure projects linking Egyptian cities and ports with global markets,” said Cohen. Concerning entrepreneurship, Cohen emphasised the private sector’s importance in driving Egypt’s growth and in creating job opportunities, especially with the fast growing population of the country. In this regard, Cohen pointed to the American-Egyptian Entrepreneurship Fund that dedicates $300 million for supporting entrepreneurs and SMEs in Egypt, adding that 700 entrepreneurs have benefitted from the fund so far. Regarding healthcare, Cohen said that the medical city that Egypt is establishing in the new Administrative Capital also has significant investment opportunities for American business owners, particularly in supplying it with the required medical devices and in exchanging experiences. In terms of the energy sector, Cohen stressed the US’ support to Egypt for its aspiration to be an energy hub, calling American investors to benefit from the investment opportunities the sector provides at the present time. He also noted that agri-business in Egypt has critical opportunities for American investors, especially in know-how technologies, unveiling that US agricultural exports to Egypt grew by 23 percent in 2020, despite the pandemic, while Egypt’s agricultural exports to the US increased by 22 percent in the same year. Cohen invited American companies to expand their current business in Egypt and to tap current investment opportunities, illustrating that the US embassy is ready to provide to them with market insights, data on Egypt’s economic condition, as well as linking them with decision makers.

The private sector should direct its investments to state projects, Madbouly said Egypt counts on the private sector to raise growth levels through its investments in the government's projects and initiatives, said Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly at a webinar organised by the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Egypt on Thursday. Madbouly added that the government has allocated EGP 500 billion for the Decent Life initiative and its affiliated projects despite the coronavirus crisis and the subsequent pressure on the state budget. The projects of the initiative are meant to upgrade the infrastructure of Egyptian villages, improve the quality of life of their people, create job opportunities, reduce the harsh repercussions of the pandemic on the vulnerable, and enable them to access basic needs and services, Madbouly said. The private sector should play a pivotal role in this regard through investing in the initiative’s projects. “We will not continue to spend more and more from the state budget in such projects. The private sector should be at the fore, directing its investments to state projects.” Madbouly urged American investors to tap the opportunities that Egypt have, asserting Egypt’s desire for more involvement in the Egyptian economy by the US private sector. He noted that US investments in Egypt stood at about $23 billion in 2020. The prime minister stated that COVID-19 has caused the harshest impact on the economy in seven decades. He highlighted the precautionary and pre-emptive measures that Egypt adopted during the first wave of the pandemic that contributed to, together with the successful economic reform programme, making Egypt the only country in the region to see positive growth in 2020 and to navigate the crisis with minimum losses. He noted that the government managed to set the balance between preserving public health and managing the economy without resorting to a total lockdown. The measures included allocating EGP 100 billion to mitigate the repercussions of the pandemic, appropriating a total of EGP 13 billion to support the export sector, applying a comprehensive system of detecting and tracking infected cases, launching the Universal Health Insurance system, and securing the basic food and medical supplies the market needs. On the support Egypt’s banking sector extended, Madbouly explained that it has allocated EGP 50 billion to back real-estate for low and middle-income classes and EGP 20 billion to support the stock market. Egypt has also launched launching other initiatives that target boosting the private sector, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and retail loans. “Egypt is focused now on regaining its macroeconomic pre-pandemic levels. For this purpose, we are working on upgrading the country’s road networks, ports, and implementing projects that secure a sustainable and resilient economy, including establishing sustainable cities, such as the New Administrative Capital,” Madbouly said. He underscored Egypt’s strategic target to be a regional energy hub, noting that the private sector has a critical role to play in this regard and has the chance to tap the significant opportunities that the sector provides. Madbouly added that Egypt targets securing 20 percent of its energy needs from renewable resources by 2022. He said the country has started the vaccination process already, adding that Egypt has contracted with the COVAX Coalition to receive vaccine shipments in a bid to secure the country’s needs. Coronavirus infections in Egypt are now under control, however, he added. Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of the International Affairs Division at the US Chamber of Commerce in Washington, said that the US business community is focusing on investing in healthcare, fintech, digitisation, agri-business, and energy in Egypt. Brilliant added that the US business community is committed to strengthening bilateral economic relations and investing in Egypt’s growth, stressing that the US businesspersons in Washington and Egypt are paying great attention to investing in Egypt and to bring new investors to the domestic market as well. He lauded Egypt’s economic and structural reforms that enabled the country to navigate the crisis with resilience and strength. Search Keywords: Short link:

Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly gave a speech via video conference in an African Union (AU) meeting on behalf of the president Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi stressed on Wednesday the importance of intensifying international cooperation to eradicate the coronavirus pandemic and its implications in Africa through efforts including fair vaccine distribution among countries. Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly delivered El-Sisi's statement in a speech via video conference in an African Union (AU) meeting. French President Emmanuel Macron, Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi, who is the current chair of the AU, and African leaders participated in the meeting. In the speech, El-Sisi urged continuing coordination between the African Union and international partners to support the health systems in Africa. He also affirmed the importance of cooperation to enable the African continent to produce coronavirus vaccine doses amid challenges related to the production capacities and fair distribution of medicines and vaccines. In this regard, El-Sisi expressed appreciation for his French counterpart’s efforts to continuously coordinate with AU member states in order to support the health and medical systems in Africa against the pandemic and enable African countries to have fair access to vaccine doses in the appropriate time and with acceptable prices. The president also hailed Macron’s representation of the African voice at the latest Group of Seven Summit, saying that this representation contributed positively to the G7 Leaders statement released after the summit. According to the 19 February statement, the G7 Leaders committed over $4 billion to the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator ACT-A and the Gavi-led global initiative aimed at equitable access to coronavirus vaccines, known as COVAX. This raised the collective G7 support to $7.5 billion. In an interview with the Financial Times in February, Macron proposed that rich Western countries give 3 to 5 percent of their current coronavirus vaccine stock to Africa. “I would like to emphasise that our African peoples deserve a lot from us in order to advance our health system,” El-Sisi’s statement said. He added that advancing the African health system requires “continuing our relentless efforts to develop our continental work and international solidarity in order to overcome the negative challenges the coronavirus pandemic has posed.” “Let us always bear in mind the aspirations and hopes of our African peoples, who rely on us in securing the vaccine. This invites us to speak with one voice in all regional and international forums, to ensure the advancement of the African health system,” the president added. Search Keywords: Short link:

Sudan’s Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Mohamed Othman al-Hussein said the agreement aims to achieve national security for both countries. Exchanged visits by Egyptian and Sudanese military officials have increased after the ouster of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in 2019. Farid led on Monday a high-ranking military delegation to take part in the seventh meeting of the Egyptian-Sudanese Military Committee in Khartoum. In November 2020, the first phase of the Egyptian-Sudanese air force military drill, dubbed” The Nile Eagles 1,” kicked off in Khartoum. The Egyptian and Sudanese special and air forces carried out the drill, which was the first of its kind between the two neighboring countries. According to Farid, Tuesday’s visit aims at supporting military and security cooperation to bolster bilateral capabilities and confront challenges facing both countries’ national security. Cairo is ready to meet Khartoum’s demands in all military fields, as part of the unprecedented military bilateral cooperation.

News article:
Against the backdrop of various high-level meetings between Egypt and Sudan, President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi is expected to visit the Sudanese capital Khartoum between Thursday and Saturday, according to informed government sources. The expected presidential visit comes shortly after Egypt extended an invitation to Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Homdok to visit Cairo. It also comes after President Al-Sisi received Mariam Sadek Al-Mahdi, Sudan’s newly appointed minister of foreign affairs, in Cairo. Most significantly, it comes hours after top military personnel from both Egypt and Sudan signed a new agreement on military cooperation in Khartoum. On Tuesday, the military chiefs-of-staff of Egypt and Sudan, Mohamed Farid and Mohamed Othman, respectively, said that the military cooperation agreement was set to allow for closer cooperation on all issues of relevance to national security in every possible way and on every front. “We are faced with common regional threats, and we have to work together to face these threats on all fronts,” Farid said. Also on Tuesday, this time in Cairo, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri and Al-Mahdi were echoing their equal determination for joint coordination to take place in the negotiations with Ethiopia over the construction, filling, and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), a mega-dam built on the Blue Nile in Ethiopia without the agreement of the two downstream countries of Egypt and Sudan. The two ministers called for international mediation to facilitate a legally binding agreement with Ethiopia ahead of the second filling of the dam that Addis Ababa is planning to execute this summer without the agreement of either Cairo or Khartoum, just as it did last summer during the first filling of the dam. Khartoum has requested the Democratic Republic of Congo, the current chair of the African Union (AU), to engage the UN, the EU, and the US to help push for a deal on the dam in the coming weeks or months. In Cairo, Egypt’s top diplomat gave his full support to the proposal on Tuesday. “We are seeing a moment in which Egypt and Sudan have the equal political will to consolidate cooperation to serve their common interests,” said another Egyptian diplomat. “We don’t necessarily agree on everything, but we do agree that we need one another to help face up to some serious threats,” he added. According to this diplomat and to a Sudanese diplomat, both speaking on condition of anonymity, the GERD is a pressing concern for both countries, though it is not the only one. They said that the security of the Horn of Africa and the situation in the Sahel and Sahara, with its impact on the overall situation in North and East Africa, were also matters of concern for both countries. “Sudan stands at a strategically sensitive point between the Sahel and the Sahara and the Red Sea coast. This area faces serious security threats, including trafficking by militant groups, arms, and drugs,” the Egyptian diplomat said. He added that the new military pact that Egypt and Sudan signed in Khartoum on Tuesday would help both countries coordinate their security strategy “on these very troubling fronts”. “We have been seeing an increase in militant activities all along the shores of the Red Sea, especially around Somalia and Eritrea, and we have been monitoring the infiltration of militants that are being pushed through into the Sahel and Sahara zone to end up first in Chad and then in Libya,” the Egyptian diplomat said. He added that Egypt was “discussing military cooperation deals with several other countries in both the Horn of Africa and the Sahel and Sahara,” stating that “we have good reasons to want to act promptly there. We cannot just let things go.” According to the Sudanese diplomat, Khartoum is equally keen to avoid possible militant infiltration. The country has recently seen its name removed from the US list of countries supporting terrorism, and it is hoping for stability and security in order to be able to better position itself as an attractive destination for investment and to help a frail economy get back on its feet. “In this respect, we welcome cooperation with Egypt to serve the interests of our two countries,” he said. What is mostly at stake today, however, according to both diplomats, is security in the Red Sea. With the fluid situation in Yemen that is verging on the status of becoming a failed or non-viable state and the growing foreign military presence in and around the ports of the Red Sea, both Egypt and Sudan need to make sure that they are alert to possible security breaches. Both Egypt and Sudan are members of the recently launched Red Sea Forum along with six other countries from Africa and Asia. However, as the Egyptian and Sudanese diplomats said, what Egypt and Sudan share is perhaps much more than either shares with the other members of the forum. Late last year, Egypt and Sudan carried out their first joint military drills called Nile Eagles-1. These were conducted in Sudan. According to Egyptian and Sudanese diplomatic sources, future naval drills could be coming up this year. The prospects of military cooperation, crucial as it is for both countries, and the question of the equally crucial GERD negotiations are not the only matters of common interest for Cairo and Khartoum. Economic cooperation in gas and oil, mining, agriculture, and trade are also of interest to both Egypt and Sudan. Cairo and Khartoum have been slowly but surely discussing major schemes for economic cooperation that would cover agriculture and industry. The launch of these could be announced during the visit by Hamdok to Cairo in the coming days or weeks. “Much will depend on the talks that President Al-Sisi will be holding in Khartoum. This visit is a very firm show of the commitment on the side of Egypt at the highest level to reach out to Sudan. It shows that for Egypt Sudan matters whoever is ruling in Khartoum,” the Egyptian diplomat said. According to Amany Al-Tawil, a senior Sudan expert at the Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, the current movement in Egyptian-Sudanese relations will produce a new framework for bilateral relations between the two Nile Basin countries. “I think we are about to see qualitative progress in cooperation between the two countries. We are seeing the beginning of an unprecedented process of strategic bonding,” Al-Tawil said. *A version of this article appears in print in the 4 March, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

The second edition of the Aswan Forum shed light on challenges facing the African continent. Covid-19 topped the list Policymakers and experts are expected to develop context-specific and action-oriented recommendations as to how Africa can recover from the coronavirus pandemic after the Aswan II Forum ends on 5 March. Through the so-called “Aswan Conclusions”, African, national, regional and continental stakeholders, together with global partners, are expected to join forces to ensure that the ramifications of the pandemic do not impede the achievement of the African Union’s 2063 Agenda “The Africa We Want”. The Aswan Forum II was held this week under the theme “Shaping Africa’s New Normal: Recovering Stronger, Rebuilding Better”. The forum’s second edition was held virtually starting 1 March. The first was held in December 2019 in Aswan. In the keynote speech that he delivered in the opening session, Egypt’s Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri highlighted the importance of joint African action and “diligent work” to achieve peace and development in the continent. More importantly, he stressed the importance of finding ways to deal with the impact of Covid-19 on various fields and trying to find the required solutions to the unprecedented challenge in a way that realises the targets of the AU’s 2063 Agenda and the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. “The pandemic contributed to exacerbating the traditional challenges that Africa faces in the fields of peace and security. Thus, it is important to bolster African countries’ capabilities to face the present security challenges, topped by combating terrorism and foreign terrorists,” Shoukri said in his address to the inaugural session. In his speech, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi highlighted that Egypt was keen to hold the second edition of the forum to use the momentum generated by the first edition and its successes. “Driven by its faith, Egypt believes that the present time is optimum to discuss together the daunting challenges facing our continent to seek the best ways and mechanisms to shore up our common efforts to get over the pandemic and to rebuild better to take our continent to safety,” he said. Al-Sisi described the activation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) earlier this year as a “good example of the success of our collective work”. He said that besides the challenge of Covid-19, the continent was still suffering from the danger of armed conflicts and civil wars, as well as organized crime, the spread of weapons, illegal emigration and forced displacement. “All these challenges require joint efforts to support the mechanism that stops and settles conflicts and enhances the continent’s abilities to face these challenges.” Thus, he said, African and international solidarity is an urgent matter for humanity to overcome these challenges as well as that of the coronavirus. “The current stage has brought new challenges, foremost of which is providing the necessary vaccine for our peoples. I would like to emphasise the necessity of providing such a vaccine in a more equitable and just manner in response to the demands of the peoples of our continent,” he said. Al-Sisi’s speech was followed by addresses from several other African presidents, including those of Rwanda, Burundi, Tunisia, and South Sudan who agreed that the continent is passing through exceptional circumstances and that solidarity and joint work is the only way to deal with the challenge. UN Secretary-General António Guterres and Chairperson of the African Union Commission Musa Faki participated in the forum. Guterres called for a global vaccination plan that makes the coronavirus vaccines available and equally distributed. He also urged the international community to support the world’s most vulnerable people and countries by taking various measures, from strengthening health systems to providing debt relief. “Pandemic recovery is also an opportunity to address the fragilities and inequalities that have been exposed by the pandemic, and to pursue a more inclusive and sustainable path that advances gender equality and safeguards the global environment,” he said in his address to the opening session. Guterres concluded by praising the Africans’ efforts to advance the well-being of the continent’s people. “The United Nations will continue to support Africa’s efforts across this agenda, including silencing the guns,” Guterres said. Faki said that the pandemic revealed the dire need for African countries to build more resilient economies to face crises. He highlighted the need to work on establishing a new healthcare system and building health capacities to ensure proper healthcare to all Africans. The first day’s sessions of the forum were devoted to discussing the impact of the pandemic, ways to recover from it, how to strengthen sustainable peace and development, and the need for an integrated response to the growth of terrorism in the shadow of the pandemic. The AU theme for the forum is “Arts, Culture and Heritage: Levers for Building the Africa We Want”. The issue was discussed in detail on the third day. Soft power was said to be likely to bring nations together in a way that helps them address challenges with enlightened thought that fits the culture and civilisation of the African nations. It also tackled other fields, including enhancing intra-African trade after the launch of the AfCFTA in January. The forum, which saw the participation of African leaders, senior officials and heads of governments, will end on Friday with the closing session “Chartering Africa’s Way Forward: Recovering Stronger Rebuilding Better”. The event is organised by the Cairo International Centre for Conflict Resolution, Peacebuilding and Peacekeeping. *A version of this article appears in print in the 4 March, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

The image shows a healthcare worker taking a swab from a patient to test for Covid-19. This is an important step in the fight against the pandemic, as it helps to identify and isolate infected individuals. The image is therefore highly relevant to the news events set, which focuses on the impact of Covid-19 on Africa and the efforts being made to recover from the pandemic. However, the specific event depicted in the image does not reflect the events in the set of news events. The image is therefore not aligned with the news events set.

The image is complementary to the news events set because it provides a visual representation of the impact of Covid-19 on Africa. The image shows a patient being tested for the virus, which is a common experience for many people in Africa. The image also shows the healthcare worker wearing protective gear, which is a reminder of the risks that healthcare workers face in their efforts to fight the pandemic. The image is therefore a powerful reminder of the human cost of the pandemic and the importance of the efforts being made to recover from it.

The second edition of the Aswan Forum shed light on challenges facing the African continent. Covid-19 topped the list Policymakers and experts are expected to develop context-specific and action-oriented recommendations as to how Africa can recover from the coronavirus pandemic after the Aswan II Forum ends on 5 March. Through the so-called “Aswan Conclusions”, African, national, regional and continental stakeholders, together with global partners, are expected to join forces to ensure that the ramifications of the pandemic do not impede the achievement of the African Union’s 2063 Agenda “The Africa We Want”. The Aswan Forum II was held this week under the theme “Shaping Africa’s New Normal: Recovering Stronger, Rebuilding Better”. The forum’s second edition was held virtually starting 1 March. The first was held in December 2019 in Aswan. In the keynote speech that he delivered in the opening session, Egypt’s Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri highlighted the importance of joint African action and “diligent work” to achieve peace and development in the continent. More importantly, he stressed the importance of finding ways to deal with the impact of Covid-19 on various fields and trying to find the required solutions to the unprecedented challenge in a way that realises the targets of the AU’s 2063 Agenda and the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. “The pandemic contributed to exacerbating the traditional challenges that Africa faces in the fields of peace and security. Thus, it is important to bolster African countries’ capabilities to face the present security challenges, topped by combating terrorism and foreign terrorists,” Shoukri said in his address to the inaugural session. In his speech, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi highlighted that Egypt was keen to hold the second edition of the forum to use the momentum generated by the first edition and its successes. “Driven by its faith, Egypt believes that the present time is optimum to discuss together the daunting challenges facing our continent to seek the best ways and mechanisms to shore up our common efforts to get over the pandemic and to rebuild better to take our continent to safety,” he said. Al-Sisi described the activation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) earlier this year as a “good example of the success of our collective work”. He said that besides the challenge of Covid-19, the continent was still suffering from the danger of armed conflicts and civil wars, as well as organized crime, the spread of weapons, illegal emigration and forced displacement. “All these challenges require joint efforts to support the mechanism that stops and settles conflicts and enhances the continent’s abilities to face these challenges.” Thus, he said, African and international solidarity is an urgent matter for humanity to overcome these challenges as well as that of the coronavirus. “The current stage has brought new challenges, foremost of which is providing the necessary vaccine for our peoples. I would like to emphasise the necessity of providing such a vaccine in a more equitable and just manner in response to the demands of the peoples of our continent,” he said. Al-Sisi’s speech was followed by addresses from several other African presidents, including those of Rwanda, Burundi, Tunisia, and South Sudan who agreed that the continent is passing through exceptional circumstances and that solidarity and joint work is the only way to deal with the challenge. UN Secretary-General António Guterres and Chairperson of the African Union Commission Musa Faki participated in the forum. Guterres called for a global vaccination plan that makes the coronavirus vaccines available and equally distributed. He also urged the international community to support the world’s most vulnerable people and countries by taking various measures, from strengthening health systems to providing debt relief. “Pandemic recovery is also an opportunity to address the fragilities and inequalities that have been exposed by the pandemic, and to pursue a more inclusive and sustainable path that advances gender equality and safeguards the global environment,” he said in his address to the opening session. Guterres concluded by praising the Africans’ efforts to advance the well-being of the continent’s people. “The United Nations will continue to support Africa’s efforts across this agenda, including silencing the guns,” Guterres said. Faki said that the pandemic revealed the dire need for African countries to build more resilient economies to face crises. He highlighted the need to work on establishing a new healthcare system and building health capacities to ensure proper healthcare to all Africans. The first day’s sessions of the forum were devoted to discussing the impact of the pandemic, ways to recover from it, how to strengthen sustainable peace and development, and the need for an integrated response to the growth of terrorism in the shadow of the pandemic. The AU theme for the forum is “Arts, Culture and Heritage: Levers for Building the Africa We Want”. The issue was discussed in detail on the third day. Soft power was said to be likely to bring nations together in a way that helps them address challenges with enlightened thought that fits the culture and civilisation of the African nations. It also tackled other fields, including enhancing intra-African trade after the launch of the AfCFTA in January. The forum, which saw the participation of African leaders, senior officials and heads of governments, will end on Friday with the closing session “Chartering Africa’s Way Forward: Recovering Stronger Rebuilding Better”. The event is organised by the Cairo International Centre for Conflict Resolution, Peacebuilding and Peacekeeping. *A version of this article appears in print in the 4 March, 2021 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Search Keywords: Short link:

'My first trip was to South Sudan, my second was to Egypt,' said Khartoum's new top diplomat Sudan's Foreign Minister Mariam Al-Saddiq Al-Mahdi expressed on Thursday her country’s keenness to enhance cooperation with Egypt, saying Khartoum's relations with Cairo are strategic to security in the region. "My first trip was to South Sudan, my second was to Egypt," said Al-Mahdi as she addressed policy experts and journalists at Egypt's Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies (ACPSS) in Cairo. Al-Mahdi said that Sudan's relations with Egypt are "of strategic importance to the security of the region," adding that both states share African and Islamic identities and are part of the Nile Basin group of states and the international community. She also called for establishing an Egyptian-Sudanese dialogue on how to develop relations between the two states in the future. On Tuesday, Al-Mahdi met her Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry, where the latter said that Egypt supports Sudan’s recent suggestion regarding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) negotiations. Sudan recently called for international mediation in the stalled GERD talks, involving a quartet committee composed of the United Nations, the African Union, the European Union and the United States, in order to reach a legally binding agreement with Ethiopia on the filling and operation of the dam. “The second filling of the GERD endangers the lives of 20 million Sudanese citizens,” the Sudanese minister said. Al-Mahdi said that both Egypt and Sudan are committed to reaching a legally binding agreement on the filling and operation of the dam before the second filling. Last month, the daughter of Sudan's former premier and Al-Umma Party leader Saddiq Al-Mahdi, was appointed as top diplomat in Abdallah Hamdok's new cabinet. Shoukry congratulated her at the time for becoming Khartoum's new prime minister in a phone call and invited her to visit Cairo at the earliest opportunity. Search Keywords: Short link:

American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) is calling on its supporters to urge US senators to seek a broader nuclear agreement with Iran, media reported on Saturday. According to a text message cited by Press TV, AIPAC says that Iran “Israel's and America's greatest threat in the Middle East,” and asks its supporters to convince US lawmakers to sign the Menendez/Graham draft letter that opposes reviving the 2015 agreement in its current form. “Please urge your senators to sign a bipartisan letter to President Biden... expressing the bipartisan consensus that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose a grave threat to US national security interests and our allies and partners,” said the group. While this call is not rejecting the idea of reviving the deal, AIPAC has also launched a campaign against the deal itself.

News article:
Reviving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran is supposed to be one of President Joe Biden's landmark foreign policy achievements. A return to compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal would, according to its supporters, end the immediate threat of a nuclear-armed Iran and take the heat out of simmering tensions across the Middle East, allowing Biden to refocus U.S. foreign policy on its next great challenges, especially China. The Biden administration and President Hassan Rouhani's government in Tehran both want to revive the JCPOA. But their window is closing. The U.S. and Iran have spent the first months of the year stuck in a stalemate, waiting for the other to blink first. Rouhani's term will end in June when Iranians head to the polls. The country's ruling clerics are all but certain to pave the way for a hardliner to become the next president, perhaps even a candidate drawn from the ranks of the zealous Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). As Iranian activity slows during its Nowruz new year holiday, there are no signs of an imminent breakthrough between Washington, D.C. and Tehran. After the holiday, the presidential election campaign will kick into a higher gear. Less than three months into his term, Biden might have already missed his shot. "I have a hard time believing that if Rouhani is gone, the JCPOA is going to be viable," said Sina Toossi, a senior research analyst at the National Iranian American Council. Rouhani has "fought tooth and nail" to keep the deal alive despite domestic skepticism, Toossi added, but his options are almost exhausted. "Rouhani's hands are largely tied, he's a true lame duck," he said. Rouhani and his Foreign Minister Javad Zarif have weathered much domestic criticism of the JCPOA and recently had to defend their desire to revive the accord to the conservative-dominated parliament. With the end of the Rouhani era in sight, the momentum is with the conservatives. Donald Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018 and subsequent sanctions campaign vindicated those Iranians who were skeptical of engaging with the U.S. in the first place. The assassinations of Major General Qassem Soleimani and nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh are further evidence for the skeptics that the U.S. and its allies cannot be trusted to engage in good faith. Deterrence is the order of the day, they say, at the heart of which could sit a nuclear arsenal. Above all other concerns sits the security of the Islamic Republic. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is 81 and unwell. Several past reports of his imminent demise have proved unfounded, but Khamenei knows his time is nearly up. The regime has resorted to mass violence to suppress protests in recent years. At the end of 2019, it killed about 1,500 people in order to put down unrest sparked by a new fuel tax. Tehran has also periodically throttled internet connections to try to stem the spread of public anger at state corruption and brutality. Anti-regime sentiment in Iran is real and widespread, though there is still no realistic political alternative to marshal that anger. A conservative president—in Khamenei's words a "young and hezbollahi" (ideologically hardline) figure—would ensure a smooth transition to the next supreme leader. As Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said, this election is "all about Iran's most important voter, which is Khamenei." Among the candidates vying to be Khamenei's chosen man is Hossein Dehghan, a former IRGC air force brigadier general who served as Rouhani's defense minister. Another is Parviz Fattah, a former IRGC member who heads the Mostazafan Foundation charity, which was recently put under sanctions by the Treasury Department. A third is one of the IRGC's youngest generals, Saeed Mohammad, a 53-year-old highly educated technocrat who until recently was the commander of the guard corps' Khatam-al Anbiya engineering operation. It remains to be seen whether an IRGC or conservative candidate would—with approval from Khamenei—still pursue JCPOA revival. Iran knows it needs relief from U.S. sanctions,and hawks point to suspicions of secret nuclear sites in Iran as evidence that Tehran might continue advanced research nuclear even under a resurrected deal. But a conservative president is unlikely to prove an easier negotiating partner for Biden. There would be a "constellation of diplomacy skeptics" in such an administration, Taleblu said. This might make escalation more likely, whether through increased regional proxy attacks, covert actions or expanded nuclear activity. Then, said Toossi, "America is going to be left to choose between either launching military strikes, or it's going to come to the negotiating table and negotiate a new deal with the hardliners." For Iran hawks in Congress, the identity of Iran's next president is largely irrelevant. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) said the ayatollah-controlled regime would "continue seeking the destruction of the United States regardless of the outcomes of their sham elections." Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) dismissed the elections as "a farce controlled by the Iranian regime," one that "violated Obama's deal, funnels weapons to terrorists, takes Americans hostage, and brutally represses the Iranian people." Rubio added: "The U.S. should continue to put maximum pressure on the Iranian regime until it halts its malign and destabilizing behavior. It is in the interest of our nation's security to accept nothing less." One congressional GOP staffer told Newsweek that Republicans on Capitol Hill believe Biden is fully committed to an Obama-style approach to Iran—prioritizing a deal with Tehran over maximum pressure. Some believe Biden is genuinely trying to constrain Iran, but others fear the president will embolden the regime in its malign regional activities. Most will likely continue to defend maximum pressure and remain skeptical of diplomacy. Characterizing Biden's approach as "reckless," the congressional staffer said: "The Iranians remain a violent terrorist expansionist regime." Biden's public lack of progress on the JCPOA is concerning supporters of the accord, especially after the president's special envoy on Iran, Rob Malley, said the administration would not let the June election dictate the speed of talks. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said "the window for meaningful diplomatic engagement on Iran's nuclear activities is narrowing." Van Hollen added that he "fully" supported Biden's so far unsuccessful push for a mutual return to compliance by both sides ahead of the "likely" election of a hardliner president. "Time is of the essence to constrain Iran's nuclear program through smart diplomacy," Van Hollen said. Van Hollen and other Democrats have blamed Trump for the state of U.S.-Iran relations. "The Trump administration's reckless foreign policy moves isolated us from our allies and allowed Iran to ramp up its uranium enrichment activities, reducing its breakout time from more than a year to a matter of months today," he said, adding that Iranian hardliners had been "buoyed by the Trump administration's feckless strategy." If Biden does miss the Rouhani window, Iran's next president will try to present the U.S. with a choice between "a regional war that's going to be very costly, or a new nuclear deal that is probably less strong than the JCPOA," Toossi said. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has also acknowledged that the election will have a bearing on what role his inspectors play. Asked about the election, Grossi told Newsweek on Tuesday: "It's a factor." "I would say that in whatever scenario—hardliners, softliners, any liners—we have to solve this issue, one way or the other," Grossi said. "I hope it can be done and I think it's in everyone's interest and everyone's advantage to come to a solution to this problem, and I think the Iranians recognise this themselves." There is still hope for JCPOA progress in the coming months, even if both sides are sticking to their guns—at least publicly—and denying there has been any behind-the-scenes contact. Any success would come despite conservatives in both countries pushing to kill the deal, with the help of U.S. allies in Israel and Saudi Arabia. "There's so much pressure here," Toossi said, "from Congress, hawks, hawkish organizations, pro-Israel groups and lobbies." "I think Biden is trying to navigate this pressure," he added. "They're trying to placate a lot of these people in Congress. They ultimately do want JCPOA return, I believe, but the way they're going about it, they risk losing this opportunity."

Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) said the ayatollah-controlled regime would "continue seeking the destruction of the United States regardless of the outcomes of their sham elections." Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) dismissed the elections as "a farce controlled by the Iranian regime," one that "violated Obama's deal, funnels weapons to terrorists, takes Americans hostage, and brutally represses the Iranian people." Rubio added: "The U.S. should continue to put maximum pressure on the Iranian regime until it halts its malign and destabilizing behavior. It is in the interest of our nation's security to accept nothing less." One congressional GOP staffer told Newsweek that Republicans on Capitol Hill believe Biden is fully committed to an Obama-style approach to Iran—prioritizing a deal with Tehran over maximum pressure. Some believe Biden is genuinely trying to constrain Iran, but others fear the president will embolden the regime in its malign regional activities. Most will likely continue to defend maximum pressure and remain skeptical of diplomacy. Characterizing Biden's approach as "reckless," the congressional staffer said: "The Iranians remain a violent terrorist expansionist regime." Biden's public lack of progress on the JCPOA is concerning supporters of the accord, especially after the president's special envoy on Iran, Rob Malley, said the administration would not let the June election dictate the speed of talks. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said "the window for meaningful diplomatic engagement on Iran's nuclear activities is narrowing." Van Hollen added that he "fully" supported Biden's so far unsuccessful push for a mutual return to compliance by both sides ahead of the "likely" election of a hardliner president. "Time is of the essence to constrain Iran's nuclear program through smart diplomacy," Van Hollen said. Van Hollen and other Democrats have blamed Trump for the state of U.S.-Iran relations. "The Trump administration's reckless foreign policy moves isolated us from our allies and allowed Iran to ramp up its uranium enrichment activities, reducing its breakout time from more than a year to a matter of months today," he said, adding that Iranian hardliners had been "buoyed by the Trump administration's feckless strategy." If Biden does miss the Rouhani window, Iran's next president will try to present the U.S. with a choice between "a regional war that's going to be very costly, or a new nuclear deal that is probably less strong than the JCPOA," Toossi said. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has also acknowledged that the election will have a bearing on what role his inspectors play. Asked about the election, Grossi told Newsweek on Tuesday: "It's a factor." "I would say that in whatever scenario—hardliners, softliners, any liners—we have to solve this issue, one way or the other," Grossi said. "I hope it can be done and I think it's in everyone's interest and everyone's advantage to come to a solution to this problem, and I think the Iranians recognise this themselves." There is still hope for JCPOA progress in the coming months, even if both sides are sticking to their guns—at least publicly—and denying there has been any behind-the-scenes contact. Any success would come despite conservatives in both countries pushing to kill the deal, with the help of U.S. allies in Israel and Saudi Arabia. "There's so much pressure here," Toossi said, "from Congress, hawks, hawkish organizations, pro-Israel groups and lobbies." "I think Biden is trying to navigate this pressure," he added. "They're trying to placate a lot of these people in Congress. They ultimately do want JCPOA return, I believe, but the way they're going about it, they risk losing this opportunity."

News article:
Reviving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran is supposed to be one of President Joe Biden's landmark foreign policy achievements. A return to compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal would, according to its supporters, end the immediate threat of a nuclear-armed Iran and take the heat out of simmering tensions across the Middle East, allowing Biden to refocus U.S. foreign policy on its next great challenges, especially China. The Biden administration and President Hassan Rouhani's government in Tehran both want to revive the JCPOA. But their window is closing. The U.S. and Iran have spent the first months of the year stuck in a stalemate, waiting for the other to blink first. Rouhani's term will end in June when Iranians head to the polls. The country's ruling clerics are all but certain to pave the way for a hardliner to become the next president, perhaps even a candidate drawn from the ranks of the zealous Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). As Iranian activity slows during its Nowruz new year holiday, there are no signs of an imminent breakthrough between Washington, D.C. and Tehran. After the holiday, the presidential election campaign will kick into a higher gear. Less than three months into his term, Biden might have already missed his shot. "I have a hard time believing that if Rouhani is gone, the JCPOA is going to be viable," said Sina Toossi, a senior research analyst at the National Iranian American Council. Rouhani has "fought tooth and nail" to keep the deal alive despite domestic skepticism, Toossi added, but his options are almost exhausted. "Rouhani's hands are largely tied, he's a true lame duck," he said. Rouhani and his Foreign Minister Javad Zarif have weathered much domestic criticism of the JCPOA and recently had to defend their desire to revive the accord to the conservative-dominated parliament. With the end of the Rouhani era in sight, the momentum is with the conservatives. Donald Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018 and subsequent sanctions campaign vindicated those Iranians who were skeptical of engaging with the U.S. in the first place. The assassinations of Major General Qassem Soleimani and nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh are further evidence for the skeptics that the U.S. and its allies cannot be trusted to engage in good faith. Deterrence is the order of the day, they say, at the heart of which could sit a nuclear arsenal. Above all other concerns sits the security of the Islamic Republic. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is 81 and unwell. Several past reports of his imminent demise have proved unfounded, but Khamenei knows his time is nearly up. The regime has resorted to mass violence to suppress protests in recent years. At the end of 2019, it killed about 1,500 people in order to put down unrest sparked by a new fuel tax. Tehran has also periodically throttled internet connections to try to stem the spread of public anger at state corruption and brutality. Anti-regime sentiment in Iran is real and widespread, though there is still no realistic political alternative to marshal that anger. A conservative president—in Khamenei's words a "young and hezbollahi" (ideologically hardline) figure—would ensure a smooth transition to the next supreme leader. As Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said, this election is "all about Iran's most important voter, which is Khamenei." Among the candidates vying to be Khamenei's chosen man is Hossein Dehghan, a former IRGC air force brigadier general who served as Rouhani's defense minister. Another is Parviz Fattah, a former IRGC member who heads the Mostazafan Foundation charity, which was recently put under sanctions by the Treasury Department. A third is one of the IRGC's youngest generals, Saeed Mohammad, a 53-year-old highly educated technocrat who until recently was the commander of the guard corps' Khatam-al Anbiya engineering operation. It remains to be seen whether an IRGC or conservative candidate would—with approval from Khamenei—still pursue JCPOA revival. Iran knows it needs relief from U.S. sanctions,and hawks point to suspicions of secret nuclear sites in Iran as evidence that Tehran might continue advanced research nuclear even under a resurrected deal. But a conservative president is unlikely to prove an easier negotiating partner for Biden. There would be a "constellation of diplomacy skeptics" in such an administration, Taleblu said. This might make escalation more likely, whether through increased regional proxy attacks, covert actions or expanded nuclear activity. Then, said Toossi, "America is going to be left to choose between either launching military strikes, or it's going to come to the negotiating table and negotiate a new deal with the hardliners." For Iran hawks in Congress, the identity of Iran's next president is largely irrelevant. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) said the ayatollah-controlled regime would "continue seeking the destruction of the United States regardless of the outcomes of their sham elections." Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) dismissed the elections as "a farce controlled by the Iranian regime," one that "violated Obama's deal, funnels weapons to terrorists, takes Americans hostage, and brutally represses the Iranian people." Rubio added: "The U.S. should continue to put maximum pressure on the Iranian regime until it halts its malign and destabilizing behavior. It is in the interest of our nation's security to accept nothing less."

News article:
A bipartisan group of more than 40 senators is sounding the alarm on Iran’s nuclear program, urging President Biden to use a mix of “diplomatic and economic tools.” The letter to Biden — led by Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) — comes as Biden seeks to have the U.S. rejoin the Iran nuclear deal that former President Trump withdrew from in 2018, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). “While we may have differing views on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action of 2015 and the overall approach of the Trump Administration’s maximum pressure campaign, we must confront the reality that Iran has accelerated its nuclear activity in alarming ways including increasing its centrifuge research and production and enriching uranium up to 20 percent,” the 41 senators wrote. “Iran should have no doubt about America’s policy. Democrats and Republicans may have tactical differences, but we are united on preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon and addressing the wide range of illicit Iranian behavior,” they continued. The Biden administration has said it does not intend to lift sanctions imposed by the Trump administration that targeted a wide range of Iranian sectors until Tehran returns to compliance with the JCPOA — in particular, limiting the country’s uranium enrichment to 3.67 percent under the terms of the deal. Iran has rejected those terms, calling for the Biden administration and international community to lift sanctions imposed by the Trump administration before it will agree to return to compliance with the deal. Tehran also has threatened to ban visits by international nuclear inspectors that are required by the terms of the deal if concessions are not reached. Most Democratic lawmakers have thrown their support behind Biden’s efforts to rejoin the JCPOA. But Republicans have outright rejected rejoining the agreement even as the Biden administration says it would use it as a starting point to negotiate a “longer and stronger” deal that addresses Iran’s other behavior. This includes confronting Iran over its ballistic missile program; funding for terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East; human rights abuses against its own citizens; and politically motivated arrests of American citizens. The bipartisan letter sent Thursday acknowledged such differences between Democrats and Republicans. “Looking ahead, we strongly believe that you should use the full force of our diplomatic and economic tools in concert with our allies on the United Nations Security Council and in the region to reach an agreement that prevents Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons and meaningfully constrains its destabilizing activity throughout the Middle East and its ballistic missile program,” the senators wrote. They also raised concerns about ongoing attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq by Iranian-backed militias and called for the administration to prioritize the release of American citizens held in Iran: Baquer Namazi, Siamak Namazi, Morad Tahbaz and Emad Shargi. The lawmakers further called it “critical” for the administration to consult with key Middle East allies — Israel and Gulf nations – on a “path forward with Iran.” The bipartisan letter from senators follows an initiative by Democratic and Republican lawmakers in the House. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of 140 House lawmakers called on the Biden administration to take a “comprehensive” approach to threats posed by Iran beyond engagement on the nuclear deal.

News article:
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has dug up an old Biden tweet and used it to attack his administration's stubborn intransigence on returning to the JCPOA. "It's sadly ironic that the State Department is now calling on Iran to abide by the very deal the Trump administration abandoned", Zarif wrote, citing verbatim an excerpt from a tweet by then-presidential candidate Joe Biden from June 2019. "It's sadly ironic that the State Dept is now calling on Iran to abide by the very deal the Trump administration abandoned."@POTUS, 2019 Your admin follows Trump's footsteps while trying to use his unlawful sanctions as "leverage". Nasty habits die hard. Time to kick this one. pic.twitter.com/PIhN1YwT3e — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) March 30, 2021 "Your administration follows Trump's footsteps while trying to use his unlawful sanctions as 'leverage'. Nasty habits die hard. Time to kick this one", the foreign minister suggested, encouraging the US president to live up to his own rhetoric. Zarif's commentary was accentuated by his decision to change his profile pic to a hilarious caricature of himself. The diplomat indicated on his Instagram page that he plans to use caricatures created throughout his seven-and-a-half-year tenure as foreign minister throughout the remainder of his term, which is expected to wrap up in June after presidential elections.

News article:
One of the unidentified individuals informed the outlet that the proposal is “more than anything about trying to get the conversation started” between the two countries, which have been at odds for decades and saw tensions hit a new boiling point under the Trump administration. A looming expiration to an agreement between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is also serving as a push to establish renewed talks. The deal between the pair allows the UN watchdog to continue inspections of its nuclear facilities, but is due to expire in June and take with it the agency’s access to Iranian facilities. Shahrokh Nazemi, the head of press at Iran’s mission to the United Nations, responded to the Politico revelation by indicating that “the [deal] needs no specific proposal,” and that the US just needs to follow implementation of the 2015 agreement. The Biden camp did not offer details of the ongoing diplomatic talks. In 2018, the Trump administration walked away from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which in turn re-imposed sanctions on Iran, and initiated even stricter financial hurdles as Trump sought a “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran. As a result, Tehran has taken several steps against denuclearization and argues that since the US abandoned the deal first, they should take the first step in renegotiating and ultimately removing sanctions. Biden stated on the campaign trail that he wanted to reverse his predecessor’s actions against Iran. However, he has been working under the assumption that he will either remake or at least update the 2015 deal. Most recently, the Biden White House has stated that sanctions will not be lifted unless Iran returns to compliance with the original deal. Reports have indicated that the US is willing to make the first move in returning to negotiations. Biden is facing increased tension in competition as Iran continues its attempt at nuclear growth including signing a $400 billion deal with China, which includes investment into the renewable energy and nuclear energy infrastructure. — Permanent Mission of China in Vienna (@ChinaMissionVie) March 29, 2021 ​European officials have also attempted to salvage the agreement, setting up talks between Iran and the US, an effort subsequently rejected by both parties. — Saeed Khatibzadeh (@SKhatibzadeh) February 28, 2021 ​Europe faces its own challenge of encountering US sanctions of their own if they attempt to do business with Iran.

News article:
By desperately seeking Iran's return to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear accord, the Biden administration is squandering the vast economic leverage bequeathed to it by the Trump administration. President Joe Biden is encouraging Iran to play hardball in negotiations pertaining to its return to compliance with the nuclear deal. It has just been announced that the United States will participate in a meeting in Vienna on Tuesday with Iran. Also included will be the other signatory members of the nuclear accord — Britain, China, France, Germany, and Russia. But while the U.S. is expected to play a passive role in these discussions, the Iranians evidently believe that they now hold the strategic initiative. Iran's Fars News state media outlet reported one Iranian official's comment on Friday that no negotiations were necessary. This is because, the official said, "The United States can return to the agreement and end lawbreaking just in the way that it pulled out of it and imposed illegal sanctions against Iran." This is not the rhetoric of a regime desperate for sanctions relief. This is the rallying cry of a regime that senses appeasement has returned to American foreign policy. Biden is making a huge mistake. The appropriate way to deal with Iran is for Biden to hold true to what he pledged to do in early February — to keep all U.S. sanctions in place until Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suspends his enrichment of uranium beyond purity caps imposed under the 2015 accord. That strategy would ensure that Iran's leaders are the ones begging for a deal, rather than the other way around. It would also recognize the basic reality that Iran's economic collapse, precipitated in large part by the Trump administration's sanctions, has greatly damaged the patronage relationships upon which Tehran's hard-liner elite root their power. These sanctions have also restrained the regime's ability to export the revolution. Unfortunately, the Biden administration now appears willing to sacrifice this leverage. On Friday, an administration official told the New York Times that "the United States would not seek to retain some sanctions for leverage ... arguing that the previous 'maximum pressure' campaign waged against Iran by the Trump administration had failed." This is absurd. The Biden administration has the very same access to U.S. intelligence reporting on Iran as the Trump administration did. In turn, Biden and his senior officials should be confident that were they willing to maintain sanctions pressure, Iran would be forced into a desperate negotiating stance. Absent that desperate negotiating, the regime's very survival would come under question. Recent years have seen escalating street protests and a fundamental collapse of the Revolutionary Guard Corps finance structures. How much more of that strain can Khamenei's regime handle? It's a question he most certainly does not want to answer. Intelligence on this reality is surely why Biden was willing to play hardball back in February. It's not clear why Biden abandoned his previously prudent strategy. But the shift in Biden's position is obvious. Washington is even now begging the Chinese to persuade the Iranians to give some ground. The Chinese have, of course, loved this show of desperation from Washington and delivered nothing in return. On the contrary, Beijing has just given Iran the economic gift of a 25-year strategic partnership. Iran is now sitting pretty. Expect Biden to suspend major U.S. sanctions in return for Iran's reduction of some enrichment activities. Iran will get its payday and the fundamental flaws of the 2015 accord, such as Iran's ballistic missile research, will remain in place.

When President Biden was vice president during the Obama administration, the administration was all too eager to grant concessions to the Iranian regime and, it turns out, made multiple secret deals with the mullahs….. These secret deals meant that when sanctions against Iranian banks were lifted and permission given to the leaders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to resume conducting business, there was no longer any mechanism to check or stop Iran’s illegal activities such as advancing its ballistic missile program. The Obama administration also helped swiftly to lift all four rounds of UN sanctions against Iran — sanctions it had taken decades to put in place. Iran’s military sites also were exempted from inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency; other inspections were only to be at the times and places of Iran’s choosing — if ever. Another concession, usually overlooked, is that Iran never even signed the JCPOA deal — what sort of deal, then, is that? Appeasement policies, secret deals and generous concessions to predatory regimes do not work, as history has repeatedly shown. They only empower and embolden leaders whose record reveals that they have no intention of honoring whatever they agreed to in the first place, and for whom commitments have been mainly a means of buying time to accomplish the goals they really want. The Biden administration is ratcheting up its appeasement policies towards the Iranian regime in an apparent effort to revive the 2015 nuclear deal — which by the way, Iran never signed. US President Joe Biden made his intention to return to the nuclear deal public before he took office; after, he appointed as Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman — a key negotiator in the talks which led to the nuclear deal in 2015 during the Obama administration. Biden actually publicized Sherman’s professed accomplishment: “She has successfully rallied the world to strengthen democracy and confront some of the biggest national security challenges of our time, including leading the U.S. negotiating team for the Iran Deal”. The administration proceeded to revoke the designation of the Houthis, an Iran-backed terror group, as an officially-designated terrorist organization. Republican foreign policy leaders in Congress are now requesting from the Secretary of State Antony Blinken answers to questions about the secret talks held with South Korea that resulted in South Korea giving the Iranian regime $1 billion in ransom money. The letter was “led” by Congressman Bryan Steil (WI), Congressman Greg Steube (FL) and Republican Study Committee (RSC) Chairman Jim Banks (IN). Steil pointed out: “The Biden administration appears to be using loopholes when dealing with the Iranian regime. I am again asking direct, yes or no questions on the United States’ involvement in facilitating a South Korean ransom payment to Iran. If the Biden administration is involved in transferring funds to Iran, Congress and the American people must be informed. Biden administration officials continue to deflect and refuse to answer questions from members of Congress regarding this issue. I want answers. Congress must be informed of the administration’s actions”. In January, the Iranian regime, apparently as part of an extortion maneuver, had seized a South Korean ship in the Gulf and demanded ransom for its release. Congressman Banks stated: “The Biden administration has to stop stonewalling and must come clean regarding whether they facilitated sanctions relief for the thugs in Tehran. I’m glad to co-lead this letter with my colleagues Rep. Bryan Steil and Rep. Greg Steube. The RSC will continue to investigate until we get to the bottom of what is going on”. Secret talks to appease the Iranian regime should not come as surprise. When President Biden was vice president during the Obama administration, the administration was all too eager to grant concessions to the Iranian regime and, it turns out, made multiple secret deals with the mullahs. One of the secret deals consisted of allowing the Iranian regime to have access to US dollars by sidestepping sanctions. “The Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran”, said Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), who chaired the Senate panel conducting the investigation at the time. The Obama administration also secretly agreed to remove sanctions on several Iranian banks, including Bank Sepah and Sepah International. These banks had long been sanctioned by the United Nations due to their illegal activities in financing missile development and skirting UN Security Council resolutions regarding the arms embargo. These secret deals meant that when sanctions against Iranian banks were lifted and permission given to the leaders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to resume conducting business, there was no longer any mechanism to check or stop Iran’s illegal activities such as advancing its ballistic missile program. When, in return for Iran releasing hostages, the Obama administration released Iranian-born prisoners, some of whom were threats to the US national security, it shocked many and infuriated some of the officials at the Justice Department — as did shipping $400 million in cash to Tehran as ostensibly a “not quid-pro-quo” ransom for the hostages. In addition, according to a report by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, the Obama administration agreed “‘in secret’ to allow Iran to evade some restrictions” in the last year of the nuclear agreement. David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector, stated that “The exemptions or loopholes are happening in secret, and it appears that they favor Iran.” These are only few examples of the secret deals conducted with the Iranian regime to appease it. In addition to the secret deals, Iran also received dangerous and unprecedented concessions from the Obama administration for the Islamic Republic’s 2015 “nuclear deal,” the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The major concession was that the deal paved the way for Iran legally to become a full-blown nuclear state. The sunset clauses, which enshrined that commitment, had set a firm expiration date for restricting Iran’s nuclear program, after which the country’s leaders would be free to have, legitimately, as many nuclear weapons as they like. The Obama administration also helped swiftly to lift all four rounds of UN sanctions against Iran — sanctions it had taken decades to put in place. Iran’s military sites also were exempted from inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency; other inspections were only to be at the times and places of Iran’s choosing — if ever. Iran then rejoined the global financial system with full legitimacy — plus billions of dollars flowing into the treasury of the IRGC and its expanding militias across the Middle East. Another concession, usually overlooked, is that Iran never even signed the JCPOA deal — what sort of deal, then, is that? Appeasement policies, secret deals and generous concessions to predatory regimes do not work, as history has repeatedly shown. They only empower and embolden leaders whose record reveals that they have no intention of honoring whatever they agreed to in the first place, and for whom commitments have been mainly a means of buying time to accomplish the goals they really want.

News article:
The Biden administration is moving forward on steps to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, with officials set to participate in high level discussions with signatories to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in Vienna next week. The U.S. and Iran are not expected to meet face to face, although administration officials have said they remain open to direct talks. The Vienna meeting marks the most forward movement for the Biden team, which will engage with European, Russian and Chinese counterparts over what steps the U.S. can take to achieve a “mutual return” for both America and Iran. The meeting is likely to draw intense scrutiny from Capitol Hill, where hundreds of lawmakers have signed on to a handful of letters to the president and Secretary of State Antony Blinken over their concerns of engaging with Iran. The House Foreign Affairs Committee led by Chairman Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), tweeted support for the meeting. “This is an important, though preliminary step. Tough and smart diplomacy in close coordination with our European allies and regional partners is the best way to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and restore full compliance with the JCPOA,” he said. President Biden has made rejoining the deal a priority foreign policy for his administration. He appointed as U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley, a key member of the negotiating team that brokered the 2015 agreement. The deal, negotiated during the Obama administration while Biden was vice president, put significant, but temporary, limits on Iran’s nuclear capabilities in exchange for sanctions relief from the U.S. and international community. Critics argue it did not go far enough in preventing Iran from ever attaining a nuclear weapon and did not address a range of malign activity by the Islamic Republic, including its ballistic missile programs, support for proxy fighting forces across the Middle East, support for terrorism and human rights abuses. “The United States must not once again abandon the leverage that is bringing Iran back to the negotiating table without confronting both Iran’s nuclear and non-nuclear activities that need to be stopped,” 140 House Republicans wrote in a letter to President Biden in February, opposing a return to the JCPOA. The former Trump administration reimposed sanctions on Iran when it withdrew from the deal in May 2018, and added an array of other punitive measures as part of a “maximum pressure campaign” aimed at forcing Tehran to the negotiating table for a stronger agreement. Tehran maintains its nuclear program is peaceful but nuclear watchers say the Islamic Republic is likely only a few months away from building a bomb. Iran began increasing its uranium enrichment in 2019, breaking the terms of the JCPOA in retaliation for the sanctions imposed by the then-Trump administration. The Biden team and Iran have been in a “who goes first” conundrum over each side’s demands. The U.S. has been worried by Iran’s enrichment of uranium up to 20 percent, far above the deal’s limit of 3.67 percent. Uranium is considered weapons grade when enriched to approximately 90 percent. The Biden team has called on Iran to reverse its uranium enrichment before sanctions are eased. Tehran calls this a nonstarter. The meeting in Vienna will seek to establish a road map of steps both sides can take to bring them back to compliance with the deal, including identifying “sanctions lifting and nuclear implementation measures,” according to a statement released Friday by the JCPOA signatories — China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and Iran. State Department Principal Deputy spokesperson Jalina Porter said in a briefing with reporters that the U.S. would not preview any specific sanctions to be lifted, but that sanctions relief steps will be discussed during the meeting. “We’re going to talk about nuclear steps that Iran would need to take in order to return to compliance with the terms of the JCPOA and, we won’t preview any specific sanctions, but we’ll definitely say that sanction relief steps that the U.S. would need to take in order to return to that compliance as well, we’ll be up for discussion,” she said. Naysan Rafati, senior Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group, said that both Washington and Tehran are in agreement about returning to the JCPOA, but that the path to mutual compliance is not going to be easy. “The discussions are likely to encounter challenges regarding scope and sequencing on both the nuclear and sanctions relief fronts, as well as skepticism in Washington as well as Tehran,” he said. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have sought to close the gap on their disagreements of the utility of the JCPOA as part of efforts to promote a united front in their opposition to Iran’s alleged pursuit of a nuclear weapon and destabilizing actions in the region. Last month, 40 senators from both sides of the aisle signed a letter to the president urging the use of all diplomatic and economic tools to prevent Iran from developing the ability to attain a nuclear weapon. “Iran should have no doubt about America’s policy. Democrats and Republicans may have tactical differences, but we are united on preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon and addressing the wide range of illicit Iranian behavior. We look forward to working with you to achieve these objectives,” the senators wrote. Likewise, a bipartisan letter signed by 140 House members called for addressing the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran and its other troubling actions. “As Democrats and Republicans from across the political spectrum, we are united in preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon and addressing the wide range of illicit Iranian behavior,” they wrote. Lawmakers are also concerned over sanctions relief for Iran without meaningful verification that it has taken steps to put itself back in compliance with the JCPOA. Secretary of State Antony Blinken answered in the affirmative when questioned by Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) during a hearing last month that the U.S. would not make any concessions to get a meeting with Iran nor lift sanctions until Iran is verifiably in full compliance with the JCPOA, or on a negotiated path toward full compliance. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) further pressed Blinken to commit to formally consulting with Congress before lifting any sanctions. “We’re determined to consult on the takeoff not on the landing across the board — but, yes particularly when it comes to Iran,” Blinken said.

The former Trump administration reimposed sanctions on Iran when it withdrew from the deal in May 2018, and added an array of other punitive measures as part of a “maximum pressure campaign” aimed at forcing Tehran to the negotiating table for a stronger agreement. Tehran maintains its nuclear program is peaceful but nuclear watchers say the Islamic Republic is likely only a few months away from building a bomb. Iran began increasing its uranium enrichment in 2019, breaking the terms of the JCPOA in retaliation for the sanctions imposed by the then-Trump administration. The Biden team and Iran have been in a “who goes first” conundrum over each side’s demands. The U.S. has been worried by Iran’s enrichment of uranium up to 20 percent, far above the deal’s limit of 3.67 percent. Uranium is considered weapons grade when enriched to approximately 90 percent. The Biden team has called on Iran to reverse its uranium enrichment before sanctions are eased. Tehran calls this a nonstarter. The meeting in Vienna will seek to establish a road map of steps both sides can take to bring them back to compliance with the deal, including identifying “sanctions lifting and nuclear implementation measures,” according to a statement released Friday by the JCPOA signatories — China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and Iran. State Department Principal Deputy spokesperson Jalina Porter said in a briefing with reporters that the U.S. would not preview any specific sanctions to be lifted, but that sanctions relief steps will be discussed during the meeting. “We’re going to talk about nuclear steps that Iran would need to take in order to return to compliance with the terms of the JCPOA and, we won’t preview any specific sanctions, but we’ll definitely say that sanction relief steps that the U.S. would need to take in order to return to that compliance as well, we’ll be up for discussion,” she said. Naysan Rafati, senior Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group, said that both Washington and Tehran are in agreement about returning to the JCPOA, but that the path to mutual compliance is not going to be easy. “The discussions are likely to encounter challenges regarding scope and sequencing on both the nuclear and sanctions relief fronts, as well as skepticism in Washington as well as Tehran,” he said. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have sought to close the gap on their disagreements of the utility of the JCPOA as part of efforts to promote a united front in their opposition to Iran’s alleged pursuit of a nuclear weapon and destabilizing actions in the region. Last month, 40 senators from both sides of the aisle signed a letter to the president urging the use of all diplomatic and economic tools to prevent Iran from developing the ability to attain a nuclear weapon. “Iran should have no doubt about America’s policy. Democrats and Republicans may have tactical differences, but we are united on preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon and addressing the wide range of illicit Iranian behavior. We look forward to working with you to achieve these objectives,” the senators wrote. Likewise, a bipartisan letter signed by 140 House members called for addressing the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran and its other troubling actions. “As Democrats and Republicans from across the political spectrum, we are united in preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon and addressing the wide range of illicit Iranian behavior,” they wrote. Lawmakers are also concerned over sanctions relief for Iran without meaningful verification that it has taken steps to put itself back in compliance with the JCPOA. Secretary of State Antony Blinken answered in the affirmative when questioned by Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) during a hearing last month that the U.S. would not make any concessions to get a meeting with Iran nor lift sanctions until Iran is verifiably in full compliance with the JCPOA, or on a negotiated path toward full compliance. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) further pressed Blinken to commit to formally consulting with Congress before lifting any sanctions. “We’re determined to consult on the takeoff not on the landing across the board — but, yes particularly when it comes to Iran,” Blinken said.

The image shows Iranian President Hassan Rouhani speaking at a news conference in Tehran. Rouhani is a key figure in the Iranian government and his statements on the nuclear deal are likely to be closely watched by the international community. The image is therefore relevant to the news events set, which includes articles about the Biden administration's efforts to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. However, the specific event depicted in the image does not reflect the events in the news events set, as the image was taken in 2019, while the news events set focuses on the Biden administration's efforts to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal in 2021. The visual information in the image can complement the news events set as a whole, as it provides a visual representation of one of the key figures involved in the negotiations.


News article:
The Biden administration is moving forward on steps to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, with officials set to participate in high level discussions with signatories to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in Vienna next week. The U.S. and Iran are not expected to meet face to face, although administration officials have said they remain open to direct talks. The Vienna meeting marks the most forward movement for the Biden team, which will engage with European, Russian and Chinese counterparts over what steps the U.S. can take to achieve a “mutual return” for both America and Iran. The meeting is likely to draw intense scrutiny from Capitol Hill, where hundreds of lawmakers have signed on to a handful of letters to the president and Secretary of State Antony Blinken over their concerns of engaging with Iran. The House Foreign Affairs Committee led by Chairman Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), tweeted support for the meeting. “This is an important, though preliminary step. Tough and smart diplomacy in close coordination with our European allies and regional partners is the best way to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and restore full compliance with the JCPOA,” he said. President Biden has made rejoining the deal a priority foreign policy for his administration. He appointed as U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley, a key member of the negotiating team that brokered the 2015 agreement. The deal, negotiated during the Obama administration while Biden was vice president, put significant, but temporary, limits on Iran’s nuclear capabilities in exchange for sanctions relief from the U.S. and international community. Critics argue it did not go far enough in preventing Iran from ever attaining a nuclear weapon and did not address a range of malign activity by the Islamic Republic, including its ballistic missile programs, support for proxy fighting forces across the Middle East, support for terrorism and human rights abuses. “The United States must not once again abandon the leverage that is bringing Iran back to the negotiating table without confronting both Iran’s nuclear and non-nuclear activities that need to be stopped,” 140 House Republicans wrote in a letter to President Biden in February, opposing a return to the JCPOA.

News article:
Despite being the most powerful nation in the world, the last U.S. election exposed the fragility of American democracy. It highlighted the need to continually work toward improving and fostering our democratic institutions. While the ethos of U.S. militarism in recent decades emphasized the dangers of foreign foes, the Trump presidency and its unprecedented attacks on the most basic principles of American democracy substantiated President Abraham Lincoln's claim that true danger to the U.S. would come from within: "It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher." In order to nurture democracy, President Joe Biden should abide by its core belief to carry out the will of the people. His administration's openness to diplomacy with Iran reflects that very will. In the case of U.S. foreign policy, the American public made its position clear. Poll after poll indicate that the majority of Americans wish to end endless wars and ensure national and global security through diplomacy. The news that the U.S. and Iran agreed to indirect talks to discuss returning to the nuclear deal is a step in that direction and demonstrates welcome progress toward peace. As President Biden talks of unity, the desire to avoid military confrontation with Iran and resolve the nuclear issue with diplomacy has bipartisan support. A recent The Economist/YouGov poll showed that a majority of Americans view Iran's nuclear program as a threat, with 63 percent supporting direct negotiations with Iran to address their concern. Upon a closer look, 84 percent of Biden voters polled supported direct negotiations, along with 54 percent of Trump voters. These numbers corroborate CNN polling from May 2018, after former President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Iran deal—also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—which showed 63 percent of Americans believe the U.S. should not quit the deal. That Trump's "maximum pressure" policy on Iran was a complete failure, which brought us to the brink of war, only reaffirmed the need to return to diplomacy. As such, during his campaign, Biden remained a staunch critic of Trump's Iran policy and signaled his support for returning to the deal, along with almost every other Democratic candidate. Though Biden and key figures within his administration were outspoken in their rebuke of Trump's Iran policy, the administration was initially slow to take real steps toward returning to the deal. Polling of Americans under the Biden administration continues to demonstrate that the majority support a return to mutual compliance by the United States and Iran. From a global perspective, American allies in Europe worked to save the deal in spite of efforts by the Trump administration to completely dismantle it. They pressed the Biden administration early on to take proactive steps toward sanctions relief to restore the agreement as soon as possible. While Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu's infamous anti-Iran posturing is often presented as being representative of all Israeli society, senior ranking Israeli defense and security officials came out in favor of Biden returning to the JCPOA and acknowledged its effectiveness. Domestically, pressure is growing among Biden supporters, including progressive and faith-based groups, for him to rejoin the nuclear deal. Many of these supporters expected faster action from the new administration and fear that the window for diplomacy may be narrow with an Iranian election on the horizon in June. The current Rouhani government, which staked its administration on the success of the JCPOA and the hoped-for economic relief for millions of Iranians, repeatedly stated that Iran will swiftly return to compliance if the U.S. does the same. In addition to appeals from Biden supporters to return to the deal, there is also the pressing matter of sanctions relief due to the COVID pandemic. This has drawn criticism from U.S. civil society organizations who called on Biden to provide sanctions relief. Although the Biden administration expressed intent to review sanctions for the purposes of humanitarian assistance in the pandemic just days after taking office, more than two months later no such relief has been given as all Trump-era sanctions on Iran remain in place. Biden's unhurried approach to COVID sanctions relief is in stark contrast to his own words last year, which called on Trump to "take immediate steps to address this problem and streamline channels for banking and public health assistance from other countries in response to the health emergency in Iran." In the same statement, Biden alluded to the unique role of the U.S. in world affairs and asserted that, "In times of global crisis, America should lead." If the U.S. is to take on such leadership while preserving its own democracy, President Biden should heed the calls of the majority of Americans and the people who voted him into office. His own desire to return to diplomacy was signaled again with the U.S. decision to join indirect talks with Iran along with international intermediaries, but this decision will be met with opposition from the same people and groups that sabotaged the diplomatic gains of the Obama-Biden administration. War hawks and fringe groups determined for regime change in Iran at any cost should not be the arbiters of America's Iran policy. Instead, our policies on Iran should reflect the will of the American people, who have shown time and again their desire for diplomacy over war. If democracy should prevail, Biden will soon return to the Iran nuclear deal. The president should feel confident in doing so because it's what Americans want.

News article:
A senior Chinese diplomat endorsed Iran’s negotiating position during a high-stakes meeting about the rehabilitation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, even as President Joe Biden hopes Beijing will be a “partner” in these negotiations. “This is a question involving the fundamental principle of rights and wrongs. As a victim, Iran's legitimate requirement should, in the first place, be affirmed and catered for,” Chinese Ambassador Wang Qun, the top Chinese diplomat to the United Nations in Vienna, told state media. “In order to break the current impasse, it is imperative that the U.S. return to the JCPOA at an early date by lifting all unlawful and unilateral sanctions.” Those comments align Chinese General Secretary Xi Jinping’s regime with Tehran’s hard-line posture, as Iranian officials pressure Biden to dismantle former President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” unilaterally. Biden’s team has denounced Trump’s policy but avoided lifting the sanctions, citing the need to ensure that Iran likewise returns to compliance with the deal while laying the groundwork for additional measures to restrain Iranian aggression — an initiative that U.S. officials hope will find support even among American rivals. “I think principally and strategically, this is an area where we do have aligned interests with Moscow and aligned interests with Beijing,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters Tuesday. “They have sought to uphold the JCPOA, and we do see them as partners in this fairly narrow effort.” US AIR FORCE B-52 BOMBERS FLY OVER MIDDLE EAST IN SHOW OF FORCE AS TENSIONS FLARE WITH IRAN That analysis misunderstands China’s position, according to Iran hawks skeptical of Biden’s approach to managing threats posed by the Gulf regime. Iran signed up for China’s Belt and Road Initiative last month, as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced a “permanent and strategic” partnership between Beijing and Tehran. “The Chinese see this as a zero-sum game: They see American power and prestige as a threat to the expansion of their influence, [which leads Beijing to the conclusion that] anything that puts the U.S. in a stronger geopolitical position is bad for China,” the Heritage Foundation’s James Carafano argued. Some members of the Trump administration shared Price’s perception of China’s posture earlier in their tenure, but that view was shaken by Beijing’s insistence on purchasing Iranian oil despite the threat of U.S. sanctions. “We literally offered the Chinese to replace Iranian oil, barrel for barrel, with the Saudis ... and they still pursued illicit means of importing Iranian crude,” a former Trump administration official said. That experience impelled a reassessment of China’s intentions. “They clearly see [Iran] as a potential client-state in the Middle East,” the former official said. “I think, in their mind, they actually believe the JCPOA limits Iran’s nuclear advancement and therefore is the de-escalation they need to prevent any war in the Middle East ... [but] it's not just about the oil supply. There is something more about being with non-U.S.-aligned power in the region. That’s not the U.S. position, despite Blinken’s support for the nuclear deal. “Our strategy sees the mutual return to the JCPOA as necessary but insufficient,” Price told reporters Wednesday. “We seek not only a longer and stronger deal, but over the longer term, working with partners in the region, follow-on agreements to address [Iranian human rights abuses, support for terrorism, and missile development]. We don't need to arrive at those follow-on agreements for us to hold Iran to account for its behavior because we will continue to do that right now.” Blinken’s point man for the Iran talks, special representative Rob Malley, is in Vienna for a meeting of the nuclear agreement signatories — an assembly that U.S. officials regard as “a healthy step forward” toward Biden’s desired goal, as Price put it Tuesday. The talks do not involve direct conversations between Malley and Iranian officials, as such a meeting was precluded by U.S. and Iranian demands that the other side relent first. “The team on the ground in Vienna has had consultations with our European allies as well as with our Russian and Chinese partners; they, in turn, have met with the Iranian delegation,” Price told reporters Wednesday. “We have heard more about Iran's position. Our partners have, in turn, heard from us more about our position, which they have then relayed to the Iranians. And, in short, this is what we had hoped to accomplish at the outset.” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani hailed the gathering as “a new success” for Tehran. “A single voice is heard today, which is everyone around the nuclear deal has come to the conclusion that there is no better solution than the JCPOA and no other way but the full implementation of the JCPOA,” he said. China’s envoy in Vienna insisted that Biden “lift all ... unlawful sanctions against Iran” in order to restore the nuclear deal while tapping the brakes on Blinken’s broader ambition. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER “The original intention of its negotiation is to address the Iranian nuclear issue rather than all regional security issues,” the Chinese ambassador told state media. “As for the relevant concern on regional security, it's imperative that it be separated and dealt with at a different platform vis-a-vis the JCPOA."

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 complementary.

The image shows State Department spokesperson Ned Price speaking at a press briefing. The news events set is about the relationship between the United States and China on the issue of Iran's nuclear program. Price is the State Department's spokesperson, and he is likely to be well-informed about the Biden administration's position on Iran. The image is complementary to the news events set because it provides a visual representation of one of the key players in the story.


News article:
A senior Chinese diplomat endorsed Iran’s negotiating position during a high-stakes meeting about the rehabilitation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, even as President Joe Biden hopes Beijing will be a “partner” in these negotiations. “This is a question involving the fundamental principle of rights and wrongs. As a victim, Iran's legitimate requirement should, in the first place, be affirmed and catered for,” Chinese Ambassador Wang Qun, the top Chinese diplomat to the United Nations in Vienna, told state media. “In order to break the current impasse, it is imperative that the U.S. return to the JCPOA at an early date by lifting all unlawful and unilateral sanctions.” Those comments align Chinese General Secretary Xi Jinping’s regime with Tehran’s hard-line posture, as Iranian officials pressure Biden to dismantle former President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” unilaterally. Biden’s team has denounced Trump’s policy but avoided lifting the sanctions, citing the need to ensure that Iran likewise returns to compliance with the deal while laying the groundwork for additional measures to restrain Iranian aggression — an initiative that U.S. officials hope will find support even among American rivals. “I think principally and strategically, this is an area where we do have aligned interests with Moscow and aligned interests with Beijing,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters Tuesday. “They have sought to uphold the JCPOA, and we do see them as partners in this fairly narrow effort.” US AIR FORCE B-52 BOMBERS FLY OVER MIDDLE EAST IN SHOW OF FORCE AS TENSIONS FLARE WITH IRAN That analysis misunderstands China’s position, according to Iran hawks skeptical of Biden’s approach to managing threats posed by the Gulf regime. Iran signed up for China’s Belt and Road Initiative last month, as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced a “permanent and strategic” partnership between Beijing and Tehran. “The Chinese see this as a zero-sum game: They see American power and prestige as a threat to the expansion of their influence, [which leads Beijing to the conclusion that] anything that puts the U.S. in a stronger geopolitical position is bad for China,” the Heritage Foundation’s James Carafano argued. Some members of the Trump administration shared Price’s perception of China’s posture earlier in their tenure, but that view was shaken by Beijing’s insistence on purchasing Iranian oil despite the threat of U.S. sanctions. “We literally offered the Chinese to replace Iranian oil, barrel for barrel, with the Saudis ... and they still pursued illicit means of importing Iranian crude,” a former Trump administration official said. That experience impelled a reassessment of China’s intentions. “They clearly see [Iran] as a potential client-state in the Middle East,” the former official said. “I think, in their mind, they actually believe the JCPOA limits Iran’s nuclear advancement and therefore is the de-escalation they need to prevent any war in the Middle East ... [but] it's not just about the oil supply. There is something more about being with non-U.S.-aligned power in the region. That’s not the U.S. position, despite Blinken’s support for the nuclear deal. “Our strategy sees the mutual return to the JCPOA as necessary but insufficient,” Price told reporters Wednesday. “We seek not only a longer and stronger deal, but over the longer term, working with partners in the region, follow-on agreements to address [Iranian human rights abuses, support for terrorism, and missile development].

News article:
Delicate talks to restore constraints on Iran's nuclear program began in Vienna on Tuesday between the United States and other leading countries. Their task is to undo the damage Donald Trump caused when he left an agreement that had effectively shrunk Iran's program, frozen it for a generation and put it under lock and camera. The talks to return to the nuclear deal will be tough. Neither side wants to be seen as weak or as giving in to the other. But early signs are encouraging. It should be possible to put the deal back together, but not if President Joe Biden listens to the siren song of junking that agreement for "a better deal." Biden was part of the process that produced the historic agreement in 2015 that blocked Iran's pathways to a nuclear bomb for the next decade. That plan — known by the complicated title the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA — won nearly universal praise from experts, military leaders, diplomats and former national security officials — including some Israeli military leaders. Under the deal, it would take Iran at least a year to assemble the material for a bomb. With the cameras, electronic monitoring devices and constant inspections mandated by the agreement, as well as U.S. and allied intelligence operations, we would be able to see Iran doing it. Plenty of time to act forcefully if necessary. But not everyone liked it. Those who wanted to overthrow the government of Iran, in particular, opposed any deal that would convey legitimacy on a government they detested. They and other critics claimed the deal didn't provide for adequate inspection of Iran's nuclear facilities while simply enabling Tehran to wait out the expiration of the deal's terms before it built a bomb down the road. These opponents included hawks in Congress, the leaders of Israel and Saudi Arabia and many of the supporters of the son of the former shah of Iran, who want to restore the monarchy that the Islamic revolutionaries overthrew in 1979. As Obama administration CIA Director John Brennan wrote recently in a Chicago Tribune op-ed, the "opposition was rooted in an eclectic mix of rigid ideological fervor, partisan politics and substantive ignorance of the agreement." This coalition, and the money and influence they exerted, helped persuade Trump to go back on America's word in 2018 and violate the agreement by reinstating all the sanctions that had been lifted, as well as adding more for a total of over 1500 Trump-imposed sanctions. He said his program of maximum pressure would force Iran to agree to a "better deal" or collapse. Neither happened. We are now in worse shape, as Iran has steadily moved away from the deal, increasing its nuclear activities and its influence in the region through proxies, allies and its ability to take advantage of the chaos triggered by the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Once again, Iran could be mere weeks away from having enough uranium for a bomb. Once again, we are threatened with a stark choice. The Los Angeles Times reports that some Pentagon sources think the tensions in the region are so severe that without a deal, "the choice becomes to watch Iran march closer to the ability to build a bomb, or to go to war to stop it." Opponents of talks with Iran know that "Bomb, Bomb, Bomb Iran" is not a convincing slogan. So they have come up with a more appealing one: A Better Deal. They want to persuade Americans to abandon a deal that is working, like Aesop's greedy dog with a bone in his mouth, who, seeing his reflection in the water, drops what he has to grab what he thinks is a bigger bone. Hawkish Sens. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., last month led a group of 41 senators proposing just such a course. They pushed for a comprehensive agreement "that prevents Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons" but also "meaningfully constrains its destabilizing activity throughout the Middle East and its ballistic missile program" and frees U.S. citizens held in Iranian prisons while preventing "attacks on important U.S. security partners." All laudable goals. But achieving those in one grand bargain is like hunting unicorns. Such a deal is simply impossible. It is not just the error of making the better the enemy of the good. It is cynically exploiting inherent American optimism and can-do spirit to prevent reconciliation with a government they oppose. In September 2013, I had dinner in New York with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and a small group of experts and thought leaders just before the first set of talks on the original Iran nuclear deal began. We pressed him about the idea of a grand bargain. "The history between Iran and the U.S. is long and complicated," he said. "The table will not bear the weight of all these issues at once. That is why we have decided to tackle the nuclear issue first." He saw the nuclear deal as a "gateway opportunity." So, too, did the Obama administration. Indeed, if we could resolve this most critical issue, it could provide the foundation to resolve the others. Thankfully, this is the approach favored by the White House. "The Biden-Harris administration hopes to get Iran back in compliance with the deal. Then we would be in compliance with the deal," Wendy Sherman, Biden's nominee for deputy secretary of state, told the Senate at her confirmation hearing. "We would build from that to get a longer and stronger agreement ... then address other issues of concern." This approach does not ignore the other crucial issues. It simply prioritizes them. Every other issue we have with Iran is much more difficult to resolve if Iran has nuclear weapons. While we care deeply about our regional allies, human rights in Iran and American prisoners, we must prioritize threats to the U.S. itself. A nuclear Iran is an existential danger. So is the nuclear arms race in the Middle East that Iran could trigger if Saudi Arabia, Turkey and others try to match its capabilities. The Vienna talks may be our last chance to restore the deal. The clock is ticking. Presidential elections set for June in Iran will soon make it impossible for the current government to negotiate, because hard-line opponents of Rouhani do not want him and his more pragmatic political allies to get credit for coming back to the deal. Some do not want any deal. In this way, Iranian politics mirror those in the U.S., with fierce partisan politics trumping national security interests. While we care deeply about our regional allies, human rights in Iran and American prisoners, we must prioritize threats to the United States itself. A nuclear Iran is an existential danger. The talks to return to the nuclear deal will be tough. Neither side wants to be seen as weak or as giving in to the other. But early signs are encouraging. The countries agreed Tuesday to stay through the week, establishing working groups to detail precisely how Iran and the U.S. would synchronize their return to compliance. The key will be to move quickly. Although Biden has a large, ambitious domestic agenda, this is not an issue he can put on the shelf and pick up in September. There are too many in both capitals and the Middle East who want to kill the deal and too many conflicts that could erupt into full-scale war. Biden cannot chase unicorns. He must move adroitly to resolve a foreign policy issue that could sink his presidency if it heads to a violent, unnecessary war.

In September 2013, I had dinner in New York with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and a small group of experts and thought leaders just before the first set of talks on the original Iran nuclear deal began. We pressed him about the idea of a grand bargain. "The history between Iran and the U.S. is long and complicated," he said. "The table will not bear the weight of all these issues at once. That is why we have decided to tackle the nuclear issue first." He saw the nuclear deal as a "gateway opportunity." So, too, did the Obama administration. Indeed, if we could resolve this most critical issue, it could provide the foundation to resolve the others. Thankfully, this is the approach favored by the White House. "The Biden-Harris administration hopes to get Iran back in compliance with the deal. Then we would be in compliance with the deal," Wendy Sherman, Biden's nominee for deputy secretary of state, told the Senate at her confirmation hearing. "We would build from that to get a longer and stronger agreement ... then address other issues of concern." This approach does not ignore the other crucial issues. It simply prioritizes them. Every other issue we have with Iran is much more difficult to resolve if Iran has nuclear weapons. While we care deeply about our regional allies, human rights in Iran and American prisoners, we must prioritize threats to the U.S. itself. A nuclear Iran is an existential danger. So is the nuclear arms race in the Middle East that Iran could trigger if Saudi Arabia, Turkey and others try to match its capabilities. The Vienna talks may be our last chance to restore the deal. The clock is ticking. Presidential elections set for June in Iran will soon make it impossible for the current government to negotiate, because hard-line opponents of Rouhani do not want him and his more pragmatic political allies to get credit for coming back to the deal. Some do not want any deal. In this way, Iranian politics mirror those in the U.S., with fierce partisan politics trumping national security interests. While we care deeply about our regional allies, human rights in Iran and American prisoners, we must prioritize threats to the United States itself. A nuclear Iran is an existential danger. The talks to return to the nuclear deal will be tough. Neither side wants to be seen as weak or as giving in to the other. But early signs are encouraging. The countries agreed Tuesday to stay through the week, establishing working groups to detail precisely how Iran and the U.S. would synchronize their return to compliance. The key will be to move quickly. Although Biden has a large, ambitious domestic agenda, this is not an issue he can put on the shelf and pick up in September. There are too many in both capitals and the Middle East who want to kill the deal and too many conflicts that could erupt into full-scale war. Biden cannot chase unicorns. He must move adroitly to resolve a foreign policy issue that could sink his presidency if it heads to a violent, unnecessary war.

EXCLUSIVE: More than 300 Iranian-American activists on Wednesday wrote to President Biden urging him to support a democratic and secular Iran, and not to ease sanctions until the regime in Tehran ends human rights abuses -- as negotiations on reviving the Iran deal begin. "Your administration’s impactful actions must be directed towards blocking the Iranian regime’s violation of human rights, and their export of terrorism in the region and beyond," the letter from more than 300 American-Iranians, including physicians, engineers and professors, says. "As you craft your policy, defending human rights and democracy in Iran should be the central and enduring element of your policy on Iran." US, IRAN DUE TO BEGIN INDIRECT NUCLEAR TALKS IN VIENNA The letter is part of a continued effort from pro-democracy Iranian dissidents and groups, who call for a democratic, secular and non-nuclear Iran, to urge the Biden administration to keep up the pressure on the regime, which was dialed up during the Trump administration. The Trump-era White House adopted a "maximum pressure" strategy against the regime, reimposing sanctions and withdrawing the U.S. from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- known as the Iran nuclear deal. POMPEO SAYS BIDEN MOVES ON IRAN, HOUTHIS PRECURSORS TO RE-ENTERING 'CRAZY, CRAPPY' NUCLEAR DEAL Biden has indicated he wishes to re-enter the U.S. into the agreement, and his administration has abandoned a push at the United Nations to "snapback" U.N. sanctions -- including an expired arms embargo -- on the country. However, Biden has also indicated that sanctions relief will not happen until Iran is also back in the nuclear agreement -- seemingly ruling out sanctions relief as a precursor to negotiations. The signers of the letter say they are "encouraged" by that pledge, but warn of what they say is a "fable" that there is a moderate faction inside the regime that can be given power. "After trying to years to find such an elusive faction, the world has realized that the Iranian regime in its totality is an unchangeable dictatorship that cannot give birth to a less repressive government," it says. The letter calls on Biden to develop a roadmap and policies that "side with the Iranian people and their legitimate desire for a free, secular and democratic Iran, and will end the Iranian regime’s malign and dangerous expansion of its terrorism in the world, and funneling Iranian people’s resources to fund extremists in the region, as Iranians chant ‘leave Syria alone, think about us.'" "Furthermore, no sanctions relief or concessions should be provided to the Iranian regime, unless that regime verifiably ends its human rights abuses in iran and terrorism abroad, and abandons its destructive support for proxies in the region," it says. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The letter comes after envoys from Russia, China, Germany, France, Britain and Iran met in Vienna, and as the U.S. was due to start its own indirect talks with Iran -- as part of a global effort to bring both Iran and the U.S. back to the Iran deal. Professor Kazem Kazerounian, one of the lead organizers of the letter, noted that the talks in Iran are going on in Vienna, where a potential terrorist plot against the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) in Paris was planned. He said that many of the co-signers of the letter were also targets of the 2018 plot. "The signatories know the terrorism of the Iranian regime firsthand," he said. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Biden’s new Iran Deal must rein in Tehran’s proxies Dr. Azeem Ibrahim Joe Biden will lift sanctions on Iran that are inconsistent with the Iran deal. (Getty Images) Short Url https://arab.news/zcqy6 President Joe Biden has announced that he is preparing to lift sanctions on Iran inconsistent with the Iran deal. There is no doubt the Obama administration’s Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), colloquially called the “Iran Deal,” was a great achievement of diplomacy; decades after the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979, Washington, London, Tehran and others managed to come together and agree to an international treaty. Nevertheless, the JCPOA was critically flawed, in a way that made it unsustainable from the outset: It may have successfully contained Iran’s nuclear capacity, but left Tehran free rein to attack other US interests and allies in the Middle East through its long-established, extensive network of proxies dedicated to that goal. Iran funds, arms, trains, and helps direct many factions, such as the Assad government in Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Palestinian occupied territories, the Houthis in Yemen, and in recent years even the Afghan Taliban. On top of that, Iran has sustained a number of smaller terrorist groups and cells that have carried out attacks against US diplomatic and military assets for decades. Read the full report on Arab News Research & Studies here. A Democrat-led Washington could wear those excesses and fight that fight in isolation of the JCPOA. But any Iran hawk could later come in and use the activities of those proxies against American interests in the region as a pretext to sink the JCPOA and set the US on the path of direct military confrontation with Tehran. And Washington certainly has no shortage of figures keen to do just that. So yes, it is imperative that Biden resurrects the “Iran Deal” to make sure Tehran does not acquire nuclear weapons. The only other way to potentially stop it from achieving that goal is war, which, in the aftermath of Iraq, should obviously be avoided. Iran is a much bigger and more powerful country than Iraq was, and among the people of Iran, even those who loathe the government would hate Western intervention even more, and would rally against invading forces. That is to say nothing of the fact that Iran has close economic and strategic ties to both Russia and China, who would aid Tehran’s efforts to defend itself. Conflict is not only a morally wrong course of action: It would be ruinous for America’s interests. Washington may not lose the war, but they would likely lose the peace. But if war is to be avoided during this and subsequent administrations, treaties between the US and Iran to guarantee peace need to be politically sustainable. Future US presidents must not have easy pretexts to rescind the agreements and re-initiate hostilities. That primarily means Tehran must be constrained from continuing its proxy war against the US in the Middle East. Iran funds, arms, trains, and helps direct many factions, such as the Assad government in Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Palestinian occupied territories, the Houthis in Yemen, and in recent years even the Afghan Taliban. Dr. Azeem Ibrahim Of course, this works both ways. Tehran is also replete with anti-American hawks, and their own nationalist conservatives have strong political incentives to undermine any détente with the US and instigate direct confrontation. For this reason, Washington must also make concessions. Above all, it must publicly acknowledge that it was former President Donald Trump who reneged on the JCPOA first, that Tehran complied with the agreement itself despite its malign activities in the region, and that the people of Iran perhaps deserve some compensation for the economic hardship following the reimposition of sanctions by Trump. Read the full report on Arab News Research & Studies here. All those things are true, and recognising them as such must be the foundation of any good faith effort to rebuild the nuclear agreement. But in exchange for that good faith, it should be demanded of Iran that it respond with equal good faith and stop funding every proxy and terrorist group opposed to the US in the region. An agreement must be reached, because failure is almost certain to lead to a war with no winners: Both sides will lose status, money, power and the lives of their soldiers, and millions of innocent people caught in the middle will suffer and die needlessly. That is a scenario no one can afford. Dr. Azeem Ibrahim is a director at the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy in Washington DC.

News article:
President Joe Biden’s administration is “utterly senseless” to seek any new restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program or military apparatus, according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “The way we see it, it is utterly senseless to demand Iran should accept new conditions within the framework of the nuclear deal or assume new obligations apart from the JCPOA,” Lavrov said, using the acronym for the 2015 nuclear deal, according to state media. Those remarks were just one in a series of comments aligning Russia with Tehran’s negotiating position, with the opening round of talks over the U.S. and Iranian return to compliance underway in Vienna. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s team assesses that Russia and China share the Western interest in constraining Iran’s nuclear program, but U.S. intelligence officials also perceive Russian officials as eager to damage most U.S. policy initiatives. “Moscow will continue to employ a variety of tactics this year meant to undermine US influence, develop new international norms and partnerships, divide Western countries and weaken Western alliances, and demonstrate Russia’s ability to shape global events as a major player in a new multipolar international order,” a new report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence states. IRAN TO ENRICH URANIUM AT HIGHEST-EVER LEVELS AFTER NATANZ ATTACK Lavrov portrayed Biden’s current maintenance of the sanctions imposed by former President Donald Trump as a self-serving policy by the U.S. government. “The main problem, as we see it, is Washington's persistent unwillingness to abandon its flawed course towards upholding the U.S.'s global dominance,” he told Iranian media, claiming the United States and European government had embarked upon a “neocolonial” foreign policy. “This is, of course, unacceptable for both Russia and Iran, as well as most countries of the world.” Iranian officials want Biden to lift all sanctions imposed by Trump — not only the nuclear sanctions renewed when he exited the 2015 deal but also the terrorism-related sanctions. U.S. officials so far have signaled they will refuse to do so. Russia’s position is “clear and consistent with our Iranian friends’ approach,” Lavrov stated. “All unilateral sanctions imposed by Washington in direct violation of the JCPOA must, of course, be lifted,” he said. “This topic is being discussed in Vienna.” American negotiators in Vienna, however, have emphasized that Iran’s demand is too expansive because Tehran is trying to pressure Biden to lift terrorism sanctions, in addition to the nuclear-related measures. “Under the deal, the U.S. retains the right to impose sanctions for nonnuclear reasons, whether it’s terrorism or human rights violations or interference with our elections, etc.,” a senior State Department official told reporters on Friday. “Our view is that all sanctions that are inconsistent with the JCPOA and inconsistent with the benefits that Iran expects from the JCPOA, we are prepared to lift those if Iran comes back into compliance with its obligations.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Lavrov condemned the European Union’s decision this week to sanction Iranian security officials involved in a violent crackdown on protests that took place in 2019. “If the decision was made deliberately, in the midst of the ongoing talks in Vienna on ways to rescue the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, then this is not a disaster,” he said. "It is the kind of mistake that, as you know, is worse than a crime.”

President Joe Biden’s administration is “utterly senseless” to seek any new restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program or military apparatus, according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “The way we see it, it is utterly senseless to demand Iran should accept new conditions within the framework of the nuclear deal or assume new obligations apart from the JCPOA,” Lavrov said, using the acronym for the 2015 nuclear deal, according to state media. Those remarks were just one in a series of comments aligning Russia with Tehran’s negotiating position, with the opening round of talks over the U.S. and Iranian return to compliance underway in Vienna.

News article:
The Biden administration is appeasing Iran with words and deeds. It's a serious error of judgment. The Trump administration’s maximum pressure campaign against Iran was effective in denying the regime the funds it needs to support its proxies, including Hezbollah in Syria and Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Those sanctions have also put Iran's economy on the brink of collapse. Unfortunately, instead of using this leverage, the Biden administration has squandered it. In February, President Joe Biden removed the Houthis from the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations. The administration cited humanitarian assistance reasons for doing so, but the decision just doesn't add up. The Houthis conduct terrorism in Yemen and attempt to export terrorism with ballistic missile attacks on population centers in Saudi Arabia. But the nuclear deal issue is the big concern. On the campaign trail, Biden pledged that the United States would not return to the nuclear deal unless Iran first returned to compliance with it. Biden added that he would also seek to address nonnuclear issues, including the regime’s malign regional activities, ballistic missile program, and human rights violations. Instead, the Biden administration and Iran have agreed to establish two working groups on how both parties can reenter the deal. This clearly breaks Biden’s pledge from the campaign trail. Instead of waiting for Iran to return to the deal, Biden is showing himself desperate to return to a policy of dangerous failure. How else can we consider the 2015 arrangement that gave the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism $150 billion in sanctions relief while failing to address the regime’s regional aggression, ballistic missile program, human rights violations, and covert nuclear weapons research? If the U.S. returns to the nuclear deal and lifts sanctions on Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei won't exactly be ready to reconsider his other destabilizing activities. On the contrary, he'll have the political rationale and treasury investments to double down on those activities. Jackson Richman was most recently the Washington correspondent for JNS.org.

This image is not directly related to the specific events mentioned in the news article, such as the Biden administration's decision to remove the Houthis from the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations or the negotiations to revive the Iran nuclear deal. However, the image does capture the overall theme of the article, which is critical of the Biden administration's approach to Iran. The image suggests that Biden is feeling down or concerned about the situation, which is consistent with the tone of the article.

News article:
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei strongly criticized efforts of President Joe Biden's administration and European leaders to return the Persian Gulf nation to its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal, slamming the "false words" of the United States. The 2015 agreement—officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—is a treaty that promises Iran sanctions relief and international investment in exchange for the nation curbing its nuclear program. Former President Barack Obama's administration pushed through the accord alongside leaders from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the European Union, Russia and China, but former President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimplemented harsh sanctions against Iran. Biden's administration is now working to restore the international pact and bring Iran back into compliance. But Khamenei signaled Wednesday that Iran was not willing to compromise its position. "The US is not after accepting the truth through #negotiations. Rather, it seeks to impose its false words. The Europeans have also confessed in some private meetings with our officials that #Iran is in the right, & they acknowledge our policy that sanctions must be removed first," Khamenei wrote in a series of Twitter posts. The US is not after accepting the truth through #negotiations. Rather, it seeks to impose its false words. The Europeans have also confessed in some private meetings with our officials that #Iran is in the right, & they acknowledge our policy that sanctions must be removed first. — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) April 14, 2021 Taking aim at Europe and the U.S., he said the "suggestions they make are often arrogant and degrading, thus they aren't even worth looking at." Khamenei called the U.S. an "aggressor" and said Europeans "follow the U.S. because they don't have any true independence." Nevertheless, when it comes to making decisions, the same Europeans follow the U.S. Because they don’t have any true independence and the U.S. is an aggressor too. The suggestions they make are often arrogant and degrading, thus they aren’t even worth looking at. — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) April 14, 2021 At the same time, Khamenei suggested Iran would be willing to return to the agreement if its demands are met. He expressed a desire for Iran's negotiators to "enjoy divine success." "We have already declared #Iran's policy. #Sanctions must be removed first. Once we are certain that has been done, we will carry out our commitments. This is because they have broken their promises tens of times, and it is the same now," the Iranian leader wrote. We have already declared #Iran's policy. #Sanctions must be removed first. Once we are certain that has been done, we will carry out our commitments. This is because they have broken their promises tens of times, and it is the same now. — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) April 14, 2021 A State Department spokesperson told Newsweek in an email that Iran and the U.S. share "a common objective" to restore the JCPOA. "The United States and Iran have stated a common objective of returning to mutual compliance with the JCPOA. We have been engaged constructively in a diplomatic process to achieve that goal," the spokesperson said. "In Vienna last week, we explored concrete approaches concerning the steps both Iran and the U.S. would need to take to return to compliance. The U.S. delegation is in Vienna this week for the resumption of talks and the working groups in order to discuss a possible mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA." After Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reimplemented harsh sanctions, Iranian leaders repeatedly negotiated with European leaders, as well as Russia and China, to preserve the JCPOA. A year after the Trump administration walked away from U.S. commitments, Iran announced that it would begin enriching uranium and stop abiding by its commitments under the international agreement. Meanwhile, European leaders, Russia and China repeatedly expressed their displeasure with the Trump administration's policy toward Iran. During his campaign, Biden—who served as vice president when Obama signed the agreement—said he would work on returning to the international accord and indirect talks have moved forward with European leaders. Although Iranian officials have shown a willingness to talk, one of the negotiators said this week that Iran would begin enriching uranium up to 60 percent purity, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday. The country had already been enriching uranium up to 20 percent. Updated 10:57 AM ET, with comment from the State Department.

In early April, Iran celebrated its 15th annual “National Nuclear Technology Day” and used the occasion to demonstrate new IR-9 centrifuges. These new centrifuges are 50 times more efficient enriching uranium than the previous model. This achievement is a thumb-in-the-eye to America proving Iran’s “peaceful nuclear program” is anything but…and that they will continue their deceptive march to become a nuclear power. Consider how the confluence of three developments forms a “perfect storm” endangering Israel, the United States and world peace. First, how can it be that America is now an impotent paper tiger in spite of fielding a world class military, controlling powerful financial networks and being the dominant world economic force? The answer to this absurdity has to lie with President Biden’s early messaging to Iran. He appears willing to forego leverage of crippling sanctions, to subtly undermine support for Sunni nations and to re-enter the flawed 2015 JCPOA. Joe Biden has chosen senior leaders who have demonstrated anti-Israel bias. In addition to the JCPOA facilitators like John Kerry, Wendy Sherman and Tony Blinken, consider the damage done by selection of Rob Malley, Maher Bitar, Kristen Clarke and Matt Duss. What does this tell Iran? Biden’s first three months in office have witnessed Georgia voting law “outrage” earning from the Washington Post four Pinocchios, a border “crisis” coverup, the sleight-of-hand Covid Relief Bill targeted expenditures, an Infrastructure Bill with its loosey-goosey definitions, and whitewashing strung-out Hunter’s mischief. While all this hypocrisy should horrify Americans, it also conveys to our enemies a willful, foolish disrespect for the truth…and it undermines Biden’s credibility among sovereign leaders. “False words are not only evil in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil,” warned Plato. From the warp-speed Covid vaccine development to border security to the progress in the Middle East, Biden has petulantly pursued an anti-Trump doctrine. He wants to erase the very real progress made by his predecessor. Joe Biden’s missing-in-action presidency highlighted with a bunkered public schedule and opaque, teleprompter “transparency” telegraphs to our adversaries that either others are in charge or that he lacks the energy to lead our country. Second, Iran has to feel empowered. While there is a proxy-cold war fought with Israel…witness the attacks in Syria, Natanz sabotage, and against shipping vessels…their $400 billion trade deal with China and outreach by the EU have to inspire Iranian resolve. Biden’s prolific use of Executive Orders suggests a strategy to short circuit legislative processes, including Congressional approval. Secretary of Defense Austin recently pledged America’s commitment to Israel’s security. Great, but we all recall President Obama’s breathless pledge to “…have Israel back” and we witnessed his UN Resolution 2334 treachery. Advertisement Recent reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) detailing new Iranian nuclear breaches and the Mossad’s 2018 lift of half a ton of archived documents from a Teheran warehouse substantiated the reality of their decades’ long pursuit of a nuclear weapon. To treat the Iranians and their negotiators as anything but untrustworthy adversaries is a fool’s mission. Iran is a determined foe bent on another Holocaust. Third, will the broader Jewish community pressure the Biden Administration to support Israel against the Iranian menace? The highly partisan, spiteful never-Trump obsession of the Jewish voting public is backstopped with compliant politicized “Jewish” organizations. The tilt of major American Jewish organizations like ADL, HIAS, National Council of Jewish Women and even the JCPA away from their roots is a crystal-clear signal something is VERY wrong. It would seem our Jewish leadership has forgotten our vulnerability, and hyper partisanship distracts them from lessons of the past. The infection of false words has proven fatal for the Jews, and these organizations now cave to “feelings” of the woke-cancel-intersectional narratives that convert Israel into the aggressor, colonialist and racist. The hard work to teach, understand and advocate for the truthful “facts” is inconvenient and not fashionable. If Iran succeeds in manufacturing a nuclear weapon it won’t simply end there. It will be like the spoiled child who had to have a toy or a candy — something else will be demanded. Their malign behavior will continue and their desire for a Shia hegemony will remain front and center. Other Sunni nations will then seek similar armaments. And Israel’s Begin Doctrine of not permitting a weapon of mass destruction will be tested. Advertisement Consistent with their shrill proclamations, a nuclear Iran will try to destroy Israel, and destabilize the region. Biden’s rush to reset Obama’s appeasement will make the Middle East exponentially more volatile and have a draconian economic effect on a Covid recovering world. Some American Jewish leaders already demonstrate preference for appeasement, and the recent Georgia Congressional elections have removed important counterbalances. Are leaders of Jewish organizations aware of the existential threat and do they have the courage and foresight to stand tall to apply their voice and influence? Mitigating this “perfect storm” must transcend all other mandates and missions.

https://www.frontpagemag.com/point/2021/04/dem-senator-who-secretly-met-iran-minister-demands-daniel-greenfield/ Iran Firsters are a problem. They’re an even bigger problem when they’re running the government. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), hoping to quell speculation of wrongdoing, has formally responded to reports that he held a secret meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif last week. But his explanation may raise more questions than it answers. The Federalist first reported Monday that Murphy and other Democratic senators held a “secret” meeting with Zarif last week at the annual Munich Security Conference. The news immediately began to circulate in the media and led to speculation as to whether Murphy had undermined U.S. foreign policy or even potentially violated the Logan Act by holding the meeting. Tuesday morning, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo commented on the reports, seeming to scold Murphy and his Democratic colleagues for meeting with Zarif, who, Pompeo noted, is “the foreign minister of a country that killed an American on December 27” and “is the largest world sponsor of terror and the world’s largest sponsor of anti-Semitism.” Pompeo also noted Zarif’s status. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responded to the news of the meeting. “This guy [Zarif] is designated by the United States of America,” Pompeo said at a press conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. “He’s the foreign minister for a country that shot down a commercial airliner and has yet to turn over the black boxes. This is the foreign minister of a country that killed an American on December 27. And it’s the foreign minister of a country who is the largest world sponsor of terror and the world’s largest sponsor of anti-Semitism.” Pompeo referred to the US treasury decision in July 2019 to designate Zarif for acting for the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei. In April 2019, US President Donald Trump designated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and its Quds Force, as a foreign terrorist organization. After an alleged Israeli attack crippled thousands of centrifuges at Iran’s Natanz plant, Iran Firsters have been fuming. The alleged Israeli attack on Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility targeted an electrical substation located 40 to 50 meters underground and damaged “thousands of centrifuges,” Iranian officials revealed in recent days. Fereydoon Abbasi-Davani, former head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, told Iranian media on Monday that the attack hit an electrical substation located deep underground and managed to damage both the power distribution system and the cable leading to the centrifuges in order to cut power to them. The Iranian official stressed that such an operation takes years, saying “the design of the enemy was very beautiful.” Now, Senator Murphy is demanding a “classified briefing on the Natanz incident” while ranting that, “there is no viable military path to divorcing Iran from a nuclear weapon.” This was also Murphy’s response to the assassination of Iran’s nuclear chief Fakhrizadeh. Senator Murphy has been backed by the Iran Lobby and appeared at its events. I would say that he’s the last person who should have a classified briefing about actions against Iran. But he’s actually the next to last after Iran’s biggest ally in the Senate. That would be Joe Biden.

News article:
[1/3] Head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization Ali-Akbar Salehi wears a mask as he speaks during a meeting with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi, in Tehran, Iran February 21, 2021. Hadi Zand/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY. April 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday called Iran's enrichment of uranium to 60% purity unhelpful but said he is pleased Tehran is still in indirect talks with Washington about both countries resuming compliance with the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal. Iran on Friday said it had begun enriching uranium to 60%, its highest level ever and a step closer to the 90% that is weapons grade, at its Natanz plant, where an explosion occurred earlier this week that Tehran blamed on Israel. "We do not support and do not think it's at all helpful that Iran is saying it's going to move to enrich to 60 percent," Biden told reporters in Washington during a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. "We are, though, nonetheless pleased that Iran has continued to agree to engage in discussions - indirect discussions - with us and with our partners on how we move forward and what is needed to allow us to move back into the (nuclear deal) ... without us making concessions that we are just not willing to make," Biden added. Iran had in recent months already raised enrichment to 20% purity, a level at which uranium is considered to be highly enriched and a significant step toward weapons-grade. A 2015 deal with world powers to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions in return for the lifting of sanctions had capped the level of purity at 3.67%. Iran denies seeking a nuclear weapon. "We are producing about 9 grams of 60% enriched uranium an hour," Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told state television. "But we have to work on arrangements ... to drop it to 5 grams per hour. But then we will simultaneously produce 20% (uranium)," Salehi said. Earlier, Iran's parliament speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said Iranian scientists had successfully started enriching 60% uranium at 40 minutes past midnight. "The will of the Iranian nation makes miracles that thwart any conspiracy," Qalibaf wrote on Twitter. In Vienna, a spokesman for the United Nations nuclear watchdog IAEA declined to comment on the Iranian statements about 60% enrichment. Asked if Iran's move was a sign that Tehran is not serious about returning to the nuclear deal, Biden replied: "The discussions are under way. I think it's premature to make a judgment as to what the outcome will be. But we are still talking." Iran and global powers are meeting in Vienna to try to rescue the 2015 nuclear deal abandoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump three years ago - an effort potentially complicated by Tehran's decision to ramp up uranium enrichment. The talks will carry on for several days before breaking so that Iranian and U.S. officials can return home for consultations, a European Union official said on Friday. read more "We have this (Iranian) decision to go for 60% enrichment. Obviously this is not making the negotiation easier," the EU official told reporters, calling what happened at Natanz "deliberate sabotage". Abbas Araqchi, Iran's chief negotiator at the talks, said on Tuesday that Iran would activate 1,000 advanced centrifuge machines at Natanz. Multiple Israeli media outlets have quoted unnamed intelligence sources as saying the country's Mossad spy service carried out the sabotage operation at the Natanz complex. Israel - widely believed to be the only Middle Eastern country with a nuclear arsenal - has not formally commented on the incident. Israel will do "whatever it takes" to ensure that Iran does not acquire nuclear weapons, Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said on Friday. read more dubai.newsroom@thomsonreuters.com Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Iran on Friday said it had begun enriching uranium to 60%, its highest level ever and a step closer to the 90% that is weapons grade, at its Natanz plant, where an explosion occurred earlier this week that Tehran blamed on Israel. "We do not support and do not think it's at all helpful that Iran is saying it's going to move to enrich to 60 percent," Biden told reporters in Washington during a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. "We are, though, nonetheless pleased that Iran has continued to agree to engage in discussions - indirect discussions - with us and with our partners on how we move forward and what is needed to allow us to move back into the (nuclear deal) ... without us making concessions that we are just not willing to make," Biden added. Iran had in recent months already raised enrichment to 20% purity, a level at which uranium is considered to be highly enriched and a significant step toward weapons-grade. A 2015 deal with world powers to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions in return for the lifting of sanctions had capped the level of purity at 3.67%. Iran denies seeking a nuclear weapon. "We are producing about 9 grams of 60% enriched uranium an hour," Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told state television. "But we have to work on arrangements ... to drop it to 5 grams per hour. But then we will simultaneously produce 20% (uranium)," Salehi said. Earlier, Iran's parliament speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said Iranian scientists had successfully started enriching 60% uranium at 40 minutes past midnight. "The will of the Iranian nation makes miracles that thwart any conspiracy," Qalibaf wrote on Twitter. In Vienna, a spokesman for the United Nations nuclear watchdog IAEA declined to comment on the Iranian statements about 60% enrichment. Asked if Iran's move was a sign that Tehran is not serious about returning to the nuclear deal, Biden replied: "The discussions are under way. I think it's premature to make a judgment as to what the outcome will be. But we are still talking." Iran and global powers are meeting in Vienna to try to rescue the 2015 nuclear deal abandoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump three years ago - an effort potentially complicated by Tehran's decision to ramp up uranium enrichment. The talks will carry on for several days before breaking so that Iranian and U.S. officials can return home for consultations, a European Union official said on Friday. read more "We have this (Iranian) decision to go for 60% enrichment. Obviously this is not making the negotiation easier," the EU official told reporters, calling what happened at Natanz "deliberate sabotage". Abbas Araqchi, Iran's chief negotiator at the talks, said on Tuesday that Iran would activate 1,000 advanced centrifuge machines at Natanz. Multiple Israeli media outlets have quoted unnamed intelligence sources as saying the country's Mossad spy service carried out the sabotage operation at the Natanz complex. Israel - widely believed to be the only Middle Eastern country with a nuclear arsenal - has not formally commented on the incident. Israel will do "whatever it takes" to ensure that Iran does not acquire nuclear weapons, Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said on Friday. read more dubai.newsroom@thomsonreuters.com Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

News article:
Washington - Ali Barada US President Joe Biden has stressed that “it’s premature” to know whether the indirect talks between the US and Iran will result in mutual compliance with the nuclear deal. However, he stressed that he has no intention of “making concessions.” “We do not support and do not think it’s at all helpful that Iran is saying it’s going to move to enrich to 60 percent,” Biden said during a joint press conference with Prime Minister of Japan Yoshihide Suga in Washington. He added, “it is contrary to the agreement.” “We are, though, nonetheless pleased that Iran has continued to agree to engage in discussions — in direct discussions with us and with our — our partners on how we move forward and what is needed to allow us to move back into the JOPCA, and so that we are a part of it again — that we should have never gotten out of, in my view — without us making concessions that I’m — we’re just not willing to make.” “And so the discussions are underway. I think it’s premature to make a judgement as to what the outcome will be, but we’re still talking,” he stressed. American officials hinted that the new US Envoy to Iran, Robert Malley, expressed readiness to lift 700 sanctions of 1,500 sanctions imposed by the former US administration. However, these leaks weren’t confirmed by officials responsible for negotiations with Iran. Biden sees that Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign has failed. “We take seriously Iran’s provocative announcement of its intention to begin enriching uranium to 60 percent, which the P5+1 should be unified in rejecting,” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. She added that “this step both calls into question Iran’s seriousness with regard to the nuclear talks and underscores the imperative of returning to mutual compliance.” Commenting on the Vienna Talks, Psaki reiterated that they are going “to be difficult, to be long, we still feel that they are a step forward in moving towards — you know, leading with diplomacy to find a path forward."

News article:
Vienna is bustling with another round of diplomacy on the Iran nuclear file. Unlike the direct talks that resulted in the flawed 2015 Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), this time the American and Iranian sides are not engaging directly. No matter the format, the end result is hard to escape: another bad deal. A diplomatic collapse is coming, based on a familiar but wrongheaded negotiating approach by American diplomats. This coming collapse is not hard to understand. The Biden administration is imploring the Islamic Republic of Iran to return to compliance with the JCPOA—and the regime's talented negotiating team is playing hard to get. The talks revolve primarily around what the West should pay the world's most prolific state sponsor of terrorism for the privilege of re-entering a faulty nuclear agreement that in 2015 granted Iran everything it wanted—namely, a patient pathway to atomic weapons and massive economic relief. Nuclear diplomacy is fine, but it must be shaped by American leverage. That leverage is strong right now, with Iran's accessible foreign exchange reserves down from over $120 billion in 2018 to just $4 billion. The Iranian government is running on fumes and facing an economic crisis. To make matters worse for the clerical regime, the main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz was reportedly set back by around nine months because of an explosion earlier this month. Its nuclear weaponization ambitions were also delayed significantly by the assassination last November of the longtime head of its military-nuclear program, Mohsen Fahkrizadeh. Finally, the regime is still struggling to regain its footing regionally after the Trump administration in January 2020 took out the Islamic Republic's most talented battlefield commander, Qassem Suleimani. All of this is leverage for Washington. And that leverage can be further enhanced by building a credible military threat to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities if the mullahs move to a bomb. The Biden team says it seeks a "longer, stronger, broader" deal. But this is not possible unless the White House sets forth a new Iran policy that is not held hostage by the JCPOA. A rapid return to the old agreement—or even worse, an incremental return—cedes crucial leverage to Tehran. Such an approach gives the regime zero incentive to negotiate another deal. The Iranian strategy is clear: wield the threat of nuclear escalation to extort massive economic concessions in the form of American sanction relief and a return to the JCPOA. This will give the regime tens of billions of dollars and allow it to forge ahead on nuclear R&D (sadly, the regime's advances are based on knowledge and production capabilities they gained by violating the 2015 agreement). By returning to the JCPOA, the regime can legally install advanced centrifuges, build up their enrichment capabilities and wait for key restrictions to sunset over the next two to nine years. After 2030, there will be no prohibitions on the Islamic Republic's ability to enrich massive uranium quantities to weapon-grade. The regime is currently enriching uranium at 60 percent and threatening to go up to 90 percent and quickly moving toward industrial-scale production capabilities—including second- and third-generation centrifuges that are more efficient in uranium enrichment. Some of these machines were already installed underground at Natanz. The explosion at Natanz and the July 2020 destruction of an advanced centrifuge assembly facility did significant damage. But these actions will only temporarily set back Tehran's nuclear ambitions. The Islamic Republic can now produce advanced centrifuges in large quantities. Overall, the regime can enrich uranium three to ten times faster, to all levels, and in clandestine facilities. It's game, set, match unless the Biden administration pushes for a new deal that requires Tehran to fully account for its military-nuclear activities—now known to the world because of the Iran Nuclear Archive that Israel's Mossad spirited out of Iran in 2018. The Iranian violations are even worse in light of the recent and detailed findings of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that the clerical regime has been hiding undisclosed nuclear materials. In short, the IAEA's 2015 decision—pushed by then-Secretary of State John Kerry—to close its investigation into the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program was a serious mistake. The Archive findings and the IAEA's discoveries from its visits of Iranian nuclear sites demonstrated that the Islamic Republic was much closer to weaponization than was previously believed. The IAEA's failure to submit the reports outlining those findings represented one of the JCPOA's biggest flaws. What is the point of "unprecedented" monitoring of these sites if the IAEA never established a baseline of Iran's weaponization efforts? "Fixing" the old deal by addressing sunsets, monitoring and missiles doesn't address today's problems: Nuclear weaponization, including Tehran's past activities and current violations, Iranian enrichment in underground facilities and its advanced centrifuge R&D. Even with the recent setbacks, the Islamic Republic is still hard at work on the weaponization of its nuclear program as it develops advanced centrifuges that give Tehran an easier clandestine "sneak out." These most powerful centrifuges—with fewer machines required to weaponize uranium—are easier to hide and more difficult to detect. Gone are the days of keeping Iran at "one year" from producing a sufficient quantity of weapon-grade uranium for a first bomb. Returning to the JCPOA allows Iran to build on its advances and to continue installing advanced enrichment and infrastructure in undisclosed new facilities. The JCPOA all but gives a green light to the regime to clandestinely accumulate the enriched uranium it needs for a bomb, or several bombs. There are new concerns, too. The regime's advances in critical weaponization activities, like metal uranium processing, hot cells and irradiation of 20 percent-enriched materials, also must be addressed. All of this can help the regime build a nuclear weapon. A "longer, stronger" deal must prevent Iran from being a "nuclear threshold country." The clerical regime cannot maintain a "civilian nuclear program" in underground facilities, and it must come clean about the past. A new deal must address all three elements of Tehran's illicit nuclear program: fissile materials, weaponization and the means of delivery. There may be time for a broader agreement that covers the regime's support for terrorism, as well as other regional concerns. But the nuclear problem must be solved first, or we run the risk of American diplomats giving concrete nuclear concessions for unenforceable Iranian commitments to limit their other nefarious regional activities. The U.S. can permanently cut off Iran's pathways to nuclear weapons or collapse at the negotiating table. It's now time for the Biden administration to choose. Jacob Nagel is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) and a visiting professor at the Technion Aerospace faculty. He previously served as acting national security adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and as head of the National Security Council. Mark Dubowitz is FDD's chief executive. An expert on Iran's nuclear program and sanctions, he was sanctioned by Iran in 2019. The views expressed in this article are the writers' own.

No matter the format, the end result is hard to escape: another bad deal. A diplomatic collapse is coming, based on a familiar but wrongheaded negotiating approach by American diplomats. This coming collapse is not hard to understand. The Biden administration is imploring the Islamic Republic of Iran to return to compliance with the JCPOA—and the regime's talented negotiating team is playing hard to get. The talks revolve primarily around what the West should pay the world's most prolific state sponsor of terrorism for the privilege of re-entering a faulty nuclear agreement that in 2015 granted Iran everything it wanted—namely, a patient pathway to atomic weapons and massive economic relief. Nuclear diplomacy is fine, but it must be shaped by American leverage. That leverage is strong right now, with Iran's accessible foreign exchange reserves down from over $120 billion in 2018 to just $4 billion. The Iranian government is running on fumes and facing an economic crisis. To make matters worse for the clerical regime, the main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz was reportedly set back by around nine months because of an explosion earlier this month. Its nuclear weaponization ambitions were also delayed significantly by the assassination last November of the longtime head of its military-nuclear program, Mohsen Fahkrizadeh. Finally, the regime is still struggling to regain its footing regionally after the Trump administration in January 2020 took out the Islamic Republic's most talented battlefield commander, Qassem Suleimani. All of this is leverage for Washington. And that leverage can be further enhanced by building a credible military threat to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities if the mullahs move to a bomb. The Biden team says it seeks a "longer, stronger, broader" deal. But this is not possible unless the White House sets forth a new Iran policy that is not held hostage by the JCPOA. A rapid return to the old agreement—or even worse, an incremental return—cedes crucial leverage to Tehran. Such an approach gives the regime zero incentive to negotiate another deal. The Iranian strategy is clear: wield the threat of nuclear escalation to extort massive economic concessions in the form of American sanction relief and a return to the JCPOA. This will give the regime tens of billions of dollars and allow it to forge ahead on nuclear R&D (sadly, the regime's advances are based on knowledge and production capabilities they gained by violating the 2015 agreement). By returning to the JCPOA, the regime can legally install advanced centrifuges, build up their enrichment capabilities and wait for key restrictions to sunset over the next two to nine years. After 2030, there will be no prohibitions on the Islamic Republic's ability to enrich massive uranium quantities to weapon-grade. The regime is currently enriching uranium at 60 percent and threatening to go up to 90 percent and quickly moving toward industrial-scale production capabilities—including second- and third-generation centrifuges that are more efficient in uranium enrichment. Some of these machines were already installed underground at Natanz. The explosion at Natanz and the July 2020 destruction of an advanced centrifuge assembly facility did significant damage. But these actions will only temporarily set back Tehran's nuclear ambitions. The Islamic Republic can now produce advanced centrifuges in large quantities. Overall, the regime can enrich uranium three to ten times faster, to all levels, and in clandestine facilities. It's game, set, match unless the Biden administration pushes for a new deal that requires Tehran to fully account for its military-nuclear activities—now known to the world because of the Iran Nuclear Archive that Israel's Mossad spirited out of Iran in 2018. The Iranian violations are even worse in light of the recent and detailed findings of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that the clerical regime has been hiding undisclosed nuclear materials. In short, the IAEA's 2015 decision—pushed by then-Secretary of State John Kerry—to close its investigation into the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program was a serious mistake. The Archive findings and the IAEA's discoveries from its visits of Iranian nuclear sites demonstrated that the Islamic Republic was much closer to weaponization than was previously believed. The IAEA's failure to submit the reports outlining those findings represented one of the JCPOA's biggest flaws. What is the point of "unprecedented" monitoring of these sites if the IAEA never established a baseline of Iran's weaponization efforts? "Fixing" the old deal by addressing sunsets, monitoring and missiles doesn't address today's problems: Nuclear weaponization, including Tehran's past activities and current violations, Iranian enrichment in underground facilities and its advanced centrifuge R&D. Even with the recent setbacks, the Islamic Republic is still hard at work on the weaponization of its nuclear program as it develops advanced centrifuges that give Tehran an easier clandestine "sneak out." These most powerful centrifuges—with fewer machines required to weaponize uranium—are easier to hide and more difficult to detect. Gone are the days of keeping Iran at "one year" from producing a sufficient quantity of weapon-grade uranium for a first bomb. Returning to the JCPOA allows Iran to build on its advances and to continue installing advanced enrichment and infrastructure in undisclosed new facilities. The JCPOA all but gives a green light to the regime to clandestinely accumulate the enriched uranium it needs for a bomb, or several bombs. There are new concerns, too. The regime's advances in critical weaponization activities, like metal uranium processing, hot cells and irradiation of 20 percent-enriched materials, also must be addressed. All of this can help the regime build a nuclear weapon. A "longer, stronger" deal must prevent Iran from being a "nuclear threshold country." The clerical regime cannot maintain a "civilian nuclear program" in underground facilities, and it must come clean about the past. A new deal must address all three elements of Tehran's illicit nuclear program: fissile materials, weaponization and the means of delivery. There may be time for a broader agreement that covers the regime's support for terrorism, as well as other regional concerns. But the nuclear problem must be solved first, or we run the risk of American diplomats giving concrete nuclear concessions for unenforceable Iranian commitments to limit their other nefarious regional activities. The U.S. can permanently cut off Iran's pathways to nuclear weapons or collapse at the negotiating table. It's now time for the Biden administration to choose.

News article:
WASHINGTON (JTA) — Joe Biden’s Iran deal inbox has been quite full lately. On March 10, 70 Democrats and 70 Republicans in the House sent the president a letter in the hopes that “any agreement or set of agreements with Iran must be comprehensive in nature” — meaning any reentry into the 2015 nuclear agreement should also curb Iran’s non-nuclear misbehavior. Two weeks later, a bipartisan group of 43 senators sent something similar. Two weeks after that, 27 Senate Democrats sent one urging the president to return to the deal right away. It’s clear that America’s pro-Israel community, along with foreign policy wonks in Congress, wants to influence Biden’s decision-making on Iran. There is bipartisan agreement that something must be done to counter Iran’s ever-growing nuclear weapons program and its promotion of terrorism in the Middle East. But the invested parties are far from consensus on what that something is. Underlying the unease are big questions: How does one project “toughness” on Iran? Is there any way for moderate liberals and conservatives to do so in reentering a deal that the American right — and much of the American Jewish community — has tarnished as capitulation to an evil enemy? Add a major wrinkle: The Biden administration has yet to issue a coherent policy. U.S. officials are negotiating with other countries about rejoining the ’15 deal, but they have yet to outline what if anything they want to see changed in the pact, or what concessions, if any, the United States may offer. That hasn’t stopped groups on the right from opposing a reentry and those on the left from pressing for an accelerated reupping. AIPAC, the powerhouse centrist pro-Israel lobby, is playing a wait-and-see game. For now, the lobby’s main Iran-related vehicle is a bipartisan Senate letter that is an unobjectionable wish list, although as more details of the Biden Iran policy emerge, AIPAC may become more confrontational. Biden has said he wants the United States and Iran back in compliance with the nuclear deal as soon as possible, but how that happens is stuck in a who-blinks-first standoff: Does Biden roll back sanctions imposed by his predecessor, Donald Trump, who left the deal in 2018, or does Iran roll back the uranium enrichment it has accelerated since Trump quit the deal? And what happens after that: Does the agreement remain intact or is it amended? The parties to the original deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, have spent two weeks in Vienna to work out a sequence, and Biden administration officials are telling Democrats in Congress that it’s going well without offering details. The lack of details creates a dilemma for Middle East policy influencers who are eager for a say in how U.S.-Iran relations take shape. A bipartisan Senate letter to Biden before the current talks started, backed by AIPAC, was emblematic of the dilemma: In the absence of particulars about the negotiations, the letter was unobjectionable, a summary of what everyone wants, except for Iran. “We strongly believe that you should use the full force of our diplomatic and economic tools in concert with our allies on the United Nations Security Council and in the region to reach an agreement that prevents Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons and meaningfully constrains its destabilizing activity throughout the Middle East and its ballistic missile program,” the letter sent March 25 said. Biden has committed to each of the letter’s demands: no nukes for Iran, and an expanded deal that would encompass what the JCPOA omitted, including stemming Iran’s malign actions in the region and its missile program. But Biden will not yet say what kind of sequence he wants, except to make clear to Iran that the United States would not make concessions before the sides are recommitted to the deal. At a news conference Friday, the president said he was “pleased” with the discussions underway and was ready to “move forward … without us making concessions that I’m — we’re just not willing to make.” He said it was “premature” to make “a judgment as to what the outcome will be, but we’re still talking.” Quoting anonymous sources, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the U.S. team had indicated it was ready to ease some sanctions in the finance and oil sectors. While AIPAC is hanging back for now, a red line for the lobby would be sanctions relief before Iran commits to making the nuclear restrictions permanent. The lobby is telling Congress that lifting sanctions in exchange for just a partial rollback of Iran’s nuclear activities is not enough. If that’s the path Biden takes, AIPAC likely will be more outspoken and will endeavor to rally friendly Democrats to pressure Biden to roll back any concessions. Other actors are less patient and want to see action soon. The loudest voice for action belongs to whoever sabotaged Iran’s nuclear facility at Natanz earlier this month, reportedly crippling the site’s uranium enrichment capability. Iran has blamed Israel, and Israel is not commenting. Whether or not Israel is behind the sabotage, its officials are leaking furiously that Biden’s plans terrify them. An Israeli Security Cabinet meeting on Sunday night unleashed a flurry of leaks. “The Iranians smell that the Americans want an agreement at any price,” Channel 12 News quoted an official as saying, according to The Times of Israel. Republicans are vowing to use whatever powers they have in the minority to block a return to the deal. James Risch, an Idaho senator and the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, is backing a bill that would block sanctions relief. There is a companion bill in the House. Sanctions relief would allow Iran to rebuild its economy and weapons program to irreversible levels, said Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “It doesn’t matter what you do on the enrichment side, you’re going to allow these guys to develop all the infrastructure they need to ultimately attach a warhead to a ballistic missile. And then it’s game over,” said Dubowitz, whose organization was influential with the Trump administration in how it applied sanctions. There is pressure on the other side as well: dovish actors who believe the Biden administration is taking too long to come to an agreement, cognizant of Iranian elections in June that could return hard-liners to government. “We have a partner in Tehran that is clearly interested in rejoining the JCPOA, has political will to do it, has the diplomatic and technocratic expertise, and has a track record of living up to the terms of the agreement,” Eldar Mamedov, the political adviser to the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the European Parliament, said earlier this month in a conference organized by the Arms Control Association. “The whole idea that dragging out the U.S. return to JCPOA would somehow increase the leverage on Iran is a completely mistaken view. The attitudes are hardening in Tehran.” Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, the liberal Jewish Middle East policy group, said a key message of the group’s annual conference earlier this week was the urgency of returning to the deal. “Iran, without question, is of burning urgency,” Ben-Ami said Monday. “The talks are happening right now; the Iranian elections are in a couple of months. The agreement hangs by a thread.” Ben-Ami said J Street would oppose bringing the Iran deal before Congress for further congressional review, noting that it passed congressional muster in 2015. If Republicans do manage to raise the issue, he said, J Street would lobby Congress with polls showing that the vast majority of Jewish Americans opposed Trump’s pullout from the deal. Both congressional chambers are led by Democrats, but by tiny margins, so Republicans would have only to peel off a handful of Democrats to frustrate a return to the deal. A number of Democrats opposed the deal in 2015, and many of them are still in Congress. These days, however, even Democrats who opposed the deal six years ago fret that Trump’s pullout has heightened the risk to Israel. Iran retaliated against Trump for restoring and adding sanctions by increasing enrichment of fissile materials to 20% instead of the under 4% that was required under the deal. This week, retaliating for the attack on Natanz, Iran reportedly was reaching 60% uranium enrichment — much closer to the 90% or higher level required for weaponization. “I think most lawmakers, at least on the Democratic side, understand that what matters is what will be most effective in terms of keeping a nuclear weapon out of Iranian hands,” said Dylan Williams, J Street’s senior vice president for policy. “It’s menacing of Israel would turn from threats to nightmares were Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.” Last week, a J Street-backed Senate letter said that “there is no question that one of your early pressing national security priorities should be to return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to address the threat posed by Iran’s nuclear program.” That letter was signed by 27 Democrats, including moderates who are seen as close to AIPAC like Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. AIPAC’s letter, with its avoidance of commitment to any specific action, drew the support of 15 Democrats. (Casey signed both letters.) So far, the Biden administration’s plan for Iran doesn’t go much beyond getting the band back together. Top Biden administration officials are telling Congress that one of the purposes of the talks now underway in Vienna is to rally the same countries that forced Iran to the table nearly a decade ago to unite again and get the Islamic Republic to negotiate a better deal. A senior Democratic congressional staffer who is regularly briefed by the negotiators described a plan to have the same countries that suspended oil purchases from Iran ahead of the launch of the 2013 talks that led to the 2015 deal to do so again. “You have to cut out all the oil deals until there is Iranian compliance, until they agree to sit down and extend these deadlines,” the staffer said, referring to the “sunset” provisions in the original deal that allow Iran to end restrictions on enrichment of nuclear fissile material. U.S. negotiators are sending those countries the message that Biden, unlike Trump, is ready to work with them and not go it alone, the staffer said. The original parties to the deal were the United States, Russia, China, Britain, Germany, France and Iran. Those countries successfully pressured other major Iran oil consumers like South Korea, India and Japan to join sanctions. Now, according to a Biden staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, the United States must convince those countries to collaborate anew. “You need to have U.N. buy-in,” the staffer said. “You have to go to Europe, Russia, Indonesia, South Korea, India, Japan and China and tell them a new sheriff is back in town.”

At a news conference Friday, the president said he was “pleased” with the discussions underway and was ready to “move forward … without us making concessions that I’m — we’re just not willing to make.” He said it was “premature” to make “a judgment as to what the outcome will be, but we’re still talking.” Quoting anonymous sources, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the U.S. team had indicated it was ready to ease some sanctions in the finance and oil sectors. While AIPAC is hanging back for now, a red line for the lobby would be sanctions relief before Iran commits to making the nuclear restrictions permanent. The lobby is telling Congress that lifting sanctions in exchange for just a partial rollback of Iran’s nuclear activities is not enough. If that’s the path Biden takes, AIPAC likely will be more outspoken and will endeavor to rally friendly Democrats to pressure Biden to roll back any concessions. Other actors are less patient and want to see action soon. The loudest voice for action belongs to whoever sabotaged Iran’s nuclear facility at Natanz earlier this month, reportedly crippling the site’s uranium enrichment capability. Iran has blamed Israel, and Israel is not commenting. Whether or not Israel is behind the sabotage, its officials are leaking furiously that Biden’s plans terrify them. An Israeli Security Cabinet meeting on Sunday night unleashed a flurry of leaks. “The Iranians smell that the Americans want an agreement at any price,” Channel 12 News quoted an official as saying, according to The Times of Israel. Republicans are vowing to use whatever powers they have in the minority to block a return to the deal. James Risch, an Idaho senator and the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, is backing a bill that would block sanctions relief. There is a companion bill in the House. Sanctions relief would allow Iran to rebuild its economy and weapons program to irreversible levels, said Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “It doesn’t matter what you do on the enrichment side, you’re going to allow these guys to develop all the infrastructure they need to ultimately attach a warhead to a ballistic missile. And then it’s game over,” said Dubowitz, whose organization was influential with the Trump administration in how it applied sanctions. There is pressure on the other side as well: dovish actors who believe the Biden administration is taking too long to come to an agreement, cognizant of Iranian elections in June that could return hard-liners to government. “We have a partner in Tehran that is clearly interested in rejoining the JCPOA, has political will to do it, has the diplomatic and technocratic expertise, and has a track record of living up to the terms of the agreement,” Eldar Mamedov, the political adviser to the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the European Parliament, said earlier this month in a conference organized by the Arms Control Association. “The whole idea that dragging out the U.S. return to JCPOA would somehow increase the leverage on Iran is a completely mistaken view. The attitudes are hardening in Tehran.” Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, the liberal Jewish Middle East policy group, said a key message of the group’s annual conference earlier this week was the urgency of returning to the deal. “Iran, without question, is of burning urgency,” Ben-Ami said Monday. “The talks are happening right now; the Iranian elections are in a couple of months. The agreement hangs by a thread.” Ben-Ami said J Street would oppose bringing the Iran deal before Congress for further congressional review, noting that it passed congressional muster in 2015. If Republicans do manage to raise the issue, he said, J Street would lobby Congress with polls showing that the vast majority of Jewish Americans opposed Trump’s pullout from the deal. Both congressional chambers are led by Democrats, but by tiny margins, so Republicans would have only to peel off a handful of Democrats to frustrate a return to the deal. A number of Democrats opposed the deal in 2015, and many of them are still in Congress. These days, however, even Democrats who opposed the deal six years ago fret that Trump’s pullout has heightened the risk to Israel. Iran retaliated against Trump for restoring and adding sanctions by increasing enrichment of fissile materials to 20% instead of the under 4% that was required under the deal. This week, retaliating for the attack on Natanz, Iran reportedly was reaching 60% uranium enrichment — much closer to the 90% or higher level required for weaponization. “I think most lawmakers, at least on the Democratic side, understand that what matters is what will be most effective in terms of keeping a nuclear weapon out of Iranian hands,” said Dylan Williams, J Street’s senior vice president for policy. “It’s menacing of Israel would turn from threats to nightmares were Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.” Last week, a J Street-backed Senate letter said that “there is no question that one of your early pressing national security priorities should be to return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to address the threat posed by Iran’s nuclear program.” That letter was signed by 27 Democrats, including moderates who are seen as close to AIPAC like Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. AIPAC’s letter, with its avoidance of commitment to any specific action, drew the support of 15 Democrats. (Casey signed both letters.) So far, the Biden administration’s plan for Iran doesn’t go much beyond getting the band back together. Top Biden administration officials are telling Congress that one of the purposes of the talks now underway in Vienna is to rally the same countries that forced Iran to the table nearly a decade ago to unite again and get the Islamic Republic to negotiate a better deal. A senior Democratic congressional staffer who is regularly briefed by the negotiators described a plan to have the same countries that suspended oil purchases from Iran ahead of the launch of the 2013 talks that led to the 2015 deal to do so again. “You have to cut out all the oil deals until there is Iranian compliance, until they agree to sit down and extend these deadlines,” the staffer said, referring to the “sunset” provisions in the original deal that allow Iran to end restrictions on enrichment of nuclear fissile material. U.S. negotiators are sending those countries the message that Biden, unlike Trump, is ready to work with them and not go it alone, the staffer said. The original parties to the deal were the United States, Russia, China, Britain, Germany, France and Iran. Those countries successfully pressured other major Iran oil consumers like South Korea, India and Japan to join sanctions. Now, according to a Biden staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, the United States must convince those countries to collaborate anew. “You need to have U.N. buy-in,” the staffer said. “You have to go to Europe, Russia, Indonesia, South Korea, India, Japan and China and tell them a new sheriff is back in town.”

News article:
WASHINGTON (JTA) — Joe Biden’s Iran deal inbox has been quite full lately. On March 10, 70 Democrats and 70 Republicans in the House sent the president a letter in the hopes that “any agreement or set of agreements with Iran must be comprehensive in nature” — meaning any reentry into the 2015 nuclear agreement should also curb Iran’s non-nuclear misbehavior. Two weeks later, a bipartisan group of 43 senators sent something similar. Two weeks after that, 27 Senate Democrats sent one urging the president to return to the deal right away. It’s clear that America’s pro-Israel community, along with foreign policy wonks in Congress, wants to influence Biden’s decision-making on Iran. There is bipartisan agreement that something must be done to counter Iran’s ever-growing nuclear weapons program and its promotion of terrorism in the Middle East. But the invested parties are far from consensus on what that something is. Underlying the unease are big questions: How does one project “toughness” on Iran? Is there any way for moderate liberals and conservatives to do so in reentering a deal that the American right — and much of the American Jewish community — has tarnished as capitulation to an evil enemy? Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Add a major wrinkle: The Biden administration has yet to issue a coherent policy. US officials are negotiating with other countries about rejoining the 2015 deal, but they have yet to outline what if anything they want to see changed in the pact, or what concessions, if any, the United States may offer. That hasn’t stopped groups on the right from opposing a reentry and those on the left from pressing for an accelerated reupping. AIPAC, the powerhouse centrist pro-Israel lobby, is playing a wait-and-see game. For now, the lobby’s main Iran-related vehicle is a bipartisan Senate letter that is an unobjectionable wish list, although as more details of the Biden Iran policy emerge, AIPAC may become more confrontational. Biden has said he wants the United States and Iran back in compliance with the nuclear deal as soon as possible, but how that happens is stuck in a who-blinks-first standoff: Does Biden roll back sanctions imposed by his predecessor, Donald Trump, who left the deal in 2018, or does Iran roll back the uranium enrichment it has accelerated since Trump quit the deal? And what happens after that: Does the agreement remain intact or is it amended? Advertisement The parties to the original deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, have spent two weeks in Vienna to work out a sequence, and Biden administration officials are telling Democrats in Congress that it’s going well without offering details. The lack of details creates a dilemma for Middle East policy influencers who are eager for a say in how US-Iran relations take shape. A bipartisan Senate letter to Biden before the current talks started, backed by AIPAC, was emblematic of the dilemma: In the absence of particulars about the negotiations, the letter was unobjectionable, a summary of what everyone wants, except for Iran. “We strongly believe that you should use the full force of our diplomatic and economic tools in concert with our allies on the United Nations Security Council and in the region to reach an agreement that prevents Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons and meaningfully constrains its destabilizing activity throughout the Middle East and its ballistic missile program,” the letter sent March 25 said.

But Biden will not yet say what kind of sequence he wants, except to make clear to Iran that the United States would not make concessions before the sides are recommitted to the deal. At a news conference Friday, the president said he was “pleased” with the discussions underway and was ready to “move forward… without us making concessions that I’m — we’re just not willing to make.” Advertisement He said it was “premature” to make “a judgment as to what the outcome will be, but we’re still talking.” Quoting anonymous sources, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the US team had indicated it was ready to ease some sanctions in the finance and oil sectors. While AIPAC is hanging back for now, a red line for the lobby would be sanctions relief before Iran commits to making the nuclear restrictions permanent. The lobby is telling Congress that lifting sanctions in exchange for just a partial rollback of Iran’s nuclear activities is not enough. If that’s the path Biden takes, AIPAC likely will be more outspoken and will endeavor to rally friendly Democrats to pressure Biden to roll back any concessions. Other actors are less patient and want to see action soon. The loudest voice for action belongs to whoever sabotaged Iran’s nuclear facility at Natanz earlier this month, reportedly crippling the site’s uranium enrichment capability. Iran has blamed Israel, and Israel is not commenting. Whether or not Israel is behind the sabotage, its officials are leaking furiously that Biden’s plans terrify them. An Israeli Security Cabinet meeting on Sunday night unleashed a flurry of leaks. “The Iranians smell that the Americans want an agreement at any price,” Channel 12 news quoted an official as saying. Republicans are vowing to use whatever powers they have in the minority to block a return to the deal. James Risch, an Idaho senator and the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, is backing a bill that would block sanctions relief. There is a companion bill in the House. Sanctions relief would allow Iran to rebuild its economy and weapons program to irreversible levels, said Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Advertisement “It doesn’t matter what you do on the enrichment side, you’re going to allow these guys to develop all the infrastructure they need to ultimately attach a warhead to a ballistic missile. And then it’s game over,” said Dubowitz, whose organization was influential with the Trump administration in how it applied sanctions. There is pressure on the other side as well: dovish actors who believe the Biden administration is taking too long to come to an agreement, cognizant of Iranian elections in June that could return hard-liners to government. “We have a partner in Tehran that is clearly interested in rejoining the JCPOA, has political will to do it, has the diplomatic and technocratic expertise, and has a track record of living up to the terms of the agreement,” Eldar Mamedov, the political adviser to the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the European Parliament, said earlier this month in a conference organized by the Arms Control Association. “The whole idea that dragging out the US return to JCPOA would somehow increase the leverage on Iran is a completely mistaken view. The attitudes are hardening in Tehran.” Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, the liberal Jewish Middle East policy group, said a key message of the group’s annual conference earlier this week was the urgency of returning to the deal. “Iran, without question, is of burning urgency,” Ben-Ami said Monday. “The talks are happening right now; the Iranian elections are in a couple of months. The agreement hangs by a thread.” Ben-Ami said J Street would oppose bringing the Iran deal before Congress for further congressional review, noting that it passed congressional muster in 2015. If Republicans do manage to raise the issue, he said, J Street would lobby Congress with polls showing that the vast majority of Jewish Americans opposed Trump’s pullout from the deal. Both congressional chambers are led by Democrats, but by tiny margins, so Republicans would have only to peel off a handful of Democrats to frustrate a return to the deal. A number of Democrats opposed the deal in 2015, and many of them are still in Congress. Advertisement These days, however, even Democrats who opposed the deal six years ago fret that Trump’s pullout has heightened the risk to Israel. Iran retaliated against Trump for restoring and adding sanctions by increasing enrichment of fissile materials to 20% instead of the under 4% that was required under the deal. This week, retaliating for the attack on Natanz, Iran reportedly was reaching 60% uranium enrichment — much closer to the 90% or higher level required for weaponization. “I think most lawmakers, at least on the Democratic side, understand that what matters is what will be most effective in terms of keeping a nuclear weapon out of Iranian hands,” said Dylan Williams, J Street’s senior vice president for policy. “It’s menacing of Israel would turn from threats to nightmares were Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.” Last week, a J Street-backed Senate letter said that “there is no question that one of your early pressing national security priorities should be to return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to address the threat posed by Iran’s nuclear program.” That letter was signed by 27 Democrats, including moderates who are seen as close to AIPAC like Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. AIPAC’s letter, with its avoidance of commitment to any specific action, drew the support of 15 Democrats. (Casey signed both letters.) So far, the Biden administration’s plan for Iran doesn’t go much beyond getting the band back together. Top Biden administration officials are telling Congress that one of the purposes of the talks now underway in Vienna is to rally the same countries that forced Iran to the table nearly a decade ago to unite again and get the Islamic Republic to negotiate a better deal. A senior Democratic congressional staffer who is regularly briefed by the negotiators described a plan to have the same countries that suspended oil purchases from Iran ahead of the launch of the 2013 talks that led to the 2015 deal to do so again. “You have to cut out all the oil deals until there is Iranian compliance, until they agree to sit down and extend these deadlines,” the staffer said, referring to the “sunset” provisions in the original deal that allow Iran to end restrictions on enrichment of nuclear fissile material. US negotiators are sending those countries the message that Biden, unlike Trump, is ready to work with them and not go it alone, the staffer said. The original parties to the deal were the United States, Russia, China, Britain, Germany, France and Iran. Those countries successfully pressured other major Iran oil consumers like South Korea, India and Japan to join sanctions. Now, according to a Biden staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, the United States must convince those countries to collaborate anew. “You need to have UN buy-in,” the staffer said. “You have to go to Europe, Russia, Indonesia, South Korea, India, Japan and China and tell them a new sheriff is back in town.”

News article:
Two lawmakers have written to President Biden urging him to place human rights, and holding human rights abusers accountable, at the center of his Iran policy -- just as a resolution backing a secular and democratic Iran has picked up majority support in the House. The resolution, introduced by Reps. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., and Brad Sherman, D-Calif., backs "the Iranian people’s desire for a democratic, secular, and nonnuclear Republic of Iran" and condemns "violations of human rights and state-sponsored terrorism by the Iranian Government." BIPARTISAN HOUSE RESOLUTION BACKS PUSH FOR A DEMOCRATIC IRAN, CONDEMNS REGIME'S TERROR PLOTS It is similar to a resolution introduced last year which also picked up majority support in the House. Introduced in February, it now has more than 220 co-sponsors across the political spectrum, meaning it has majority support. Sherman and McClintock wrote to Biden, touting the resolution and urging him to keep human rights a central part of the policy toward Tehran. "We believe this resolution deserves the attention of your administration because it emphasizes three important pillars, all of which should play a central role in your administration’s policy towards Iran: democracy, human rights, and holding human rights abusers accountable," the lawmakers write. Both the resolution and the letter note "egregious" human rights violations by the theocratic regime currently in control in Tehran -- including the deaths of more than 1,000 protesters in anti-government protests. The resolution is backed by Iranian dissident groups, such as the Organization of America-Iranian Communities and the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) -- whose leader’s 10 point plan is explicitly backed in the resolution. NCRI President-elect Maryam Rajavi backed the resolution and warned against making concessions to the regime. "Experience has shown that no amount of political and economic concessions will change the behavior of the regime," she said. "On the contrary, it will only embolden the mullahs to continue suppressing the Iranian people, terrorism and warmongering, and pursuing nuclear weapons." IRAN'S LONG HISTORY OF TERROR AND AGGRESSION In response to the letter, a senior administration official told Fox News that the Biden administration will "continue to call out and stand up to Iran’s human rights abuses, which include large-scale arbitrary or unlawful detention of individuals, some of whom have faced torture and execution after unfair trials." IRAN’S FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS JOHN KERRY TOLD HIM ABOUT ISRAELI COVERT OPERATIONS IN SYRIA The official also said the administration will continue to maintain sanctions on Iranian entities perpetuating human rights abuses and use "all appropriate tools" to promote accountability for those engaging in human rights abuses, and to hold Iran accountable. The resolution comes as talks are underway in Vienna to bring the U.S. and Iran back into the Iranian nuclear deal -- from which the Trump administration withdrew in 2018, in favor of a "maximum pressure" campaign that reimposed waves of sanctions on Iran. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Biden administration has looked to re-enter the accord, while ending a push to reimpose U.N. sanctions on Tehran -- which has drawn criticism from former Trump administration officials. Meanwhile, former Secretary of State John Kerry, who is now serving as a climate envoy in the administration, is facing criticism over allegations he shared information about Israeli operations in Syria with the Iranian foreign minister -- allegations that Kerry has described as "unequivocally false."

News article:
If President Joe Biden changes or adjusts the Iran nuclear deal—the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA—then he is obligated to bring it to Congress. This is not the wishful thinking of critics of the agreement; it is according to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA) of 2015. In May of 2015, Congress passed INARA, giving itself the right to review any future agreements or modifications reached regarding the Iran nuclear deal, in essence reserving the right to assess any changes made. Since it’s almost impossible to restore the deal intact since six years have passed since it was written, a return to the JCPOA promised by Biden means a new agreement. The administration’s strategy will be to ignore Congress, claiming that any changes will not be substantive, so INARA does not apply. According to former Assistant Secretary of State Stephen Rademaker, writing in RealClearWorld, “The Act mandates congressional review—and provides for potential disapproval—of not just the JCPOA, but any “agreement related to the nuclear program of Iran … regardless of the form it takes … the Act (also) prohibits the extension of sanctions relief during the 30 days the law sets aside for congressional review of any nuclear agreement with Iran.” Biden promised to rejoin the JCPOA, and lengthen and strengthen the unsigned agreement. Unfortunately, his Iran envoy Robert Malley has said that if Iran returns to full compliance, then they will immediately get sanctions relief. Does that mean removing all sanctions, including those for their egregious human-rights abuses, missile proliferation and counterterrorism? U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that no significant amendments will be added before rejoining the agreement. I don’t follow the administration’s logic—beginning negotiations with the wily Iranian regime by giving away all its leverage. In response this month, Sens. James Risch (-Wis.) and Hagerty (R-Tenn.) introduced legislation called the Iran Sanctions Relief Review Act of 2021 (S. 488) to address the administration’s contradictory approach and messaging. Risch said, “It’s increasingly clear that the Biden administration’s promises to ‘lengthen and strengthen’ the Iran nuclear deal are instead an attempt to re-enter the flawed 2015 JCPOA at any cost. … This bill would require Congress to approve any Biden administration effort to lift sanctions against the Iranian regime. The United States currently maintains a position of significant leverage with Iran because our sanctions are working. Given that reality, the administration should keep its promises to address the JCPOA’s looming sunsets, as well as Iran’s regional terrorism, ballistic-missile activity and wrongful imprisonment of Americans.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories And that is where INARA comes in. If Biden keeps his promise to be the anti-Trump, following the law he needs to go back to Congress before obligating America to trust the theocratic Islamic regime, which hid and lied about its nuclear program for decades. Like all recent executives of both parties, Biden will claim that foreign policy is the exclusive purview of the president. That is because the Senate has allowed presidents to run roughshod over its constitutional duties for decades. The Senate should speak up now—that includes members on both sides of the aisle. Will Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), who voted against the deal the first time, speak up again and act? The JCPOA in 2015 should have been submitted to the Senate as a treaty, being the most consequential American foreign-policy agreement of the 21st century. According to an article in Foreign Policy by Daniel Kutzer, Aaron Miller and Steven Simon, “Little constituency exists in Washington for returning to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran on precisely the same terms as before. Republicans and even some crucial Democrats oppose it.” If that is true, then the president is bound by law to send any updates or changes to Congress for review. I received a request from a reader about what voters should “ask for” from Congress. First, don’t be fooled by rhetoric that claims we are all on the same page, agreeing that Iran should never get a nuclear weapon. That does not mean and is not the same as improving the JCPOA now. When Brett McGurk, Biden’s national security council coordinator for the Middle East, said this week concerning the United States and Israel’s goals regarding Iran, “there is no disagreement. … Iran can never get a nuclear weapon, period,” that is political doublespeak. It does not address that the JCPOA, which the administration has vowed to return to, still allows Iran to develop an industrial-size nuclear program in less than 10 years when its sunset provisions fully kick in. The answer for pro-Israel Americans is to let the Democratic Majority for Israel, the Jewish Democratic Council and their state legislators know the JCPOA’s weaknesses are your No. 1 foreign-policy concern. Let them know you expect Biden to keep his word to strengthen and lengthen the deal, but to do it before rejoining a flawed JCPOA. And you want the Senate to be able to weigh in and review the modifications. Let them know that rhetoric alone without a fundamental change of the sunset provisions is not enough. The handwriting is already on the wall for a return to the old JCPOA. Now is the time to speak up. Dr. Eric R. Mandel is the director of MEPIN, the Middle East Political Information Network.

The image shows Biden and Sullivan engaged in a serious discussion, which suggests that they are working hard to reach a deal. The image also shows that Biden is taking the lead in the negotiations, which is consistent with the news articles that describe him as being the driving force behind the effort to revive the deal.


News article:
If President Joe Biden changes or adjusts the Iran nuclear deal—the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA—then he is obligated to bring it to Congress. This is not the wishful thinking of critics of the agreement; it is according to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA) of 2015. In May of 2015, Congress passed INARA, giving itself the right to review any future agreements or modifications reached regarding the Iran nuclear deal, in essence reserving the right to assess any changes made. Since it’s almost impossible to restore the deal intact since six years have passed since it was written, a return to the JCPOA promised by Biden means a new agreement. The administration’s strategy will be to ignore Congress, claiming that any changes will not be substantive, so INARA does not apply. According to former Assistant Secretary of State Stephen Rademaker, writing in RealClearWorld, “The Act mandates congressional review—and provides for potential disapproval—of not just the JCPOA, but any “agreement related to the nuclear program of Iran … regardless of the form it takes … the Act (also) prohibits the extension of sanctions relief during the 30 days the law sets aside for congressional review of any nuclear agreement with Iran.” Biden promised to rejoin the JCPOA, and lengthen and strengthen the unsigned agreement. Unfortunately, his Iran envoy Robert Malley has said that if Iran returns to full compliance, then they will immediately get sanctions relief. Does that mean removing all sanctions, including those for their egregious human-rights abuses, missile proliferation and counterterrorism? U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that no significant amendments will be added before rejoining the agreement. I don’t follow the administration’s logic—beginning negotiations with the wily Iranian regime by giving away all its leverage. In response this month, Sens. James Risch (-Wis.) and Hagerty (R-Tenn.) introduced legislation called the Iran Sanctions Relief Review Act of 2021 (S. 488) to address the administration’s contradictory approach and messaging. Risch said, “It’s increasingly clear that the Biden administration’s promises to ‘lengthen and strengthen’ the Iran nuclear deal are instead an attempt to re-enter the flawed 2015 JCPOA at any cost. … This bill would require Congress to approve any Biden administration effort to lift sanctions against the Iranian regime. The United States currently maintains a position of significant leverage with Iran because our sanctions are working. Given that reality, the administration should keep its promises to address the JCPOA’s looming sunsets, as well as Iran’s regional terrorism, ballistic-missile activity and wrongful imprisonment of Americans.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories And that is where INARA comes in. If Biden keeps his promise to be the anti-Trump, following the law he needs to go back to Congress before obligating America to trust the theocratic Islamic regime, which hid and lied about its nuclear program for decades. Like all recent executives of both parties, Biden will claim that foreign policy is the exclusive purview of the president. That is because the Senate has allowed presidents to run roughshod over its constitutional duties for decades. The Senate should speak up now—that includes members on both sides of the aisle. Will Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), who voted against the deal the first time, speak up again and act? The JCPOA in 2015 should have been submitted to the Senate as a treaty, being the most consequential American foreign-policy agreement of the 21st century. According to an article in Foreign Policy by Daniel Kutzer, Aaron Miller and Steven Simon, “Little constituency exists in Washington for returning to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran on precisely the same terms as before. Republicans and even some crucial Democrats oppose it.” If that is true, then the president is bound by law to send any updates or changes to Congress for review. I received a request from a reader about what voters should “ask for” from Congress. First, don’t be fooled by rhetoric that claims we are all on the same page, agreeing that Iran should never get a nuclear weapon. That does not mean and is not the same as improving the JCPOA now. When Brett McGurk, Biden’s national security council coordinator for the Middle East, said this week concerning the United States and Israel’s goals regarding Iran, “there is no disagreement. … Iran can never get a nuclear weapon, period,” that is political doublespeak. It does not address that the JCPOA, which the administration has vowed to return to, still allows Iran to develop an industrial-size nuclear program in less than 10 years when its sunset provisions fully kick in. The answer for pro-Israel Americans is to let the Democratic Majority for Israel, the Jewish Democratic Council and their state legislators know the JCPOA’s weaknesses are your No. 1 foreign-policy concern. Let them know you expect Biden to keep his word to strengthen and lengthen the deal, but to do it before rejoining a flawed JCPOA. And you want the Senate to be able to weigh in and review the modifications. Let them know that rhetoric alone without a fundamental change of the sunset provisions is not enough. The handwriting is already on the wall for a return to the old JCPOA. Now is the time to speak up. Dr. Eric R. Mandel is the director of MEPIN, the Middle East Political Information Network. He regularly briefs members of the U.S. Senate, House and their foreign-policy advisers. He is a columnist for “The Jerusalem Post” and a contributor to i24TV, “The Hill,” JTA and “The Forward.”

News article:
https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/17320/biden-administration-iran-talks The Biden administration seems more determined than ever, however, to “reward” Iran’s dangerous and predatory regime by returning to a deal that has sunset clauses, as well as an expiration date after which the mullahs can enrich uranium, spin centrifuges at any level they desire, and make as many nuclear weapons as they like. A return to the 2025 deal would help to lift all major sanctions against Iran — sanctions it took years to put in place. The deal would enable Iran’s military sites to be exempt from inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The deal would allow Iran to rejoin the global financial system with full legitimacy, so that billions of dollars could begin flowing into the treasury of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its expanding militias across the Middle East. Finally, amid the talks to revive the “nuclear deal,” Iran’s leaders signed a 25-year strategic deal with China. In addition, the Iranian authorities are also engaged in high-level talks with Russia, “in order to help establish stability and combat American interventions.” The Biden administration’s silence in the wake of Iran’s increasing threats and nuclear defiance will only embolden and empower this predatory regime. The Iranian regime clearly believes it can get away with its violations. Instead of “rewarding” this dangerous Islamist regime, the Biden administration needs to take a firm stance and hold the ruling mullahs accountable. Amid talks — between the Iranian regime and France, the United Kingdom, China, Russia, plus Germany as well as indirect talks between the US and Iran — the ruling mullahs of Iran continue to ratchet up their threats and nuclear defiance. Last week, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi, announced that Iran would be enriching uranium to 60 percent — a level of enrichment that has no civilian purpose. Now the Iranian regime has begun enriching uranium to its highest level ever, 60 percent, close to weapons-grade level. Iranian leaders also began boasting about this development. Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, the speaker of the Iranian parliament wrote: “The young and God-believing Iranian scientists managed to achieve a 60% enriched uranium product… I congratulate the brave nation of Islamic Iran on this success. The Iranian nation’s willpower is miraculous and can defuse any conspiracy.” The Iranian regime also announced that it will be activating more centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear site. Abbas Araqchi, Iran’s chief negotiator at the talks, said that Iran would activate 1,000 advanced centrifuge machines. Now, instead of halting talks amid Iran’s defiance, the Biden administration appears happy that Iran is engaged in discussions. President Joe Biden told reporters in Washington during a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga: “We are, though, nonetheless pleased that Iran has continued to agree to engage in discussions — indirect discussions — with us and with our partners on how we move forward and what is needed to allow us to move back into the [nuclear deal]…”. The Biden administration seems more determined than ever, however, to “reward” Iran’s dangerous and predatory regime by returning to a deal that has sunset clauses, as well as an expiration date after which the mullahs can enrich uranium, spin centrifuges at any level they desire, and make as many nuclear weapons as they like. A return to the 2025 deal would help to lift all major sanctions against Iran — sanctions it took years to put in place. The deal would enable Iran’s military sites to be exempt from inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The deal would allow Iran to rejoin the global financial system with full legitimacy, so that billions of dollars could begin flowing into the treasury of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its expanding militias across the Middle East. The deal also disregards that the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) has placed the Iranian regime on the terrorism financing blacklist. The FATF pointed out in its report: “[G]iven Iran’s failure to enact the Palermo and Terrorist Financing Conventions in line with the FATF Standards, the FATF fully lifts the suspension of counter-measures and calls on its members and urges all jurisdictions to apply effective counter-measures…” Ever since President Biden declared that he wanted to resurrect the nuclear deal — which, incidentally, Iran never signed — the Iranian regime has been ratcheting up its threats and nuclear defiance in order to get more “rewards” — evidently for non-compliance — from the Biden administration. First, Iran began increasing uranium enrichment to 20% in January 2021. Then on January 4, in a move that apparently alarmed the US State Department, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) seized a South Korean-flagged ship carrying thousands of tons of ethanol in the Persian Gulf, according to Fars News. A US State Department spokesperson noted at the time: “The (Iranian) regime continues to threaten navigational rights and freedoms in the Persian Gulf as part of a clear attempt to extort the international community into relieving the pressure of sanctions. We join the Republic of Korea’s call for Iran to immediately release the tanker.” Later, on January 9, the Iranian parliament passed a law requiring the government to expel the International Atomic Energy Agency’s nuclear inspectors. This week, according to the US Navy, “Revolutionary Guard fast-boats swarmed U.S. Coast Guard vessels in [the] Persian Gulf.” Last September, Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told a forum organized by New York’s Council on Foreign Relations that Iran wants more money. “A sign of good faith is not to try to renegotiate what has already been negotiated,” he said, adding in the same speech that the US must “compensate us for our losses.” Iran’s top judicial body had already demanded that the US pay $130 billion in “damages.” And now the regime is enriching uranium at its highest level ever. The Biden administration has reportedly agreed in principle to the Iranian regime’s demand for compensation over the “economic damage”. Unnamed Israeli diplomats unofficially expressed disappointment over the nuclear negotiations and characterized the talks as “complete American capitulation” to Iran’s leaders. Israeli leaders are apparently seriously concerned that the Biden administration wants to revive the Iran nuclear deal “at all costs”. Finally, amid the talks to revive the “nuclear deal,” Iran’s leaders signed a 25-year strategic deal with China. In addition, the Iranian authorities are also engaged in high-level talks with Russia, “in order to help establish stability and combat American interventions.” The Biden administration’s silence in the wake of Iran’s increasing threats and nuclear defiance will only embolden and empower this predatory regime.

News article:
Florida Senator Marco Rubio is leading a group of 43 Republican senators demanding that President Joe Biden call off nuclear talks with Iran over the country funding Hamas amid the ongoing conflict in Israel. The senators made their demand in a letter sent to Biden on Wednesday. U.S. and Iranian officials have been meeting with the help of European intermediaries in Vienna, Austria to discuss resuming the 2015 nuclear deal that was cancelled by former President Donald Trump, which both the Biden administration and the government of Iran hope to renew. "Over the past couple days, Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, who are funded by Iran, have launched a series of rocket attacks into Israel," the senators wrote in the letter. "They are targeting Israeli civilians and cities, including Israel's capital Jerusalem. This is troubling as members of your administration are currently in Vienna negotiating with Iran, the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism." "The United States engaging in active negotiations with Iran and potentially providing billions of dollars in sanctions relief will no doubt contribute to Iran's support of Hamas and other terrorist organizations who attack Americans and our allies," they continued. "We call on you to immediately end negotiations with Iran, and make clear that sanctions relief will not be provided." The senators went on to note that the U.S. government has considered Hamas a terrorist organization since the 1990s, while the Iranian government "resoundingly supports" rocket attacks from the group during the current conflict with Israel. They demanded that Biden "unequivocally support Israel's right to defend itself against any and all terrorist attacks." The president "conveyed his unwavering support for Israel's security and for Israel's legitimate right to defend itself and its people" during a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, according to a White House readout of the call. The letter to Biden came on the same day that Abbas Araghchi, Iran's deputy foreign minister, said that any renewal of the deal was dependent on the U.S. "verifiably" lifting sanctions imposed on Iran after Trump pulled out of the deal in 2018. Araghchi said that the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, would "return to full implementation" after the condition was met. Hamas and other militant groups have fired over 1,000 rockets at Israel during three days of conflict. The attacks have killed at least 7 people, including one child. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes aimed at the Palestinian Gaza Strip have killed at least 67 people, including 16 children, according to the Associated Press. Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment.

The letter to Biden came on the same day that Abbas Araghchi, Iran's deputy foreign minister, said that any renewal of the deal was dependent on the U.S. "verifiably" lifting sanctions imposed on Iran after Trump pulled out of the deal in 2018. Araghchi said that the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, would "return to full implementation" after the condition was met. Hamas and other militant groups have fired over 1,000 rockets at Israel during three days of conflict. The attacks have killed at least 7 people, including one child. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes aimed at the Palestinian Gaza Strip have killed at least 67 people, including 16 children, according to the Associated Press. Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment.

News article:
Florida Senator Marco Rubio is leading a group of 43 Republican senators demanding that President Joe Biden call off nuclear talks with Iran over the country funding Hamas amid the ongoing conflict in Israel. The senators made their demand in a letter sent to Biden on Wednesday. U.S. and Iranian officials have been meeting with the help of European intermediaries in Vienna, Austria to discuss resuming the 2015 nuclear deal that was cancelled by former President Donald Trump, which both the Biden administration and the government of Iran hope to renew. "Over the past couple days, Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, who are funded by Iran, have launched a series of rocket attacks into Israel," the senators wrote in the letter. "They are targeting Israeli civilians and cities, including Israel's capital Jerusalem. This is troubling as members of your administration are currently in Vienna negotiating with Iran, the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism." "The United States engaging in active negotiations with Iran and potentially providing billions of dollars in sanctions relief will no doubt contribute to Iran's support of Hamas and other terrorist organizations who attack Americans and our allies," they continued. "We call on you to immediately end negotiations with Iran, and make clear that sanctions relief will not be provided." The senators went on to note that the U.S. government has considered Hamas a terrorist organization since the 1990s, while the Iranian government "resoundingly supports" rocket attacks from the group during the current conflict with Israel. They demanded that Biden "unequivocally support Israel's right to defend itself against any and all terrorist attacks." The president "conveyed his unwavering support for Israel's security and for Israel's legitimate right to defend itself and its people" during a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, according to a White House readout of the call. The letter to Biden came on the same day that Abbas Araghchi, Iran's deputy foreign minister, said that any renewal of the deal was dependent on the U.S. "verifiably" lifting sanctions imposed on Iran after Trump pulled out of the deal in 2018.

WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 12: US Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) (L) leaves after a hearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee at Hart Senate Office Building on May 12, 2021 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Alex Wong/Getty Images/AFP Washington - Rana Abtar US Republicans on Thursday stepped up calls on President Joe Biden to end talks to return to a nuclear agreement with Iran. In a letter to Biden, Republican senators said that any sanctions relief would let Iran step up funding for Hamas. "We call on you to immediately end negotiations with Iran, and make clear that sanctions relief will not be provided," said the letter led by Senator Marco Rubio and signed by all but six Senate Republicans. "Doing so would demonstrate a firm commitment to our closest ally in the region and to our own security interests." They also pointed to Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who “controls” Iran’s negotiating team in Vienna, while Tehran supports terrorism in the world. Republican senators detailed the attacks by Palestinian terrorist groups – more than 1,000 missiles fired at Israel in the past few days. “This includes the first missiles aimed at Jerusalem since 2014,” they reminded the president. “The United States engaging in active negotiations with Iran and potentially providing billions of dollars in sanctions relief will no doubt contribute to Iran’s support of Hamas and other terrorist organizations who attack Americans and our allies,” the Senators wrote. “In the wake of Hamas’ recent attacks on Israel, the United States should take all necessary measures to hold Tehran accountable and not ease sanctions on Iran under any circumstances,” they wrote. In the same context, a group of US senators sent a letter to the international business community, warning companies against resuming trade with Iran if the Biden administration removes sanctions on Tehran to rejoin the 2015 nuclear deal. “Your member companies may see this potential removal of US sanctions on Iran as a lucrative opportunity. Trust us, they should not,” the letter read. “If US sanctions on Iran were temporarily lifted and these firms decided to re-enter the Iranian market, they would be investing in ventures doomed to fail. Any agreement that does not receive the broad and bipartisan support of Congress will not survive if a Republican is elected president in 2024. "Any sanctions relief will also be severely limited if Republicans win back majorities in Congress in 2022,” the group stressed.

News article:
Topic: Biden's Iran Policy Region: Middle East Tags: IranNuclear WeaponsMilitaryFDDIran Nuclear Deal The United States is at an inflection point. Now is the time to reverse course. Iran’s Supreme Leader must be pleased another American president is desperate for a nuclear deal. The United States has all the leverage, yet President Joe Biden is rushing back to the flawed 2015 nuclear agreement, even though Iran cheated from the outset. Instead, Biden should use America’s leverage to secure a deal that puts a permanent end to Tehran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons by dismantling its enrichment program. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan explained earlier this month that the purpose of the ongoing negotiations in Vienna is to determine which “nuclear restrictions Iran will accept on its program to ensure that they can never get a nuclear weapon.” Therein lies the core problem with the accord: it will never prevent an Iranian nuke because instead of prohibiting Iran from enriching uranium and plutonium, it relies on a maze of unenforceable and eventually expiring restrictions to prevent the regime from weaponizing its enrichment program. In light of the numerous concessions Tehran secured as part of the 2015 agreement, zero enrichment may seem like an extraordinary demand. Yet not long ago, zero enrichment was the accepted policy. In 2006, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1696, demanding that the Islamic Republic “suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development.” Despite abandoning that position, former President Barack Obama sold the 2015 nuclear deal as ensuring “that all pathways to a bomb are cut off.” Yet enrichment itself is the pathway to a bomb. Obama touted the constraints the deal imposed on Iran’s nuclear program, yet restrictions on the production of enriched uranium end completely in 2031, less than ten years from now. To ensure Iranian compliance, Obama said, the accord has “the most comprehensive inspection and verification regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program.” He added, “The bottom line is, if Iran cheats, we can catch them—and we will.” We now know that is not true. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)—the nuclear watchdog responsible for inspections—did not know about Iran’s undeclared nuclear activities until it examined the nuclear archive Israeli agents smuggled out of Iran in 2018. Last month, Tehran began enriching uranium to 60 percent purity, a significant step toward the 90 percent+ level needed for an atomic bomb. There is no legitimate, civilian use for this activity. Also, this level of purity is well above the 3.67 percent envisioned in the 2015 deal. The Vienna negotiations reportedly have not led to an agreement on how Tehran will reverse these nuclear gains, especially whether the advanced centrifuges integral to this level of enrichment will be destroyed, removed from the country, or stored locally. And there is another serious problem. The United States has a policy where it asks its allies to forgo the development of enrichment and reprocessing capabilities before they can receive any support for peaceful nuclear energy programs. This is known as the gold standard and its rationale is simple: these techniques can be used to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. America’s Gulf allies are starting to notice the hypocrisy of the United States asking them to adopt the gold standard while Iran keeps its enrichment program. Yousef Al Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United States, noted that the UAE agreed to the gold standard in 2008, hoping it would be a model for when the U.S. negotiates with the Islamic Republic. Otaiba explained that the “problem was [U.S.] partners became . . . committed and assured to a gold standard that is safe and secure for nuclear power and [U.S.] adversaries got a better deal.” Mohammed bin Salman, crown prince and de facto leader of Saudi Arabia, said in 2018 that if Iran develops nuclear weapons the kingdom would “follow suit as soon as possible.” The most likely path would require Riyadh to develop enrichment or reprocessing technologies. If the UAE and Saudi Arabia pursue uranium enrichment programs, then that could set off an arms race in the Middle East. It is not too late for Biden to reverse course. Tehran’s negotiators have pushed a maximalist position requesting the removal of nearly all sanctions. The Biden administration should walk away and use its significant leverage to push for the “longer and stronger” deal Secretary of State Antony Blinken promised. The best way to make a deal longer and stronger is for it to mandate the elimination of Iran’s enrichment program. That accord could secure the bipartisan support necessary to be ratified as a treaty by the U.S. Senate. That way, it would remain intact during the next Republican administration. Tehran will balk, of course. It will try to convince our European allies to blame the United States for walking away. The Islamic Republic could also respond with military strikes against U.S. troops or allies in the region, but the U.S. has the upper hand militarily and can restore deterrence. Another response would be for Tehran to ramp up its enrichment program. But Iran’s nuclear extortion has an expiration date. The explosions at the Natanz enrichment site show the fragility of the clerical regime’s prized, supposedly secure, asset. The United Kingdom, and perhaps France and Germany, will join a pressure campaign if Iran overplays its hand. A unified or U.S.-UK sanctions campaign will send the Islamic Republic a strong message that it cannot divide America and its allies. Iran will not be able to withstand another unified pressure campaign. Just because it will be difficult to return to a zero enrichment policy doesn’t mean the United States should pursue a limited, flawed agreement instead. The United States is at an inflection point. Now is the time to reverse course.

News article:
Iranians will go to the polls to pick a new president on 18 June. Registration will formally start next week, with nearly two dozen individuals already declaring their intention to run, and over a dozen more expressing interest or being deemed potential candidates. Among the possible contenders is Brig. Gen (ret.) Hossein Dehghan, the former defence minister-turned advisor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Dehghan served as defence minister between 2013 and 2017 during President Hassan Rouhani’s first term. In recent media interviews, the retired commander has warned about the risks of a tactical conflict with the US escalating into a full-scale war, and stressed that Tehran was “not after negotiations for the sake of negotiations”. He added that Tehran would not rest until all forces from the US “terror state” were expelled from the Middle East in retaliation for the 3 January 2020 drone strike assassination of IRGC commander Qasem Soleimani. Saeed Mohammad, a second brigadier general in the IRGC and former head of the IRGC-controlled Khatam al-Anbiya Construction Headquarter engineering firm, has also announced his intention to run. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the populist conservative who served as president of Iran between 2005 and 2013, has yet to formally express plans to run in the 2021 elections, but has consistently ranked number one among prospective voters in a range of informal polling, pulling in up to 47 percent support in polls carried out between October 2020 and April 2021, far above the 6-11 percent support for Ebrahim Raisi, a conservative Muslim cleric who presently serves as Iran’s chief justice.

On Monday, Rouhani rejected the decision of the Guardian Council to study the candidates’ applications and ordered Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli to work in accordance with the current laws. “The requirements of the Ministry of Interior must be implemented within the framework of the law and the instructions of the Presidency of the Republic,” the president said in a letter addressed to Fazli. The Guardian Council has specified, however, that “all nominees must be between 40 and 70 years of age, hold at least a master’s degree or its equivalent, have experience of at least four years in managerial posts... and have no criminal record”, according to Iran’s state-run Press TV, as reported by AFP. The new terms come in implementation of a 2016 directive from Iran’s supreme leader Ali Khamenei for the council to clarify and “determine” the requirements. According to the council, the amendment has been passed on to the interior ministry, which will receive nominations from May 11-15 before submitting them to the vetting body. The updated requirements are likely to exclude some well-known figures, such as Rouhani’s telecom minister, Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi, who is 39, or the elite Revolutionary Guards’ Saeed Mohammad, whose rank is below major general. Former candidate Mohammad Gharazi, a 79-year-old ex-minister, would also be ruled out, as well as senior reformist figure Mostafa Tajzadeh, who was jailed during Iran’s 2009 protests, because of a conviction the following year. The increasing number of Revolutionary Guard generals who have announced their candidacy or are likely to be intending to compete in the presidential race, have raised fears of the “militarization” of the political circle within the Iranian regime, according to AFP.

News article:
Conservative hardliner Ebrahim Raisi has registered as a candidate in Iran's presidential elections which he is favored to win, potentially complicating talks between President Joe Biden and the Islamic Republic over its nuclear program. Biden wants to restore the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) struck between Tehran and Washington, DC in 2015 which promised Tehran economic incentives for curbing its nuclear program. Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump scuppered the deal, reimposing heavy sanctions to try to strongarm Tehran into new talks. Ongoing talks in Vienna between Tehran and the P4 + 1 group of countries has revived hopes of both a new nuclear deal as well as a rapprochement between Iran and the United States. However, Raisi, who currently heads the judiciary, had previously taken aim at the terms of the nuclear deal struck by incumbent Hassan Rouhani, who is constitutionally barred from running for president again. During the 2017 presidential campaign he lost, Raisi criticized Rouhani's "weak efforts" in negotiating the JCPOA, according to the Arab Weekly. The publication also reported that Raisi has the support of a wide range of conservatives and hardliners, who want to expand Iran's nuclear program. Meanwhile, Raisi's background as a hardline judge has raised concerns among reformists and rights groups. In the 1980s, he was among judges who imposed death penalties on thousands of political prisoners, Reuters reported. Raisi is a former attorney general and custodian of the Astan Quds Razavi which manages the Imam Reza shrine and was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2019 for human rights violations. Moves to broker an agreement on Iran's nuclear program comes amid a more positive attitude towards the U.S. in Iran since Biden took office. A survey by IranPoll in conjunction with the University of Maryland CISSM in February found a majority (51 percent) of Iranians approved of the JCPOA, compared with only 44 percent in October 2020. However, a clear majority (69 percent) said that Iran should not get involved in nuclear talks until the U.S. returns to the JCPOA and fulfills its obligations. Only 28 percent agreed that Tehran should immediately pursue a new nuclear agreement in talks with the United States. Raisi promoted his domestic policy credentials in his statement on Saturday, saying that focus of his candidacy would be to "fight poverty, corruption, humiliation and discrimination." "I have come as an independent to the stage to make changes in the executive management of the country," he added, according to Reuters. On Saturday, Ali Larijani, a former adviser to the supreme leader also signed up for the election on June 18 in which over 59 million people are eligible to vote. But there is expected to be a low turnout due to economic problems, international isolation, and a lack of basic freedoms, the Atlantic Council said this month. Analysis for the think tank by Shahin Milani said that it was uncertain whether the president would even have a "material impact" on Iran's domestic of foreign policy. "The presidency of the Islamic Republic is not as important or politically relevant as foreign observers might believe it to be," the piece said.

News article:
Khamenei’s hidden hand in Iran’s presidential vote Dr. Majid Rafizadeh Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei holds a remote meeting with students in Tehran. (File/AFP) Short Url https://arab.news/8zrn6 Iran’s election in June will determine not only the next president, but possibly also who will succeed Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Khamenei, who came to power in 1989, is the second-longest serving ruler in Iran in the past century, behind only Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who was in power from 1941 until the revolution of 1979. He is the longest-serving head of government in the Middle East. Given that he is 81 years old and suffers from several health problems, it is realistic to argue that he is considering who his successor will be. Grooming a political or religious figure to become the next supreme leader will ensure a smooth transition of power when Khamenei dies. The position of supreme leader is critical for the survival of the Islamic Republic and the continuation of the revolutionary concept of Ayatollah Khomeini — Velayat-e Faqih, or “guardianship of the Islamic jurist.” Whoever holds the position has the final say on Iran’s domestic and foreign policy and has significant control over the legislative, executive and judicial systems. In addition, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and intelligence service — the most powerful political and economic apparatuses in the country — report only to the supreme leader, who also has the authority to hand-pick military commanders as the chief of Iran’s military institutions. The supreme leader controls the bonyad charitable trusts (which control a significant part of Iran’s gross domestic product) and the Setad organization (the headquarters for executing the orders of the imam, which is worth more than $90 billion). The supreme leader dictates how the nation’s resources are spent, with a focus on exporting Iran’s revolutionary ideals and support for proxies and militia groups across the Middle East. Although Khamenei, high-level clerics from the Guardian Council and the Assembly of Experts, and the senior cadre of the IRGC are probably already secretly discussing who will be the next supreme leader, discussing it publicly is considered taboo. Tradition reveals that the position of president can be a crucial stepping stone when it comes to succeeding the supreme leader. Dr. Majid Rafizadeh The position of president can be a crucial stepping stone to succeeding the supreme leader. When Khomeini died in 1989, Khamenei was Iran’s sitting president. Even though the constitution states that the supreme leader should be elected by the Assembly of Experts, the former incumbent most probably selects his successor. For example, according to the late former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Khomeini chose Khamenei to be his successor. The regime even changed the constitution so that Khamenei qualified and Khomeini’s wish could be fulfilled. This partially explains why Khamenei has increased his interventions in the presidential election. He has even told the grandson of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Hassan Khomeini, not to run. The reformist political camp in Iran was reportedly intending to introduce Hassan Khomeini as its candidate. But Yasser Khomeini, brother of Hassan, declared: “The revolution’s supreme leader considered that Hassan Khomeini’s candidacy in the election was not appropriate. He expressed that he counts Hassan as his son, asking him not to enter this field in such circumstances.” The Guardian Council, which has the ultimate power over who runs for the presidency, has also significantly narrowed its terms for qualification. It has barred anyone older than 75 and younger than 40 from running. Even President Hassan Rouhani criticized the Guardian Council for introducing such restrictive rules, and said it had no legal right to do so. The new age restrictions prevent potential candidates such as 39-year-old Mohammed-Javad Azari Jahromi, the minister of information and communications technology, and 80-year-old Mohammed Gharazi, the former minister of petroleum, from standing in the election. To fulfill Khamenei’s demands, the Guardian Council will also probably disqualify figures such as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was president from 2005 to 2013, or anyone else the supreme leader disapproves of. The council also imposed new rules barring anyone with a criminal conviction or a lack of managerial experience from running in the election. As a result, people such as the reformist Mostafa Tajzadeh, who was jailed in 2009, cannot be a presidential candidate. It is worth noting that, when Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said he might run for president, the Guardian Council would have had difficulty disqualifying him because of his current position. However, the leaking of a controversial audio tape of Zarif resolved that issue as Khamenei publicly criticized him. Zarif subsequently announced that he would not be running. It is because the position of president can be seen as a stepping stone to succeeding the supreme leader that Khamenei and his inner circle are escalating their interventions in the election.

Grooming a political or religious figure to become the next supreme leader will ensure a smooth transition of power when Khamenei dies. The position of supreme leader is critical for the survival of the Islamic Republic and the continuation of the revolutionary concept of Ayatollah Khomeini — Velayat-e Faqih, or “guardianship of the Islamic jurist.” Whoever holds the position has the final say on Iran’s domestic and foreign policy and has significant control over the legislative, executive and judicial systems. In addition, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and intelligence service — the most powerful political and economic apparatuses in the country — report only to the supreme leader, who also has the authority to hand-pick military commanders as the chief of Iran’s military institutions. The supreme leader controls the bonyad charitable trusts (which control a significant part of Iran’s gross domestic product) and the Setad organization (the headquarters for executing the orders of the imam, which is worth more than $90 billion). The supreme leader dictates how the nation’s resources are spent, with a focus on exporting Iran’s revolutionary ideals and support for proxies and militia groups across the Middle East. Although Khamenei, high-level clerics from the Guardian Council and the Assembly of Experts, and the senior cadre of the IRGC are probably already secretly discussing who will be the next supreme leader, discussing it publicly is considered taboo. Tradition reveals that the position of president can be a crucial stepping stone when it comes to succeeding the supreme leader. Dr. Majid Rafizadeh The position of president can be a crucial stepping stone to succeeding the supreme leader. When Khomeini died in 1989, Khamenei was Iran’s sitting president. Even though the constitution states that the supreme leader should be elected by the Assembly of Experts, the former incumbent most probably selects his successor. For example, according to the late former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Khomeini chose Khamenei to be his successor. The regime even changed the constitution so that Khamenei qualified and Khomeini’s wish could be fulfilled. This partially explains why Khamenei has increased his interventions in the presidential election. He has even told the grandson of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Hassan Khomeini, not to run. The reformist political camp in Iran was reportedly intending to introduce Hassan Khomeini as its candidate. But Yasser Khomeini, brother of Hassan, declared: “The revolution’s supreme leader considered that Hassan Khomeini’s candidacy in the election was not appropriate. He expressed that he counts Hassan as his son, asking him not to enter this field in such circumstances.” The Guardian Council, which has the ultimate power over who runs for the presidency, has also significantly narrowed its terms for qualification. It has barred anyone older than 75 and younger than 40 from running. Even President Hassan Rouhani criticized the Guardian Council for introducing such restrictive rules, and said it had no legal right to do so. The new age restrictions prevent potential candidates such as 39-year-old Mohammed-Javad Azari Jahromi, the minister of information and communications technology, and 80-year-old Mohammed Gharazi, the former minister of petroleum, from standing in the election. To fulfill Khamenei’s demands, the Guardian Council will also probably disqualify figures such as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was president from 2005 to 2013, or anyone else the supreme leader disapproves of. The council also imposed new rules barring anyone with a criminal conviction or a lack of managerial experience from running in the election. As a result, people such as the reformist Mostafa Tajzadeh, who was jailed in 2009, cannot be a presidential candidate. It is worth noting that, when Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said he might run for president, the Guardian Council would have had difficulty disqualifying him because of his current position. However, the leaking of a controversial audio tape of Zarif resolved that issue as Khamenei publicly criticized him. Zarif subsequently announced that he would not be running. It is because the position of president can be seen as a stepping stone to succeeding the supreme leader that Khamenei and his inner circle are escalating their interventions in the election.

News article:
London, Tehran - Asharq Al-Awsat Reformists in Iran are at a critical crossroads of either backing the country’s First-Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri or former Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani in upcoming presidential elections. Larijani had distanced himself from conservatives after supporting the cleric-led country’s nuclear deal with world powers. On Monday, Iran’s Guardian Council, which is charged with interpreting the constitution and supervising elections, kicked off intensified meetings to review the applications of those willing to run in the presidential race slated for June 18. Guardian Council Spokesman Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei said that the Council would examine 40 out of about 600 applications submitted to the Iranian Interior Ministry in the last five days. A few hours after the candidates’ requests were studied, Islah-Press reported on Telegram that the Council refused to approve Expediency Council secretary and ex-commander of Revolutionary Guards General Mohsen Rezai. According to Islah-Press, another presidential hopeful refused by the Council was Gen. Saeed Muhammad, who is the executive director and second brigadier general in the Revolutionary Guard and commander of its economic branch, “Khatam-al Anbiya Construction.” Kadkhodaei rushed to deny the rumors in a statement published on the Council’s official website. In the statement, Kadkhodaei urged Iranians to ignore unverified news circulated by the media and hinted that those leaking information about candidacies before their official approval would be pursued by the judiciary. Iranian reformist Mohammed Ali Abtahi told the Iranian Labor News Agency (ILNA) that the “tsunami” of filed presidential bids last Saturday confused all equations, especially conservatives backing Ebrahim Raisi before Saeed Jalili entered the election scene. It is worth noting that Jalili is an advisor to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Abtahi called for “upholding the constitution” in approving the candidacy of presidential runners from both political currents. “Participation is at risk,” Abtahi warned, explaining that voter turnout affects both reformists and conservatives.

News article:
Iran on Tuesday approved seven hopefuls to run in next month's presidential poll, a list dominated by ultraconservatives and deemed "indefensible" by one senior official. The election-vetting Guardian Council disqualified moderate conservative Ali Larijani, in a surprise move that could clear the way for a strong run by ultraconservative judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi in the June 18 election. The announcement comes with Iran engaged in talks with world powers aimed at reviving a nuclear deal that has been on life support since former US president Donald Trump's unilateral withdrawal from it in 2018. Raisi won 38 percent of the vote in the 2017 presidential election but was defeated by Hassan Rouhani, a moderate who is constitutionally barred from holding office for three consecutive terms. "I have never found the council's decisions to be so indefensible, whether in approvals or disqualifications," said Ayatollah Sadegh Amoli Larijani, a former judiciary chief, current member of the 12-man body and brother to Ali. The cleric took to Twitter to accuse "security bodies" of increasingly influencing the vetting body through "false reports". The remarks by Amoli Larijani, also a member of the Assembly of Experts and the head of the powerful Expediency Council, who was replaced by Raisi at the helm of the judiciary in 2019, amount to rare criticism from a high-ranking establishment figure. The Guardian Council also barred firebrand former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, as it did when he registered to be a candidate in 2017. Ahmadinejad has yet to comment on his disqualification. He had said before that if not approved, he would "not participate" in the election, either by backing a candidate or voting. The list announced by the interior ministry sparked criticism from reformists and even conservatives. "I have never seen the Guardian Council criticised and blasted so much from the far right to the far left," said reformist journalist Mostafa Faghihi on Twitter. The press had widely predicted a showdown between Raisi and Larijani, who is currently an adviser to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Reformists had pinned their hopes on Eshaq Jahangiri, first-vice president to incumbent Rouhani, but he was also barred. Jahangiri said the disqualifications posed "a serious threat to public participation and fair competition," especially for reformists. Kian Abdollahi, editor-in-chief of ultraconservative Tasnim news agency, said the council's decision was not "justifiable to the public" and that "a major part" of conservatives opposed it. A record 57 percent of Iranians stayed away from legislative elections in February last year in which thousands of candidates, many of them moderates and reformists, were disqualified. Turnout is still a concern this year, with officials including the supreme leader urging Iranians to vote. The Guardian Council's decision was criticised by members of the public. The move turned the election into a mere formality, said an engineer in Tehran who only identified himself as Majid. "It used to be disguised, but it's not even disguised anymore," he told AFP. "For me, it doesn't really matter who's going to be (president), because whoever it is, nothing will change," said fitness instructor Farnoosh. The government deflected reports that Rouhani had called on Khamenei to intervene by bringing some candidates back in. "I don't have the latest information," its spokesman said. The leader had in 2005 reversed the council's decision to bar two reformist figures, Mostafa Moein and Mohsen Mehralizadeh, with the latter an approved candidate this year. The final list announcement comes as global powers meet in Vienna in efforts to bring Washington back into a deal over Iran's nuclear programme, which the US left in 2018. The withdrawal under Trump and re-imposition of US sanctions led to Iran stepping up its nuclear activities. Larijani, who was a key domestic backer of the 2015 deal, conceded his disqualification on Tuesday. "Dear nation of Iran; now that the election was decided to be so, I have fulfilled my duty," he wrote on Twitter. "I am content with God's will," he wrote. Many political figures and analysts said there was hardly a competition any more, as the disqualification of Raisi's main rivals should allow him an easy victory. They include ex-Revolutionary Guards chief Major General Mohsen Rezai, ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, and ultraconservative MPs Alireza Zakani and Amirhossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi. The list also includes reformist ex-vice president Mehralizadeh, and central bank governor Abdolnasser Hemmati, deemed close to the left.

News article:
TEHRAN: Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Thursday urged Iranians to ignore calls to boycott next month’s presidential election, after several hopefuls were barred from running against ultraconservative candidates. Iranians are set to elect a successor to President Hassan Rouhani on June 18 amid widespread discontent over a deep economic and social crisis. The exiled opposition has for months run a campaign on social media networks calling on Iranians to stay away from the polls, using hashtags in Persian such as #NototheIslamicRepublic. “Do not pay attention to those who are campaigning and saying it is useless to go to the polls and that one should not go to the polls,” Khamenei told lawmakers in a speech via videoconference, according to his official Instagram account. His declaration comes a day after Rouhani said he had asked the supreme leader to intervene to ensure greater “competition” in the presidential election. Iran’s candidate-vetting Guardian Council on Tuesday approved seven mainly ultraconservative hopefuls to run in the election and disqualified moderate conservative Ali Larijani. The council — a conservative-dominated, unelected body — also barred firebrand former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Its decision appears to clear the way for a strong run by ultraconservative judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi. Rouhani is constitutionally barred from running for a third consecutive term. A record 57 percent of Iranians stayed away from legislative elections in February last year after thousands of candidates, many of them moderates and reformists, were disqualified. The poll comes at a critical time for Iran amid talks with world powers aimed at reviving a nuclear deal that has been on life support since former US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018.

News article:
TEHRAN: Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Thursday urged Iranians to ignore calls to boycott next month’s presidential election, after several hopefuls were barred from running against ultraconservative candidates. Iranians are set to elect a successor to President Hassan Rouhani on June 18 amid widespread discontent over a deep economic and social crisis. The exiled opposition has for months run a campaign on social media networks calling on Iranians to stay away from the polls, using hashtags in Persian such as #NototheIslamicRepublic. “Do not pay attention to those who are campaigning and saying it is useless to go to the polls and that one should not go to the polls,” Khamenei told lawmakers in a speech via videoconference, according to his official Instagram account. His declaration comes a day after Rouhani said he had asked the supreme leader to intervene to ensure greater “competition” in the presidential election. Iran’s candidate-vetting Guardian Council on Tuesday approved seven mainly ultraconservative hopefuls to run in the election and disqualified moderate conservative Ali Larijani. The council — a conservative-dominated, unelected body — also barred firebrand former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Its decision appears to clear the way for a strong run by ultraconservative judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi. Rouhani is constitutionally barred from running for a third consecutive term. A record 57 percent of Iranians stayed away from legislative elections in February last year after thousands of candidates, many of them moderates and reformists, were disqualified. The poll comes at a critical time for Iran amid talks with world powers aimed at reviving a nuclear deal that has been on life support since former US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018.

The Guardian Council has barred establishment candidate Ali Larijani from the presidential race. That says a lot about Iran's political culture. During a virtual session with Iranian MPs on Thursday, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei defended the Guardian Council decision to exclude a spate of moderates — including Ali Larijani — from the presidential election on June 18. The Guardian Council has the prerogative to vet all candidates based on their ideological stance and loyalty to Iran's political order. Council members not only excluded former parliamentary speaker Larijani, but also acting Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri. The decision sparked fierce criticism, especially on social media. Ali Larijani has been squeezed out of the presidential race Image: picture-alliance/AP Photo/V. Salemi In a letter to Khamenei, President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday urged a rethink on the mater. According to news agency AFP, Rouhani stressed that "at its heart, elections are about competition; if you take that away, they are like a corpse." Sadiq Larijani defends brother The radical move was also condemned by Ali Larijani's brother Sadiq Larijani, who has served on the Guardian Council since 2001, and headed Iran's judicial system between 2009 and 2019. Ali Larijani was the moderate candidate thought to have the best chances of succeeding President Rouhani. Sadiq Larijani took to Twitter to complain that his brother had been disqualified "based on false information from the secret service." Indeed, rumors have circulated that Ali Larijani's daughter Fatemeh has emigrated to the US. Apparently she does not, however, possess US citizenship, which would have disqualified her father from the presidential race. Sadiq Larijani, meanwhile, asserts "falsehoods" had been deliberately spread among the Guardian Council to discredit his brother. Reformists squeezed out of race Iran's Guardian Council is comprised of twelve members. Six members ― all Islamic clerics ― are appointed by supreme leader Ali Khamenei. The remaining six are lawyers, suggested by the head of Iran's judiciary and approved by parliament. Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei can appoint and dismiss six members of the powerful Guardian Council Image: Irna One of the candidates running for the presidency is Iran's judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi. With Larijani gone, his chances have risen substantially. "Larijani's surprising disqualification will have far-reaching consequences," Iran analysist Ali Afshari told DW's Farsi service. Afshari, who lives in US exile, was a supporter of Iran's more reform-oriented forces. He was arrested on several occasions and sentenced to jailtime, most recently in 2005, when he called for an election boycott after the Guardian Council disqualified moderates from running. Afshari said Larijani's disqualification dashes all hope that elections will help reform Iran's political system. It showed, he told DW, that "the heart of Iran's political system, overseen by its religious leader, expects complete loyalty and does not tolerate criticism." Too outspoken? Ali Larijani's rejection illustrates just how intolerant the Guardian Council is of dissenting views. It's all the more surprising in light of Larijani's background. His father is late Grand Ayatollah Haj Mirza Hashem Amoli, after all. Moreover, Larijani is married to the daughter of influential Shia scholar Ayatollah Morteza Motahhari. He is also an aide to Khamenei, albeit not a member of his close circle. "This is primarily because he never spoke out against opposition figures Mehdi Karroubi and Mir Hossein Mousavi, who were placed under house arrest in 2010," Afshari told DW. Larijani also "openly criticized Ebrahim Raisi and members of the Revolutionary Guard."

And he supports reviving the Iran nuclear deal. Ali Fathollah-Nedschad, a political scientist and Iran expert, told DW that by excluding moderate candidates like Larijani, Iran is headed for a sham election that is even less believable than previous polls. With a hardline president in office, he said, Iran's hardline Revolutionary Guards would gain yet more influence in the country. This, by extension, would also enhance their impact on the economy. Iran's hardliners are looking to take over all power in Iran — regardless of how disappointed the electorate is, or how low voter turnout will be, for that matter. One survey shows that it could stand at a mere 30%. This article has been adapted from German.

Embed from Getty Images The decision by Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, not to interfere with the “Guardian Council” decision and to keep the list of the presidential candidates intact, guarantees the election of a conservative candidate for president of Iran. Hassan Rouhani’s presidency seems to have sharpened the understanding of how well a president who is familiar with Iran’s political system – especially one supported by Rouhani such as Ali Larigny – can be a “bone in the throat” that could impede significant moves the leader is seeking to promote, especially preparing the ground for selecting his successor. The role of president in Iran is not symbolic or negligible in Iranian politics. Although it is Iran’s leader who makes the vast majority of strategic decisions in the country, the president who heads the government, thus allowing the supreme leader to address the more significant issues (in his view) and especially the spiritual guidance of his Shi’ite loyalists. Sometimes the fact that the president did not come from classical conservative circles (such as Khatami, Ahmadinejad, and certainly Rouhani) enabled Khamenei to roll the blame on the president regarding Iran’s problems. However, the upcoming Iranian presidential elections to be held on June 18th are unusual. Although Iran’s supreme leader could overturn the decisions of the Guardian Council (which aims to “screen” disloyal candidates ), he preferred not to intervene in this decision. Thus, the fact that there are only conservative candidate will significantly increase the alienation between the Iranian regime and the population. In addition, the Iranian leader will find it difficult to find a non-conservative “scapegoat” to pin the blame on the state of the Iranian economy, for example. However, Khamenei seems willing to take the risk because of the fact that these elections are crucial for the question of Khamenei’s successor. Khamenei is 81, has been suffering from cancer for years and talk of possible candidates to replace him has begun to proliferate in recent years. Khamenei assume that In order to ensure an inheritance process in which his candidate is elected, he must place conservative candidates at the main decision points in Iran. Thus, it seems that in the upcoming presidential elections, Ibrahim Raisi, head of Iran’s judiciary, who is supposed to be the next leader or at the very least promote the candidacy of Khamenei’s candidacy (his son MUjtaba, or another conservative candidate) will probably win. One main reason behind the regime’s decision to prevent a “moderate conservative” candidate from being presented is related to the concerns that another loss by Raisi (like in the 2017 elections) would cause him to lose all public legitimacy to replace Khamenei, severely undermining the legitimacy of the conservatives and even Khamenei himself, who did not hide his support for him. Advertisement In addition, Khamenei may be concerned that as he gets older, his abilities to withstand the surge of attempts by Rouhani and his men to get closer to the West are weakening, so he must make sure that, in the long term, the Islamic revolution will not change its nature. As for Israel, this is supposedly excellent news, Raisi’s election prevents any thoughts in the West about a possible change taking place in Iran, determines the regime’s dogmatic view, and strengthens those who oppose any contact with Tehran. In addition, it is important to note that Khamenei’s conduct increases dissatisfaction among the population in Iran, and along with the dire economic situation, the chances of renewed demonstrations in the country increase. On the other hand, it is important to note that Raisi’s expected election and the expected weakening of the moderate camp ensures that Iran will continue its dogmatic policy vis-à-vis Israel, And even escalating its actions in a way that could lead the two countries into an inevitable confrontation.the fact that there will be no one in the Iranian leadership who can stand against the IRGC deeply troubling and could lead Iran to make more “courageous” decisions. Bottom line, Khamenei’s desire to dominate Iran’s political system before the twilight of his rule has pushed him not to interfere in the Guardian Council’s decision, and to leave the presidential elections to conservative candidates only. This decision will help Israel in its massaging campaign against Iran, but without proper Checks and balances in the Iranian leadership, the chances of direct confrontation between Israel and Iran are increasing.

News article:
Iran regime doing all it can to ensure Raisi becomes president Dr. Majid Rafizadeh Iranian Presidential candidate Ebrahim Raisi speaks during a campaign meeting at the Mosalla mosque in Tehran, Iran, May 16, 2017. (Reuters) Short Url https://arab.news/mvdsr In spite of the Iranian regime’s claims that it holds democratic presidential elections, the system is fundamentally an authoritarian one disguised as a democracy. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in February boasted about the regime’s political system and the people’s important role in influencing and shaping the political establishment. He said: “The Islamic revolution transformed the rule of a country from a despotic monarchy into a popular, democratic republic run by the people. Today, the nation of Iran rules over its own destiny. It is the people who choose. They may make a right choice or a wrong choice, but it is they who choose. This is very important.” But the reality is that ordinary people do not run the system in Iran and they have little to no influence in choosing who runs the country. To make it clear, the supreme leader is not an elected individual. How can a country be democratic, as Khamenei claims, when people cannot choose the overall leader, who enjoys the final say over the nation’s domestic and foreign policy issues and who is the chief of Iran’s military institutions, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), its elite branch the Quds Force, and the paramilitary group the Basij? Since the unelected supreme leader appoints the IRGC’s senior generals and the head of the judiciary, the regime’s military and judicial apparatuses also have a distinctly undemocratic character. What remains to be examined in the system are the positions of the president and the parliamentarians. Article 6 of Iran’s constitution stipulates: “In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the country’s affairs must be administered by reliance on the public vote, and through elections. These will include the election of the president, the deputies of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the members of the councils, and other such institutions, or through a referendum in such instances as are determined in other articles of this document.” But the Iranian regime has a solution to circumvent this: By presenting a facade of democratic elections while effectively eliminating people’s influence in choosing their president and members of the parliament. This is carried out by the regime’s clerical body, the Guardian Council. The Guardian Council is an unelected body of 12 officials, six of whom are appointed directly by the supreme leader and six indirectly. The latter six are nominated by the head of the judiciary, who is himself appointed by the supreme leader. The Guardian Council has a history of arbitrarily disqualifying reform-minded candidates, women and those who are perceived as disloyal to the principles of the state and the Islamic revolution from running for office. The authority to do so is granted by the constitution, which states: “The qualifications of the candidates for presidency, with respect to the conditions set forth by the constitution, must be confirmed by the Guardian Council prior to the general elections and approved by the leader for the first term.” As a result, people only get to choose between a few individuals selected by the regime. Despite this, Khamenei last month insisted that Iran’s elections are flawless, saying: “All elections held by the Islamic Republic have been totally flawless. There might have been certain issues and offenses, but none of them had a significant impact on the result of elections. Those who raise fraud claims do so because of being defeated.” Of course, it should not come as a surprise that, from the perspective of Iran’s supreme leader, the elections are flawless, as he can pick the candidates he wants to be president. Anyone who might have had a chance of defeating Khamenei’s pick for president has been disqualified. Dr. Majid Rafizadeh For this year’s presidential election, which will take place on June 18, the regime has disqualified anyone who might have had a chance of defeating Ebrahim Raisi, who is Khamenei’s pick for president. The Guardian Council has even disqualified top regime insiders such as Ali Larijani, not because it questions their loyalty to the supreme leader and the revolutionary ideals of the Islamic Republic, but simply because Khamenei seems to want someone else to be president of Iran this time. The regime is cognizant of the fact that Raisi is extremely unpopular in Iran — he lost the previous election to the so-called moderate Hassan Rouhani by a landslide. Rouhani received about 23.5 million of the 41 million votes cast, while Raisi received 15.7 million. This time around, the regime does not want to risk Raisi suffering another defeat. For one thing, Khamenei is 82 years old and it is believed that he sees Raisi as the perfect cleric to succeed him. In addition, at these critical times, when people’s frustration toward the regime has reached its peak, the hard-liners not only want to control the judicial and legislative branches, but also the presidential office. Khamenei and the senior cadre of the IRGC believe they can suppress opposition more effectively and end the growing power struggle between the moderates and the hard-liners by having control of all branches of the Islamic Republic. In a nutshell, the Iranian regime is paving the way for Khamenei’s pick, Raisi, to become the next president. Dr. Majid Rafizadeh is a Harvard-educated Iranian-American political scientist.

This handout photo provided by the office of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Friday shows him addressing the nation during a live TV speech on the occasion of the 32nd death anniversary of late supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (AFP photo) TEHRAN — Iran's supreme leader on Friday urged voters to turn out for this month's presidential election, warning that staying away would mean doing the work of the "enemies of Islam". Iranians are set to elect a successor to President Hassan Rouhani on June 18 amid widespread discontent over a deep economic and social crisis. "Some want to give up the duty to participate in the election with absurd reasons," Khamenei said, in a televised speech. "It is the will of the enemies, the enemies of Iran, the enemies of Islam and the enemies of religious democracy." The presidential election campaign kicked off on May 28, without fanfare and in an atmosphere of indifference, as many say the result is a foregone conclusion. Khamenei last week made similar calls urging people not to heed calls to boycott the poll. The opposition based outside Iran is running a campaign on social media networks calling for people to stay away from the polls, using hashtags in Farsi such as #NototheIslamicRepublic. "It has been said that some people are reluctant to go to the ballot box due to the pressures on their livelihoods, which we all know and experience," Khamenei said, adding that such problems are solved "by making the right choice, not by not choosing". He also quoted the Islamic republic's late founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, saying that, under certain circumstances, to abstain from voting is "one of the worst deadly sins". Iran's conservative-dominated Guardian Council approved seven candidates — five ultraconservative and two reformists — to run from a field of about 600 hopefuls. Ultraconservative judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi, who took 38 per cent of the vote in the 2017 presidential election, is widely seen as a favourite. Rouhani, who is constitutionally barred from running for a third consecutive term, has warned of the risk of low turnout. A record 57 per cent of Iranians stayed away from parliamentary elections in February last year in which thousands of candidates, many of them moderates and reformists, were barred from running. The election comes at a critical time amid talks with world powers aimed at reviving a 2015 nuclear deal that offered sanctions relief in return for Iran's agreement to tight controls on its nuclear programme. The accord has been on life support since then-US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018, and reimposed crippling sanctions.

News article:
Asharq Al-Awsat Iran held a final presidential debate Saturday that showed the fissures within the country’s politics, as hardliners referred to those seeking ties to the West as “infiltrators” and the race’s two other candidates brought up the unrest that surrounded Tehran’s disputed 2009 election. Analysts and state-linked polling put hardline judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi as the clear front-runner in Friday’s upcoming vote, with the public now largely hostile to the relative moderate President Hassan Rouhani after the collapse of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. But that didn’t stop Rouhani’s former Central Bank chief Abdolnasser Hemmati from harshly criticizing Raisi, at one point getting up from his chair to hand him a list he described as naming individuals who haven’t paid back huge loans from state banks. He again tried to link Raisi to former President Donald Trump, whose decision to unilaterally withdraw America from Iran’s nuclear deal has seen the country crushed by sanctions. “Mr. Raisi, you and your friends have played in Trump’s ground with your extremist policies,” Hemmati said. For his part, Raisi called Hemmati’s move a stunt and said he’d make sure the government returns to the nuclear deal. The deal “would not be executed by you, it needs a powerful government to do this,” Raisi said. The election Friday will see voters pick a candidate to replace Rouhani, who is term limited from running again. The vote comes amid tensions with the West as negotiations continue to try and resuscitate the nuclear deal, which saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The debate took on the pattern of the previous ones, with hardliners focusing their criticism on Hemmati as a stand-in for Rouhani. Hard-liner Alireza Zakani went as far to accuse Hemmati of committing a “huge treason” by sharing financial information to the International Monetary Fund. Hardline former Revolutionary Guard chief Mohsen Rezaei described the Rouhani government as being run by “infiltrators.” Hemmati has raised eyebrows in recent days after telling The Associated Press in an interview he’d be potentially willing to speak with President Joe Biden. He also warned that without deals with the wider world, Iran’s economy would see no growth. “What will happen if the hardliners have power?” Hemmati asked. “I tell you there is going to be more sanctions with global consensus.” It remains unclear if the debates will affect voters’ opinions. The state-linked Iranian Student Polling Agency suggested just 37% of Iranian adults watched the second debate. There also remains the larger concern about turnout in the election. Officials in the past have pointed to turnout as a sign of popular support for Iran’s theocratic government. As of now, ISPA estimates turnout will be around 41% of Iran’s over 59 million eligible voters. That would the lowest percentage since Iran’s 1979 revolution. ISPA polling also puts Raisi as the front-runner with enough of a percentage to avoid a runoff. But unlike the earlier debates, both Hemmati and an inconspicuous reformist candidate named Mohsen Mehralizadeh brought up mass protests that directly challenged the government. Mehralizadeh at one point asked Raisi to intervene with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to pardon people still held after nationwide demonstrations in November 2019 over price rises of state-subsidized gasoline. Those demonstrations ended with one lawmaker suggesting 7,000 people had been arrested. Amnesty International put the death toll from the violence at at least 208, with the rights group saying security forces killed demonstrators. Iran has yet to offer any definitive account of what happened. Responding later to Mehralizadeh, Raisi said most of those arrested “have been pardoned by the supreme leader, except those who had relations with other countries or had other issues.” He offered no figures for those pardoned and those still detained. The 2019 demonstrations were the deadliest since Iran’s 2009 presidential vote that saw hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected amid a disputed result that gave rise to the Green Movement protests. “What happened to our youth during these 12 years that changed their chants from ‘Where is my vote?’” to ‘No way I’m voting?’” Hemmati asked at one point.

Asharq Al-Awsat Iran held a final presidential debate Saturday that showed the fissures within the country’s politics, as hardliners referred to those seeking ties to the West as “infiltrators” and the race’s two other candidates brought up the unrest that surrounded Tehran’s disputed 2009 election. Analysts and state-linked polling put hardline judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi as the clear front-runner in Friday’s upcoming vote, with the public now largely hostile to the relative moderate President Hassan Rouhani after the collapse of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. But that didn’t stop Rouhani’s former Central Bank chief Abdolnasser Hemmati from harshly criticizing Raisi, at one point getting up from his chair to hand him a list he described as naming individuals who haven’t paid back huge loans from state banks. He again tried to link Raisi to former President Donald Trump, whose decision to unilaterally withdraw America from Iran’s nuclear deal has seen the country crushed by sanctions. “Mr. Raisi, you and your friends have played in Trump’s ground with your extremist policies,” Hemmati said. For his part, Raisi called Hemmati’s move a stunt and said he’d make sure the government returns to the nuclear deal. The deal “would not be executed by you, it needs a powerful government to do this,” Raisi said. The election Friday will see voters pick a candidate to replace Rouhani, who is term limited from running again. The vote comes amid tensions with the West as negotiations continue to try and resuscitate the nuclear deal, which saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The debate took on the pattern of the previous ones, with hardliners focusing their criticism on Hemmati as a stand-in for Rouhani. Hard-liner Alireza Zakani went as far to accuse Hemmati of committing a “huge treason” by sharing financial information to the International Monetary Fund. Hardline former Revolutionary Guard chief Mohsen Rezaei described the Rouhani government as being run by “infiltrators.” Hemmati has raised eyebrows in recent days after telling The Associated Press in an interview he’d be potentially willing to speak with President Joe Biden. He also warned that without deals with the wider world, Iran’s economy would see no growth. “What will happen if the hardliners have power?” Hemmati asked. “I tell you there is going to be more sanctions with global consensus.” It remains unclear if the debates will affect voters’ opinions. The state-linked Iranian Student Polling Agency suggested just 37% of Iranian adults watched the second debate. There also remains the larger concern about turnout in the election. Officials in the past have pointed to turnout as a sign of popular support for Iran’s theocratic government. As of now, ISPA estimates turnout will be around 41% of Iran’s over 59 million eligible voters. That would the lowest percentage since Iran’s 1979 revolution. ISPA polling also puts Raisi as the front-runner with enough of a percentage to avoid a runoff. But unlike the earlier debates, both Hemmati and an inconspicuous reformist candidate named Mohsen Mehralizadeh brought up mass protests that directly challenged the government. Mehralizadeh at one point asked Raisi to intervene with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to pardon people still held after nationwide demonstrations in November 2019 over price rises of state-subsidized gasoline. Those demonstrations ended with one lawmaker suggesting 7,000 people had been arrested. Amnesty International put the death toll from the violence at at least 208, with the rights group saying security forces killed demonstrators. Iran has yet to offer any definitive account of what happened. Responding later to Mehralizadeh, Raisi said most of those arrested “have been pardoned by the supreme leader, except those who had relations with other countries or had other issues.” He offered no figures for those pardoned and those still detained. The 2019 demonstrations were the deadliest since Iran’s 2009 presidential vote that saw hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected amid a disputed result that gave rise to the Green Movement protests. “What happened to our youth during these 12 years that changed their chants from ‘Where is my vote?’” to ‘No way I’m voting?’” Hemmati asked at one point.

News article:
Asharq Al-Awsat Iran's ex-parliament speaker Ali Larijani on Saturday demanded an explanation of why he was barred from running in next week's presidential poll but was promptly rebuffed by the election watchdog. The moderate conservative was disqualified by the powerful Guardian Council in a surprise move that leaves judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi, an ultraconservative, the clear favorite in the June 18 election. Larijani called on Twitter on the Guardian Council to "officially and publicly disclose all the reasons" for his disqualification as reports on him and his family had been "proven to be false". The council's spokesman in response said the law does not mandate the body to explain its reasoning in public. The vetting process is carried out using "adequate and trustable documents", Abbas Ali Kadkhodaee said in a tweet reported by local agencies. "The presidential election law has not specified anything regarding protesting disqualifications and public disclosure of their reasons," he said. The conservative-dominated, unelected council has approved seven candidates, five of them ultraconservatives, to run in the election from a field of about 600 hopefuls. In addition to Larijani, who serves as advisor to supreme leader Ali Khamenei, it also barred first vice-president Eshaq Jahangiri and firebrand former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The disqualifications have unleashed a flood of criticism, including from a member of the 12-man council. Sadegh Amoli Larijani, a former judiciary chief and brother to the ex-speaker, said "security bodies" were influencing the council's decisions through "false reports". President Hassan Rouhani, who is constitutionally barred from running for a third consecutive term, said last month he had sent a letter to Khamenei asking him to intervene and ensure greater "competition" in the election. The supreme leader in a May 27 speech urged voters to ignore boycott calls but turned a deaf ear to criticism of the vetting process. A week later, however, he said some candidates had been treated "unjustly" as "they and their families were accused of false things", without giving names. The Guardian Council said "false reports" had not influenced its decisions.

News article:
Saeed Mohammad, a former Revolutionary Guards general, registers as a candidate for the presidential election at the Interior Ministry, in Tehran, Iran May 11, 2021. WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS Asharq Al-Awsat Iran's supreme leader urged voters on Wednesday to turn out in large numbers for the June 18 presidential election, saying such a show of strength would reduce foreign pressure on the country. Two hardliners and one moderate quit the field of seven officially permitted candidates on Wednesday, leaving what is shaping into a straightforward contest between the hardline head of the judiciary and a moderate former head of the central bank. Judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi, 60, an ally of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, is widely tipped as the favorite to succeed Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist stepping down after two terms. "In less than 48 hours, a crucial event will take place in the country... By your presence and vote, you actually determine the fate of the country, in all major issues," Khamenei said in a televised speech. Under Iran's ruling system, the supreme leader has the final say over state affairs, while the elected president governs the country day-to-day. Last month, the hardline Guardian Council disqualified several prominent moderate and conservative candidates, leaving a field dominated by hardliners, with Abdolnasser Hemmati, who stood down as central bank chief to run, as Raisi's main moderate challenger. Wednesday's announcement that former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili and hardline lawmaker Alireza Zakani had dropped out will help consolidate the hardline vote behind Raisi. Moderate Mohsen Mehralizadeh also stood aside in a boost for Hemmati. Two other hardline candidates remain on the ballot, though they could step aside or back Raisi before Friday's vote. The restricted field may further dim the clerical establishment's hopes of a high turnout amid growing popular frustration over economic hardship and political restrictions. Some prominent pro-reform politicians in Iran and activists abroad have called for an election boycott, and the hashtag #NoToIslamicRepublic has been widely tweeted by Iranians inside and outside the country in the past weeks. Official opinion polls suggest turnout could be as low as 41%, significantly lower than in past elections. The election comes as Iran is negotiating in Vienna with world powers to revive a 2015 deal under which it agreed to curbs on its nuclear program in return for the lifting of international sanctions. US President Joe Biden hopes to revive the agreement, which his predecessor Donald Trump abandoned. Although the agreement was a signature achievement of outgoing president Rouhani, the election is not expected to have a major impact on Iran's negotiating position, which is set by Khamenei. But a strong mandate for Raisi could strengthen Khamenei's hand at home, and affect the search for an eventual successor to the 82-year-old supreme leader, in power for 32 years. "If the new president is elected by a significant majority of the votes, he will be a powerful president and can carry out great tasks," Khamenei said. "If we have a fall in the election turnout, we will have an increase of pressure from our enemies."

News article:
On the eve of Iran's presidential election, expected to hand victory to the ultraconservative cleric Ebrahim Raisi, the candidate-vetting Guardian Council insisted Thursday that "the political contest is serious". "The media and the people have testified that this is a good competition," said the head of the 12-member council, Abbas Ali Kadkhodaee, a day before almost 60 million voters are asked to head to the ballots. Three televised debates between the seven candidates, all men, who were approved by the unelected body of jurists and clerics, had shown that "the political competition is serious," Kadkhodaee told a news conference. The vote Friday will choose a successor to Iran's moderate President Hassan Rouhani, who cannot run again now after serving two consecutive four-year terms, and who leaves office in August. Turnout is expected to be low in a country where many have been demoralised by years of painful economic crisis that was brought on by a crippling US sanctions regime and worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic. "I left my main job because I could not pay the rent for my shop, and my (former) employees are now jobless," lamented Tehran resident Nasrollah, who said he had been a car mechanic for 47 years. "I have no money. All families are now facing an economic problem. How can we vote for these people who did this to us? It's not right." The election comes as Tehran holds renewed talks with world powers to revive a battered 2015 nuclear deal, which the United States unilaterally withdrew from three years ago under then president Donald Trump. Ultimate power in Iran lies with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but the president has significant influence on issues from industrial policy to foreign affairs. Many voters were dismayed however when a field of almost 600 hopefuls for the presidency was reduced to just seven candidates by the Guardian Council. Among the prominent figures barred from running were former parliament speaker Ali Larijani, who demanded that the council "officially and publicly disclose all the reasons" for his disqualification. Rouhani later said he had urged greater "competition" in a letter to the supreme leader, who acknowledged that some candidates had been treated "unjustly" as "they and their families were accused of false things", without giving names. The field was further reduced Wednesday when three of the seven candidates dropped out, shortly before the election campaign ended at 7:00 am (0230 GMT) Thursday. The only reformist left in the race against Raisi and two other ultraconservatives is the relatively low-profile central bank chief Abdolnasser Hemmati. Kadkhodaee said Thursday that the candidates were vetted according to "the electoral law" and that "the Guardian Council has no political views".

But some disillusioned Iranians said they planned to stay away from the polls. Maryam, an employee, said that "not voting is a form of protest".

News article:
On the eve of Iran's presidential election, expected to hand victory to the ultraconservative cleric Ebrahim Raisi, the candidate-vetting Guardian Council insisted Thursday that "the political contest is serious". "The media and the people have testified that this is a good competition," said the head of the 12-member council, Abbas Ali Kadkhodaee, a day before almost 60 million voters are asked to head to the ballots. Three televised debates between the seven candidates, all men, who were approved by the unelected body of jurists and clerics, had shown that "the political competition is serious," Kadkhodaee told a news conference. The vote Friday will choose a successor to Iran's moderate President Hassan Rouhani, who cannot run again now after serving two consecutive four-year terms, and who leaves office in August. Turnout is expected to be low in a country where many have been demoralised by years of painful economic crisis that was brought on by a crippling US sanctions regime and worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic. "I left my main job because I could not pay the rent for my shop, and my (former) employees are now jobless," lamented Tehran resident Nasrollah, who said he had been a car mechanic for 47 years. "I have no money. All families are now facing an economic problem. How can we vote for these people who did this to us? It's not right." The election comes as Tehran holds renewed talks with world powers to revive a battered 2015 nuclear deal, which the United States unilaterally withdrew from three years ago under then president Donald Trump. Ultimate power in Iran lies with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but the president has significant influence on issues from industrial policy to foreign affairs. Many voters were dismayed however when a field of almost 600 hopefuls for the presidency was reduced to just seven candidates by the Guardian Council. Among the prominent figures barred from running were former parliament speaker Ali Larijani, who demanded that the council "officially and publicly disclose all the reasons" for his disqualification. Rouhani later said he had urged greater "competition" in a letter to the supreme leader, who acknowledged that some candidates had been treated "unjustly" as "they and their families were accused of false things", without giving names. The field was further reduced Wednesday when three of the seven candidates dropped out, shortly before the election campaign ended at 7:00 am (0230 GMT) Thursday. The only reformist left in the race against Raisi and two other ultraconservatives is the relatively low-profile central bank chief Abdolnasser Hemmati. Kadkhodaee said Thursday that the candidates were vetted according to "the electoral law" and that "the Guardian Council has no political views". Raisi, Iran's judiciary chief who dresses in a black turban and religious robe, belongs to the ultraconservative camp that most deeply distrusts the United States, labelled the "Great Satan" and the "Global Arrogance" in official rhetoric. He has been mentioned in Iranian media as a possible successor to Khamenei, who turns 82 in July.

The image shows Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is the Supreme Leader of Iran. The news events set is about the Iranian presidential election, which is being held on June 18, 2021. Khamenei is the head of the Guardian Council, which is a 12-member body that vets candidates for the presidency. The Guardian Council has been criticized for disqualifying many candidates for the presidency, including former parliament speaker Ali Larijani. Khamenei has also been criticized for his role in the suppression of political freedoms in Iran. In a televised speech on Wednesday, Khamenei urged voters to turn out in droves to elect "a powerful president", warning that "the Satanic power centres of the world" are trying to undermine the ballot. The image of Khamenei is relevant to the news events set because it shows the person who is at the center of the controversy over the Iranian presidential election.

He then served as deputy chief justice and as attorney general before he assumed his current post as Chief Justice of Iran, a position he was slammed for primarily because of the multiple allegations of human rights abuses and the repression of dissidents. Now, many are worried that if he ends up winning the race, the repression will only get worse. Change Is Nowhere Near In Israel, authorities are also watching the developments in Iran with great interest. For them, whoever comes to power in Tehran is an indication of the route the Islamic Republic will be taking on matters pertaining to its nuclear programme, which the Jewish state views as the prime threat to its security. But Dr. Raz Zimmt, a research fellow at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies and one of the leading experts on Iran, says the election of Raisi will not change much for Iran, the Jewish state, the region or the world. "Most responsibilities in Iran belong to the Supreme Leader [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - ed.], so the President, even if a more pragmatic one is elected, will not be able to change much". Iran has witnessed that in the past eight years, during the tenure of current President Hassan Rouhani, believed to be a rather reformist politician. Internationally, his name has been associated with attempts to solve Tehran's nuclear issue and rescue the economy from the suffocating impact of Western sanctions. In domestic affairs, he has been linked to the attempts to allow civilian freedoms. But those efforts have been largely unfruitful due to the fierce opposition of the conservative establishment. And with Raisi in power, that hardline approach is only expected to grow. "Domestically, we might see even more repression. Raisi's approach is similar to that of Khamenei and that means that we will not see a change in the status quo when it comes to social media or civil society." Nor will there be a change in Iran's foreign policy, especially vis-a-vis the attitude towards the US and the West or around its nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile system, believes the expert. And this means that Tehran's atomic programme will go on, despite the various reservations of the international community. In the West, Israel and the Gulf, some are concerned that Iran is developing weapons of mass destruction under the pretext of a civilian nuclear programme, allegations that Iran has repeatedly denied. Western powers, including the US, are currently leading a series of negotiations with Iran in Vienna, with the aim to resume the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that Washington left unilaterally in 2018 and that would allow the West to supervise Tehran's nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. An Opportunity for Israel? If Raisi comes to power, Zimmt warns that those negotiations could become even more challenging, given his hardline approach on the issue. "For Raisi, the top priority is to steer the country through its economic crisis. But his approach is different than that of Rouhani. Whereas the current President wanted to remove Western sanctions through expanding Iran's relations with Europe, Russia and China, Raisi will avoid pushing the country towards the West and is likely to encourage domestic industry instead." For the West, such an Iranian approach could mean that its relations with the Islamic Republic could go back to square one. But for Israel, says Zimmt, that stance of Raisi could present an opportunity. "If Raisi comes to power, it might be easier for Israel to mobilise the international community against Iran, just as it was during the tenure of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. But if the nuclear deal is reached, the amount of pressure applied will be significantly lower than what we saw back then."

The image shows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is not directly related to the news events set. However, the overall theme of the news article is about the potential impact of Ebrahim Raisi's election as President of Iran on Iran's foreign policy, especially towards the US and the West. Netanyahu is a prominent figure in the Middle East and has been a vocal critic of Iran's nuclear program. Therefore, the image can be seen as complementary to the news events set as it provides a visual representation of one of the key players in the region who is likely to be affected by the outcome of the Iranian election.

News article:
Topic: Iran Region: Middle East Tags: IranIran ElectionsAli KhameneiIRGCEbrahim RaisiJCPOA Rushing to rejoin the JCPOA won’t change the forces that drive Iran’s nuclear program and underpin the totality of its malign behavior. But increasing economic pressure, diplomatic isolation, and attention to its direct responsibility for immeasurable suffering can. Iranian elections routinely prompt politicians and the media to speculate over whether “moderates” or “hardliners” will win control, as if the Iranian people have real choices. Anti-regime Iranians need not apply. At the end of the day, Iran’s presidents have limited ability to enact their own agendas. After all, it is the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei who sets the tone and direction of foreign and domestic policy. While he has not always been impervious to public demands for reform, Ayatollah Khamenei strongly favors a trajectory based on increasing domestic repression and confrontation with the United States, and his vision has consistently won out. This year, 592 Iranians registered to run for the presidency, but when the polls open this week, there will be just seven pre-screened and hand-selected pro-regime candidates on the ballot, including no moderates or reformists of significant national stature. Regardless of who wins, they will maintain Iran’s state sponsorship of terrorism, domestic repression, and nuclear program, as the ostensible “moderate” Hassan Rouhani did for eight years. This year, the regime has gone a step further by working to all but guarantee victory for the Supreme Leader’s preferred candidate, Ebrahim Raisi. Ayatollah Khamenei is backing Raisi—often described as a potential successor to the supreme leader—because he must preserve the regime and secure the tools for a smooth transition of power. Nothing is being left to chance, especially after Raisi’s first bid ended in a humiliating defeat in 2017, failing to garner 40 percent of the vote. The Guardian Council, a regime-aligned body that can approve or exclude candidates for office, even disqualified top regime insiders like Ali Larijani from running. In past years, Larijani’s resume of more than a decade in public life as speaker of parliament and advisor to Khamenei would have made him a formidable candidate. But he’s not a future supreme leader, and nothing is being left to chance. The regime has rigged the outcome by purging all viable rivals to Raisi, and the ultraconservative cleric will most assuredly take office. If polling is accurate, most eligible Iranians are signaling their disgust with the nakedly transparent power grab by boycotting the proceedings altogether. Raisi’s coronation is bad news for Iranians and the international community. Raisi will undoubtedly continue Khamenei’s domestic brutality, as he has been at the forefront of meting out Islamic Republic-style “justice” during his decades of service in the judiciary. Raisi ran for president—and lost—during the last round of elections in 2017 because of his involvement in the extrajudicial executions of thousands of political prisoners in the late 1980s. And since his installment as chief justice of Iran’s judiciary, human rights violations; extensive prison terms; and torture against dissidents, political prisoners, and religious minorities have increased. What was disqualifying for Raisi at the polls just four years ago is today seen as an asset. A Raisi presidency will also mean continued support for terrorist organizations and proxy wars in Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. It will mean that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, will continue to consolidate its grip on power. The IRGC already controls large swaths of the Iranian economy through front companies, benefits financially from the sale of petroleum and petrochemicals abroad, leads Iranian military operations in Iraq and Syria, trains Hamas terrorists, and controls a growing share of the Iranian nuclear program. Iran’s hardline clergy has formed an unholy alliance with the IRGC in recent years to ensure its primacy within the Iranian system, and the IRGC knows it can count on Raisi to protect its economic empire. To be clear, the rise of Raisi’s political stock has nothing to do with U.S. or European policies and everything to do with the regime’s need to sustain its grip on power. We are simply not that influential so as to determine the ebbs and flows of regime politics. But that doesn’t mean we are powerless to stymie the Khamenei-Raisi alliance. It is not hyperbole to assert that the negotiators representing Tehran in talks with the United States, Europe, China, and Russia do not have control or clear authority over the scope of Iran’s nuclear program, its pace, or how transparent the regime will be with international nuclear inspectors. The Biden administration and its European allies should be preparing to defend against a strong, deep bench of Khamenei-esque hardliners eager to undermine any accord that restores the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) inked before the next Iranian administration takes office. If a deal is not reached ahead of time, the incoming administration will be more hostile to compromise and will continue the regime’s steady march toward ever-more extreme manifestations of violence and intimidation. U.S. and European preparations should start with closing ranks to insist on clear red lines in nuclear negotiations and to maintain robust economic pressure, which is the only thing that can extract concessions from Iranian interlocutors. We must return to the principle of zero enrichment or reprocessing in light of the regime’s flagrant decision to enrich uranium beyond the needs of any civilian nuclear program, insist on full inspections and verification, resolve Possible Military Dimensions (PMD) and undeclared nuclear activity, and address Iran’s unacceptable non-nuclear behavior, including its ballistic missile program and continued facilitation of terrorism. A strategy that relies on these principles isn’t just good for U.S. national security vis-à-vis Iran; it’s good for U.S. interests globally. It will signal to rogue regimes and authoritarian leaders from Pyongyang to Beijing to Ankara and Caracas that America is going to force a hard choice: continue their malign behaviors or risk ever-deeper economic and diplomatic isolation. Many millions of Iranians in Iran and within the Iranian diaspora community would like to see the weakened regime stripped of power—Raisi’s installation into the presidency entrenches hardline control of yet another Iranian power center and moves that goal further from reality. More extreme aggression and intransigence can be expected, particularly as Raisi angles to demonstrate his bona fides as the heir apparent to Khamenei. We must be ready to provide even greater pressure on a theocratic regime built on anti-Americanism and repression. Khamenei’s ideological successors are poised to control the Islamic Republic well after Khamenei departs from the scene, whether the cynical coronation of Raisi succeeds or not. Rushing to rejoin the JCPOA won’t change the forces that drive Iran’s nuclear program and underpin the totality of its malign behavior. But increasing economic pressure, diplomatic isolation, and attention to its direct responsibility for immeasurable suffering can. Most importantly, it sends a message to the millions of Iranians who have concluded that the only way to have a voice is to boycott this illegitimate election that the United States stands with their hopes for a less repressive, less confrontational government.

Raisi will undoubtedly continue Khamenei’s domestic brutality, as he has been at the forefront of meting out Islamic Republic-style “justice” during his decades of service in the judiciary. Raisi ran for president—and lost—during the last round of elections in 2017 because of his involvement in the extrajudicial executions of thousands of political prisoners in the late 1980s. And since his installment as chief justice of Iran’s judiciary, human rights violations; extensive prison terms; and torture against dissidents, political prisoners, and religious minorities have increased. What was disqualifying for Raisi at the polls just four years ago is today seen as an asset. A Raisi presidency will also mean continued support for terrorist organizations and proxy wars in Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. It will mean that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, will continue to consolidate its grip on power. The IRGC already controls large swaths of the Iranian economy through front companies, benefits financially from the sale of petroleum and petrochemicals abroad, leads Iranian military operations in Iraq and Syria, trains Hamas terrorists, and controls a growing share of the Iranian nuclear program. Iran’s hardline clergy has formed an unholy alliance with the IRGC in recent years to ensure its primacy within the Iranian system, and the IRGC knows it can count on Raisi to protect its economic empire. To be clear, the rise of Raisi’s political stock has nothing to do with U.S. or European policies and everything to do with the regime’s need to sustain its grip on power. We are simply not that influential so as to determine the ebbs and flows of regime politics. But that doesn’t mean we are powerless to stymie the Khamenei-Raisi alliance. It is not hyperbole to assert that the negotiators representing Tehran in talks with the United States, Europe, China, and Russia do not have control or clear authority over the scope of Iran’s nuclear program, its pace, or how transparent the regime will be with international nuclear inspectors. The Biden administration and its European allies should be preparing to defend against a strong, deep bench of Khamenei-esque hardliners eager to undermine any accord that restores the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) inked before the next Iranian administration takes office. If a deal is not reached ahead of time, the incoming administration will be more hostile to compromise and will continue the regime’s steady march toward ever-more extreme manifestations of violence and intimidation. U.S. and European preparations should start with closing ranks to insist on clear red lines in nuclear negotiations and to maintain robust economic pressure, which is the only thing that can extract concessions from Iranian interlocutors. We must return to the principle of zero enrichment or reprocessing in light of the regime’s flagrant decision to enrich uranium beyond the needs of any civilian nuclear program, insist on full inspections and verification, resolve Possible Military Dimensions (PMD) and undeclared nuclear activity, and address Iran’s unacceptable non-nuclear behavior, including its ballistic missile program and continued facilitation of terrorism. A strategy that relies on these principles isn’t just good for U.S. national security vis-à-vis Iran; it’s good for U.S. interests globally. It will signal to rogue regimes and authoritarian leaders from Pyongyang to Beijing to Ankara and Caracas that America is going to force a hard choice: continue their malign behaviors or risk ever-deeper economic and diplomatic isolation. Many millions of Iranians in Iran and within the Iranian diaspora community would like to see the weakened regime stripped of power—Raisi’s installation into the presidency entrenches hardline control of yet another Iranian power center and moves that goal further from reality. More extreme aggression and intransigence can be expected, particularly as Raisi angles to demonstrate his bona fides as the heir apparent to Khamenei. We must be ready to provide even greater pressure on a theocratic regime built on anti-Americanism and repression. Khamenei’s ideological successors are poised to control the Islamic Republic well after Khamenei departs from the scene, whether the cynical coronation of Raisi succeeds or not. Rushing to rejoin the JCPOA won’t change the forces that drive Iran’s nuclear program and underpin the totality of its malign behavior. But increasing economic pressure, diplomatic isolation, and attention to its direct responsibility for immeasurable suffering can. Most importantly, it sends a message to the millions of Iranians who have concluded that the only way to have a voice is to boycott this illegitimate election that the United States stands with their hopes for a less repressive, less confrontational government.

But increasing economic pressure, diplomatic isolation, and attention to its direct responsibility for immeasurable suffering can. Iranian elections routinely prompt politicians and the media to speculate over whether “moderates” or “hardliners” will win control, as if the Iranian people have real choices. Anti-regime Iranians need not apply. At the end of the day, Iran’s presidents have limited ability to enact their own agendas. After all, it is the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei who sets the tone and direction of foreign and domestic policy. While he has not always been impervious to public demands for reform, Ayatollah Khamenei strongly favors a trajectory based on increasing domestic repression and confrontation with the United States, and his vision has consistently won out. This year, 592 Iranians registered to run for the presidency, but when the polls open this week, there will be just seven pre-screened and hand-selected pro-regime candidates on the ballot, including no moderates or reformists of significant national stature. Regardless of who wins, they will maintain Iran’s state sponsorship of terrorism, domestic repression, and nuclear program, as the ostensible “moderate” Hassan Rouhani did for eight years. This year, the regime has gone a step further by working to all but guarantee victory for the Supreme Leader’s preferred candidate, Ebrahim Raisi. Ayatollah Khamenei is backing Raisi—often described as a potential successor to the supreme leader—because he must preserve the regime and secure the tools for a smooth transition of power. Nothing is being left to chance, especially after Raisi’s first bid ended in a humiliating defeat in 2017, failing to garner 40 percent of the vote. The Guardian Council, a regime-aligned body that can approve or exclude candidates for office, even disqualified top regime insiders like Ali Larijani from running. In past years, Larijani’s resume of more than a decade in public life as speaker of parliament and advisor to Khamenei would have made him a formidable candidate. But he’s not a future supreme leader, and nothing is being left to chance. The regime has rigged the outcome by purging all viable rivals to Raisi, and the ultraconservative cleric will most assuredly take office. If polling is accurate, most eligible Iranians are signaling their disgust with the nakedly transparent power grab by boycotting the proceedings altogether. Raisi’s coronation is bad news for Iranians and the international community. Raisi will undoubtedly continue Khamenei’s domestic brutality, as he has been at the forefront of meting out Islamic Republic-style “justice” during his decades of service in the judiciary.

News article:
Iranians are heading to the polls to pick the next president of the country. Ebrahim Raisi, Iran’s judiciary chief, is expected to secure a comfortable win, with most political heavyweights barred from running. Polling stations opened across Iran on Friday, with around 60 million people eligible to vote. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was the first to cast a ballot, as he urged everyone to vote. “Each vote counts… come and vote and choose your president… this is important for the future of your country,” Khamenei said. The outgoing president, Hassan Rouhani, called on citizens to “make our friends… all Iranians happy and our enemies disappointed,” by showing a high turnout. The election is not expected to hold much intrigue, with Iran’s judiciary chief and close ally of Khamenei, Ebrahim Raisi, projected to secure a solid win. Hardliner Raisi also ran in 2017, losing by a wide margin of almost 20% to the incumbent president, Rouhani, who is barred from running again due to legal limitations allowing two consecutive four-year terms, which he has already served. Raisi is already the subject of sanctions imposed on Iran by Washington. The high-profile official was targeted by the US after he was appointed as judiciary chief in 2019, with Washington accusing him of involvement in the execution of political prisoners in the 1980s and the suppression of unrest in the late 2000s. While more than 600 people submitted bids to the Guardian Council, a 12-member panel directly under Khamenei, only seven candidates made through it. The panel disqualified political heavyweights such as hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who served as president from 2005 to 2013, as well as former parliamentary speaker, conservative Ali Larijani. Also on rt.com Iran announces 7 approved candidates for upcoming elections, ex-president Ahmadihejad barred from running The decisions of the council against some of the presidential hopefuls were criticized by Khamenei himself. The supreme leader said some of the disqualifications were unjust, urging the panel to reverse some of the decisions. “Some candidates were wronged. They were accused of untrue things that were unfortunately spread throughout the internet too. Protecting people’s honor is one of the most important issues. I call on the responsible bodies to restore their honor,” Khamenei said earlier this month. The Guardian Council, however, said its rulings were final and did not reverse any of the bans.

News article:
With the majority of votes counted, the 60-year-old arch-conservative cleric is set to succeed moderate President Hassan Rouhani. Iran's ultraconservative cleric and judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi has won the presidential election, the country's foreign minister said Saturday. Mohammad Javad Zarif made the announcement a day after Iranians voted in a contest that was marred by boycotts and a low turnout. Raisi won 62% of the vote with about 90% of ballots counted from Friday's election, poll officials said. Victory over 'enemy propaganda' Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hailed the election as a victory for the nation over "enemy propaganda." "The great winner of yesterday's elections is the Iranian nation because it has risen up once again in the face of the propaganda of the enemy's mercenary media," Khameini said. Outgoing moderate President Hassan Rouhani also said in a televised speech on Saturday that his successor had been elected, without naming the winner. "I congratulate the people on their choice," said Rouhani. "My official congratulations will come later, but we know who got enough votes in this election and who is elected today by the people." Other contestants — including two ultraconservative candidates, Mohsen Rezaei and Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, and reformist Abdolnasser Hemmati — explicitly congratulated Raisi. Raisi will succeed Rouhani, who could not run again after serving two consecutive four-year terms. He leaves office in August. Reformists banned from fielding candidates To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Low voter turnout Over 59 million Iranians were eligible to vote at home and abroad in Friday's election. In the run-up, however, Iranian opposition groups abroad and some dissidents at home had called for a boycott of the vote they see as an engineered victory for Raisi. Hundreds of moderates were barred from contesting the election by the nation's Guardian Council. Turnout appeared far lower than in Iran's last presidential election in 2017, when over 70% of eligible voters cast their ballot. Opinion polls suggested the turnout was around 44%. What do we know about Raisi? Raisi, 60, has been the head of the nation's judiciary since 2019 and belongs to the ultraconservative camp that most deeply distrusts the United States. He is notorious for his involvement as a prosecutor in the execution of thousands of political prisoners in the late 1980s. The EU and the US have imposed sanctions on Raisi for his role in the human rights violations that happened in Iran during the nationwide anti-government protests in 2019. Rights group Amnesty International on Saturday renewed a call for Raisi to be investigated for his role in human rights violations in the country. "We continue to call for Ebrahim Raisi to be investigated for his involvement in past and ongoing crimes under international law, including by states that exercise universal jurisdiction," Amnesty Secretary-General Agnes Callamard said in a statement. Raisi's win would also give more power to Iranian hard-liners amid ongoing talks in Vienna to revive the 2015 nuclear deal struck by Iran and world powers. Raisi has harshly criticized President Rouhani since the nuclear deal began to unravel under former US President Donald Trump's administration. During the election campaign, Raisi vowed to keep up the fight on graft, construct 4 million new homes for low-income families, and build "a government of the people for a strong Iran." What could a Raisi presidency mean for Iran? The election came at a critical juncture for Iran. The nation's economy is struggling to cope with the harsh US sanctions imposed by the Trump administration, after Washington left the international nuclear deal. The revival of sanctions plunged the economy into recession, and Rouhani came under fire from ultraconservatives for having trusted the West. The country of 83 million is currently blocked by the US from selling its oil to and trading with much of the world. As president, Raisi would be confronted with the nation's dire economic situation and foreign policy challenges. But even though the president has significant influence to set direction on a wide range of issues, from economic policy to foreign affairs, ultimate power in Iran lies with the supreme leader, Khamenei. Nevertheless, many observers see Raisi as a possible successor to Khamenei, who turns 82 next month, as supreme leader. sri/mm (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 aligned.

The image shows Ebrahim Raisi, the winner of the Iranian presidential election, raising his hands in victory. This is an important event, as Raisi is a hard-line cleric who is seen as close to the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. His victory is likely to have a significant impact on Iran's domestic and foreign policies.

The news events set includes two events: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's optimistic comment on the election and President Hassan Rouhani's acknowledgement of the unnamed winner. These events are both related to the image, as they show the reaction of two important Iranian figures to Raisi's victory.

The image and the news events set are therefore aligned, as they are all related to the Iranian presidential election and its aftermath.

In addition, the image is visually appealing and would likely capture the attention of readers. Therefore, I believe that the relationship between this image and the news events set is aligned.


News article:
With the majority of votes counted, the 60-year-old arch-conservative cleric is set to succeed moderate President Hassan Rouhani. Iran's ultraconservative cleric and judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi has won the presidential election, the country's foreign minister said Saturday. Mohammad Javad Zarif made the announcement a day after Iranians voted in a contest that was marred by boycotts and a low turnout. Raisi won 62% of the vote with about 90% of ballots counted from Friday's election, poll officials said. Victory over 'enemy propaganda' Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hailed the election as a victory for the nation over "enemy propaganda." "The great winner of yesterday's elections is the Iranian nation because it has risen up once again in the face of the propaganda of the enemy's mercenary media," Khameini said. Outgoing moderate President Hassan Rouhani also said in a televised speech on Saturday that his successor had been elected, without naming the winner. "I congratulate the people on their choice," said Rouhani. "My official congratulations will come later, but we know who got enough votes in this election and who is elected today by the people." Other contestants — including two ultraconservative candidates, Mohsen Rezaei and Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, and reformist Abdolnasser Hemmati — explicitly congratulated Raisi. Raisi will succeed Rouhani, who could not run again after serving two consecutive four-year terms. He leaves office in August. Reformists banned from fielding candidates To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Low voter turnout Over 59 million Iranians were eligible to vote at home and abroad in Friday's election. In the run-up, however, Iranian opposition groups abroad and some dissidents at home had called for a boycott of the vote they see as an engineered victory for Raisi. Hundreds of moderates were barred from contesting the election by the nation's Guardian Council. Turnout appeared far lower than in Iran's last presidential election in 2017, when over 70% of eligible voters cast their ballot. Opinion polls suggested the turnout was around 44%. What do we know about Raisi? Raisi, 60, has been the head of the nation's judiciary since 2019 and belongs to the ultraconservative camp that most deeply distrusts the United States. He is notorious for his involvement as a prosecutor in the execution of thousands of political prisoners in the late 1980s. The EU and the US have imposed sanctions on Raisi for his role in the human rights violations that happened in Iran during the nationwide anti-government protests in 2019. Rights group Amnesty International on Saturday renewed a call for Raisi to be investigated for his role in human rights violations in the country. "We continue to call for Ebrahim Raisi to be investigated for his involvement in past and ongoing crimes under international law, including by states that exercise universal jurisdiction," Amnesty Secretary-General Agnes Callamard said in a statement. Raisi's win would also give more power to Iranian hard-liners amid ongoing talks in Vienna to revive the 2015 nuclear deal struck by Iran and world powers. Raisi has harshly criticized President Rouhani since the nuclear deal began to unravel under former US President Donald Trump's administration. During the election campaign, Raisi vowed to keep up the fight on graft, construct 4 million new homes for low-income families, and build "a government of the people for a strong Iran." What could a Raisi presidency mean for Iran? The election came at a critical juncture for Iran. The nation's economy is struggling to cope with the harsh US sanctions imposed by the Trump administration, after Washington left the international nuclear deal. The revival of sanctions plunged the economy into recession, and Rouhani came under fire from ultraconservatives for having trusted the West. The country of 83 million is currently blocked by the US from selling its oil to and trading with much of the world. As president, Raisi would be confronted with the nation's dire economic situation and foreign policy challenges. But even though the president has significant influence to set direction on a wide range of issues, from economic policy to foreign affairs, ultimate power in Iran lies with the supreme leader, Khamenei. Nevertheless, many observers see Raisi as a possible successor to Khamenei, who turns 82 next month, as supreme leader. sri/mm (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 aligned.

The image shows Ebrahim Raisi, the winner of the Iranian presidential election, raising his hands in victory. This is an important event, as Raisi is a hard-line cleric who is seen as close to the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. His victory is likely to have a significant impact on Iran's domestic and foreign policy.

The news events set includes two events: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's optimistic comment on the election and President Hassan Rouhani's non-apologetic acknowledgment of the unnamed winner. These events are both related to the image, as they show the reaction of two important Iranian figures to Raisi's victory.

The image and the news events set are therefore aligned, as they both show important moments in the Iranian presidential election.

News article:
A woman holds a poster of Iran’s newly-elected president Ebrahim Raisi, with text in Persian reading ‘Government of the people, strong Iran’, as supporters celebrate his victory in Imam Hussein square in the capital Tehran, on Saturday (AFP photo) TEHRAN — Iran’s ultraconservatives on Sunday hailed the election victory of their candidate Ebrahim Raisi, after Washington charged the vote was unfair and Tehran’s arch-foe Israel labelled him the “most extremist” president yet. Raisi, 60, won Friday’s election in which more than half the voters stayed away after many political heavyweights had been barred from running and as an economic crisis driven by US sanctions has battered the country. An austere figure from the Shiite Muslim clerical establishment, Raisi takes over from the moderate incumbent Hassan Rouhani, who must leave office in August after eight years in power. Raisi, whose black turban signifies direct descent from Islam’s Prophet Mohammad, is seen as close to the 81-year-old supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate political power in Iran. “The Dawn of a New Era,” read the jubilant front-page headline of the conservative Resalat daily, welcoming the 62 percent win by Raisi, the head of Iran’s judiciary. Raisi was congratulated by Russia, Turkey and several Gulf states, and by Iran’s regional allies including Syrian President Bashar Assad, Lebanon’s Hizbollah and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Raisi’s victory had been widely anticipated after the Guardian Council, made up of 12 clerics and jurists, had approved just seven candidates, all men, out of a field of almost 600 hopefuls. Three of those vetted candidates dropped out two days before the vote. Iran’s moderate Jomhouri-e Eslami daily highlighted that conservatives had now cemented their hold on power, from parliament and the Guardian Council to the court system and armed forces. Using a touch of irony, its editorial said that “we, the people of Iran, owed the conservative faction a homogeneous government” and “the people have delivered”. ‘Epic’ turnout Turnout reached 48.8 per cent, a record low for a presidential poll since Iran’s 1979 revolution ousted the US-backed monarchy. The ultraconservative Kayhan daily argued that voter participation was “epic” considering the economic crisis, COVID pandemic and the “enemy’s propaganda”, referring to boycott calls from Iranian opposition groups abroad. The Resalat daily welcomed the change from the Rouhani administration which it said has been dogged by political infighting and occupied with “fruitless domestic and foreign challenges”. Rouhani’s landmark achievement was the 2015 deal with world powers under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. That deal has however been hanging by a thread since then-US president Donald Trump withdrew from it in 2018 and launched a “maximum pressure” campaign to diplomatically and economically isolate Tehran. While Iran has always denied seeking a nuclear weapon, Trump charged it was still planning to build the bomb and was destabilising the Middle East through armed proxy groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Since Trump’s successor Joe Biden took office this year, talks involving Iran and the remaining parties to the accord — Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia — have resumed in Vienna, with the US taking part indirectly. ‘Anti-Western views’ Iran’s ultraconservatives — who deeply distrust the United States, labelled the “Great Satan” in the Islamic republic — bitterly attacked Rouhani over the failing deal and for having trusted the West. But Raisi has nonetheless said Iran should keep negotiating with the aim of ending the punishing sanctions that have largely cut the country of 83 million off from global markets and financial systems. The US State Department said after Raisi’s election win that Washington would continue talks over Iran’s nuclear programme, working with its allies and partners. A spokesperson charged however that “Iranians were denied their right to choose their own leaders in a free and fair electoral process”. In Israel, which has engaged in a shadow conflict with Iran for years, foreign ministry spokesman Lior Haiat said the Islamic republic had “elected its most extremist president to date”. Raisi was “committed to Iran’s rapidly advancing military nuclear programme”, Haiat wrote on Twitter. “His election makes clear Iran’s true malign intentions, and should prompt grave concern among the international community.” Israel’s new Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said that Raisi’s election is “the last chance for the world powers to wake up before returning to the nuclear agreement and to understand who they are doing business with”. Analysts for think thank the Eurasia Group said Raisi’s election win would likely not derail the ongoing Vienna talks to salvage the nuclear deal. But they warned that “his hardline, anti-Western views are a sharp break from the more moderate stances of Rouhani and will have a significant impact on Tehran’s relationship with the outside world”. EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell, speaking about the Vienna talks, said: “We are very close... So I hope that the result of the election is not going to be the last obstacle that will ruin the negotiation process. “As far as I know... this is not going to be the case. It is not a matter of this president or another, it is the understanding of what is at stake.”

Iran Sends a Message to Biden The new president shows who really runs the Islamic Republic. https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-sends-a-message-to-biden-11624130662?mod=opinion_lead_pos1 The Islamic Republic of Iran isn’t a real democracy. But the result of Friday’s presidential election still reveals important truths about the government that the U.S. and Europe are trying to appease on nuclear weapons. Ebrahim Raisi, the country’s chief justice, won the presidency with about 62% of the vote, according to preliminary results published Saturday. Sometimes discussed as a potential successor to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei —who wields the real power in Iran, particularly over foreign affairs—Mr. Raisi had the race wrapped up before the polls opened. The Guardian Council, Iran’s election watchdog, has long barred candidates not to the Supreme Leader’s liking. But past races have been competitive and even unpredictable, giving Iranians a small voice in deciding their future. Approved candidates are always loyal to the Islamic Republic and its revolutionary ideology. But some, like lame-duck President Hassan Rouhani, spoke the language of moderation and reform even as they followed the Khamenei line. Iranians understand they live in a dictatorship but have often voted in high numbers to choose their least bad option. Initial results suggest this year’s race had turnout around 50%—down from more than 70% four years ago and the lowest of any vote since 1979. Millions decided to boycott this year’s election as the country’s already small spectrum of permissible views grew even smaller. Last month the Guardian Council culled dozens of candidates, including many ostensible centrists or reformers. Of the seven candidates approved to run, three dropped out shortly before the contest—paving the way for Mr. Raisi, who is typically described as a hard-liner or ultraconservative cleric. In 1988 Mr. Raisi facilitated the extrajudicial execution of thousands of dissidents. He later called the killings “one of the proud achievements of the system.” In 2009, during the Green Revolution after a stolen election, he served as deputy chief justice when peaceful protestors were prosecuted and sometimes given death sentences. In 2019 the Trump Administration imposed sanctions on Mr. Raisi over the myriad human-rights violations committed during his rise through the Iranian legal system. Will the Biden Administration, which has been negotiating a return to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, lift sanctions on the president-elect? Defenders of the nuclear accord argue that by leaving the deal Donald Trump weakened reformers and empowered men like Mr. Raisi. But conservative clerics have had ultimate power in Iran since the 1979 revolution. Mr. Khamenei supported the accord because it is favorable to the regime. It offers tens of billions of dollars in financial aid and trade revenue while merely delaying the day it can build a bomb. “We will be committed to the JCPOA as an agreement that was approved by the Supreme Leader,” Mr. Raisi said this month, referring to the nuclear deal’s official name. The folly of the Obama and now Biden administrations is believing that the leaders in Tehran want Iran to be a normal country. They don’t. They run a government that wants to spread its religious revolution to the rest of the world by whatever means possible. Mr. Raisi’s ascension shouts that reality from the minaret, not that the Biden Administration wants to hear it. Comments are closed.

It offers tens of billions of dollars in financial aid and trade revenue while merely delaying the day it can build a bomb. “We will be committed to the JCPOA as an agreement that was approved by the Supreme Leader,” Mr. Raisi said this month, referring to the nuclear deal’s official name. The folly of the Obama and now Biden administrations is believing that the leaders in Tehran want Iran to be a normal country. They don’t. They run a government that wants to spread its religious revolution to the rest of the world by whatever means possible. Mr. Raisi’s ascension shouts that reality from the minaret, not that the Biden Administration wants to hear it. Comments are closed.

News article:
DUBAI, June 21 (Reuters) - The election of a hardline Iranian president has so far been met with silence from Saudi Arabia, but commentators in state-controlled Saudi newspapers forecast little change in Iran's foreign policy as security hawks tighten their grip on power. Most Gulf states, including the United Arab Emirates which is also at odds with Iran, offered congratulations after judge Ebrahim Raisi, an ally of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who wields ultimate power, emerged the winner in Friday's presidential election. "After Ebrahim Raisi's win we do not expect any important changes in foreign policy since it falls under the supreme leader, and the (nuclear) deal being negotiated by (incumbent President Hassan) Rouhani's team in Vienna will go through," wrote Abdulrahman Rashed in Saudi-owned Asharq al-Awsat daily. Riyadh and its allies are eyeing the talks between global powers and Iran to revive a 2015 nuclear pact that Washington quit in 2018 and which Gulf states opposed for not addressing Tehran's missile programme and support for regional proxies. Analysts said progress in Vienna would determine momentum in direct talks between Riyadh and Tehran launched in April to contain tensions that have festered over the Yemen war and which grew following a 2019 attack on Saudi oil plants. read more "Reconciliation with Iran is possible but within a pragmatic political framework...," said Ali al-Kheshaiban in an op-ed in Al Riyadh newspaper. "The language of moderation and equivalence is the only political language capable of curbing Iran." Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in April said Riyadh wanted good ties with Tehran, adopting a more conciliatory tone as he tries to balance long-held animosity with economic considerations and bridge differences with Washington over how to tackle Tehran's regional behaviour. read more President Joe Biden, who has demanded Iran rein in its missile programme and end support for proxies, withdrew support for a military campaign led by Riyadh in Yemen against the Iran-aligned Houthis, who continue cross-border attacks on the kingdom. Saudi commentator Khaled Suleiman, writing in Okaz daily, said Washington was "turning its cheek" to Iran and should avoid making "free concessions" that embolden Tehran.

News article:
Why does Iran insist on holding presidential elections while the world watches these elections being rigged on a daily basis during the weeks that precede the day of the vote? The elections’ results were determined weeks before they were held, not because of overwhelming popular support for then-candidate Ebrahim Raisi, who was elected in the elections that saw the lowest voter turnout four decades (48 percent), but because the Supreme Leader had worked systematically to predetermine their results. At the start, Ali Khamenei oversaw the “sanitization” of the list of candidates to avert surprises and paved the way to a Raisi victory with many candidates’ withdrawal from the race, and eventually, Raisi was made president based on an almost explicit view for the next phase in the Iranian revolutionary regime’s life. This vision encompasses the formation of an Islamist government composed of indoctrinated Supreme Leader loyalists who are closer to the regime’s Islamist factions than its Republican factions. The vision also includes a road map for Iran post-Khamenei. What occurred, then, was an appointment disguised as an election, a personalized regime disguised as a state of institutions, and a closed regime disguised as a democracy. With that, Iran was keen on convincing, through the means available to it, the Iranians- the Arab world and the world at large, that it had held presidential elections. Commentators exaggerated in praising it and emphasizing its superiority to the American electoral process. In Syria, Bashar al-Assad could have continued to impose the status quo he wants, but he insisted on holding presidential elections whose legitimacy is not recognized by most of the world. As those in Iran and those writing about it had done, commentators showered “democratic wedding” with praise in the press and on screens. The day of the election was covered by all the tools available to the regime, as though it had been a genuine competition. Why didn’t the Supreme Leader appoint Raisi- though it is exactly what he did- and why didn’t Bashar al-Assad extend his term by force so long as no one seriously recognized his election legitimacy? We could say that Khamenei and Assad are, to some extent, mocking the concept of democracy by presenting a highly tattered version of it, telling the world and their people before it: this is the democracy that the West is invoking to interfere with our affairs, and you can see how easy it is to rig and falsify to achieve particular ends. Thus, we are facing the desecration of the concept of democracy using the tools of democracy itself. Elsewhere, Western writers and intellectuals can ride the wave of political self-aggrandizement in the West, claiming that tyrants’ invocation of democracy is a victory for democracy and an affirmation that it is the only source of political legitimacy today, even if it is applied through sham elections… This idea is rooted in a more profound concept adopted by Francis Fukuyama, who declared that the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union’s collapse had heralded the end of history, that is, that democracy is the final stage of humanity’s political evolution and the final form that managing public affairs and executive authority would take. The irony is that Khamenei and Assad held elections at a time this is distinguished in two ways: firstly, both their regimes are suffering from a serious internal legitimacy crisis that the elections themselves exposed far more than they papered over. Secondly, the reputation of the concept of democracy itself is suffering from a severe hemorrhage. It starts with its primary fortress in Washington and doesn’t stop at the Post-Soviet Republics in Eastern Europe or Israel, passing through India, the world’s largest democracy. We could talk endlessly about “democracy’s” horrendous consequence for the region, at the developmental level, its implications for economic infrastructure and its prolongment of institutions’ paralysis, as is happening in Lebanon and, to a large extent, in the Palestinian territories since 2007. As for Egypt, the country’s 2020 elections were distinguished by the strong competitiveness of joining the regime’s electoral list and the fact that run-off elections encompassed 87 percent of electoral seats, an indication of their competitiveness… They were elections, in contrast to the electoral process in Iran, in which the enthusiasm of participation clearly indicates the entrenchment of the January 30 Revolution regime’s solidity and its popular legitimacy, which are coupled with a broad, multidimensional development project. On the other hand, democracy wasn’t and won’t be other Middle Eastern states’ course, especially not the Gulf states’ course, for entrenching the legitimacy of their political regimes, which have every right to talk about potent social and political particularities linked to their societies’ composition and the conceptual roots of their systems of governance and the broad consensus on the kinship-based and tribal sources of legitimacy. We are, then, facing several proposals for managing public affairs, achieving development and optimizing systems of governance, which shouldn’t be reduced to democratization and a mechanical push in a single direction. The truth is the West’s reputation, especially that of Washington, is generally poor, particularly its ardent push for liberal democracy. Let’s take an example; the contradictory behavior of former US President Barack Obama’s administration. It rushed, through the president himself, to publicly ask Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down, which gave the Egyptian mass movement an extremely strong push before its real intentions became clear, and it became apparent the Muslim Brotherhood had been extremely effectively “leading from behind.” That brought them to power and almost turned Egypt into a Sunni Iran!! On the other hand, when the Green Revolution erupted in the wake of Khamenei’s direct supervision of the elections rigged in favor of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Washington chose to distance itself, under the pretext of not contaminating the Iranian popular movement and facilitating the subsequent labeling of the movement as pro-American in preparation for its liquidation!! Why wasn’t Obama concerned that the Egyptians who were revolting would be accused of being American stooges but was worried about the same insults being hurled at the Iranians? The simple and straightforward answer is that this was a false pretense in the first place. What Obama really wanted to achieve by distancing himself was safeguarding the secret nuclear program negotiations between his administration that had been ongoing at the time! Obama’s position contributed to the annihilation of the most honorable intifada Iran had seen in 4 decades, and his position in Egypt precipitated a series of events that almost left the Arab world’s largest state toppled by political Islam. Democracy isn’t the gateway for making political and social assessments in the Middle East… it is at least not the only one. Iranian “democracy,” a cheap replica that went as far as predetermining the results, does not cover the Iranian regime’s legitimacy crisis, while the lack of democracy, does not do away with the prestige of the wise governance presented by major Gulf capitals and does not undermine the legitimacy of their systems of governance. This is what the West does not understand, and unless it does, it cannot build fruitful relations that pave the way to good governance and sustainable development in the region. Elections are not a necessary gateway, nor conceptions of bubbles of freedom based on the story of a person here and another there or the orientalist delusion that political Islam is at the heart of countries and societies’ identities in this part of the world.

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 complementary.
The image shows the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The news article discusses the recent presidential elections in Iran and Syria, which were both criticized by the author. The author argues that the elections were rigged and that the results were predetermined. The image is complementary to the news article because it shows the two leaders of Iran and Syria, who are both accused of rigging elections, together. This suggests that they are working together to undermine democracy in the Middle East.


News article:
Why does Iran insist on holding presidential elections while the world watches these elections being rigged on a daily basis during the weeks that precede the day of the vote? The elections’ results were determined weeks before they were held, not because of overwhelming popular support for then-candidate Ebrahim Raisi, who was elected in the elections that saw the lowest voter turnout four decades (48 percent), but because the Supreme Leader had worked systematically to predetermine their results. At the start, Ali Khamenei oversaw the “sanitization” of the list of candidates to avert surprises and paved the way to a Raisi victory with many candidates’ withdrawal from the race, and eventually, Raisi was made president based on an almost explicit view for the next phase in the Iranian revolutionary regime’s life. This vision encompasses the formation of an Islamist government composed of indoctrinated Supreme Leader loyalists who are closer to the regime’s Islamist factions than its Republican factions. The vision also includes a road map for Iran post-Khamenei. What occurred, then, was an appointment disguised as an election, a personalized regime disguised as a state of institutions, and a closed regime disguised as a democracy. With that, Iran was keen on convincing, through the means available to it, the Iranians- the Arab world and the world at large, that it had held presidential elections. Commentators exaggerated in praising it and emphasizing its superiority to the American electoral process. In Syria, Bashar al-Assad could have continued to impose the status quo he wants, but he insisted on holding presidential elections whose legitimacy is not recognized by most of the world. As those in Iran and those writing about it had done, commentators showered “democratic wedding” with praise in the press and on screens. The day of the election was covered by all the tools available to the regime, as though it had been a genuine competition. Why didn’t the Supreme Leader appoint Raisi- though it is exactly what he did- and why didn’t Bashar al-Assad extend his term by force so long as no one seriously recognized his election legitimacy? We could say that Khamenei and Assad are, to some extent, mocking the concept of democracy by presenting a highly tattered version of it, telling the world and their people before it: this is the democracy that the West is invoking to interfere with our affairs, and you can see how easy it is to rig and falsify to achieve particular ends. Thus, we are facing the desecration of the concept of democracy using the tools of democracy itself. Elsewhere, Western writers and intellectuals can ride the wave of political self-aggrandizement in the West, claiming that tyrants’ invocation of democracy is a victory for democracy and an affirmation that it is the only source of political legitimacy today, even if it is applied through sham elections… This idea is rooted in a more profound concept adopted by Francis Fukuyama, who declared that the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union’s collapse had heralded the end of history, that is, that democracy is the final stage of humanity’s political evolution and the final form that managing public affairs and executive authority would take. The irony is that Khamenei and Assad held elections at a time this is distinguished in two ways: firstly, both their regimes are suffering from a serious internal legitimacy crisis that the elections themselves exposed far more than they papered over. Secondly, the reputation of the concept of democracy itself is suffering from a severe hemorrhage. It starts with its primary fortress in Washington and doesn’t stop at the Post-Soviet Republics in Eastern Europe or Israel, passing through India, the world’s largest democracy. We could talk endlessly about “democracy’s” horrendous consequence for the region, at the developmental level, its implications for economic infrastructure and its prolongment of institutions’ paralysis, as is happening in Lebanon and, to a large extent, in the Palestinian territories since 2007. As for Egypt, the country’s 2020 elections were distinguished by the strong competitiveness of joining the regime’s electoral list and the fact that run-off elections encompassed 87 percent of electoral seats, an indication of their competitiveness… They were elections, in contrast to the electoral process in Iran, in which the enthusiasm of participation clearly indicates the entrenchment of the January 30 Revolution regime’s solidity and its popular legitimacy, which are coupled with a broad, multidimensional development project. On the other hand, democracy wasn’t and won’t be other Middle Eastern states’ course, especially not the Gulf states’ course, for entrenching the legitimacy of their political regimes, which have every right to talk about potent social and political particularities linked to their societies’ composition and the conceptual roots of their systems of governance and the broad consensus on the kinship-based and tribal sources of legitimacy.

News article:
The vaccinated can now go maskless. (Mostly.) Some people are looking with horror at this new recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control, while others are reacting with relief. The scientific evidence is pretty clear: There’s powerful data showing that vaccines prevent not just symptomatic Covid-19, but also curb the spread of the virus. Some of the fearful reactions might be driven by people getting stuck on earlier reports that the clinical trials didn’t do enough to test whether the vaccines cut down on transmission. But a lot has changed since then. Pfizer gathered all kinds of real-world data from much larger groups than they studied in the clinical trials, including US healthcare workers and the country of Israel. Those data show that the Pfizer vaccine is preventing transmission. Israel’s infection wave — with thousands of cases a day — has now been reduced to a trickle, even though children and some fraction of adults remain unvaccinated. It’s reasonable to assume that the nearly identical Moderna vaccine will perform as well. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which hasn’t been used as extensively in the US, wasn’t demonstrated to reduce asymptomatic cases the same way, and scientists are still trying to understand the implications of an outbreak among the New York Yankees after most of the players got the single-dose vaccine. So far, there was one mild case and seven without symptoms. The bottom line: the evidence that vaccines protect others is of a stronger and more direct kind than the evidence that masks do. So if you want to protect others, getting vaccinated is more likely to help than wearing a mask — and of course people are still welcome to do both. The burden of proof is higher with vaccines than with masks. With masks, there was an abrupt turnaround last spring when experts began recommending masking without any new, definitive study. Experts I interviewed back then cited the recognition that masks were relatively safe, cheap and harmless, and therefore, if there’s some chance they might help, they should be adopted. There were studies that offered indirect evidence, including ones done in medical facilities with health care workers adopting high quality, tight-fitting N95 masks. And there were simulations showing that cloth masks blocked some of the particles that carry the virus. Last fall the press touted a paper that projected 130,000 lives would be saved by universal masking — but the math was based on the assumption that medical masks and cloth ones would work equally well, preventing about 40% of cases. Another assumption — one that was probably wrong — concerned the half of Americans surveyed at the time who said they didn’t wear a mask every time they left the house. The assumption was that these people were failing to wear them in situations where transmission was possible. But it’s a lot more likely that many such people were just walking their dogs, jogging or hiking, and still masking in stores or taxis or at the doctor’s office. Scientists have been saying for months that masking alone outdoors is not likely to save anyone — something mainstream media outlets like New York Times took much longer to admit to. Vaccines have faced a much more stringent level of scrutiny. As FDA requires for any new drug or vaccine, the burden of proof is on the vaccine makers to demonstrate they work and won’t cause harm. The clinical data that Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have gathered are high quality studies that show vaccines protect against symptomatic disease. There was also limited data from the Moderna and Pfizer clinical trials showing a drop in transmission, and, later, better real-world data showing the same thing in a study of US health care workers. Even stronger data out of Israel has shown that the Pfizer vaccines cut down on both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases by more than 89%. This may not sound like a good enough number to take off your mask, but experts say that these few breakthrough cases are also much less likely to transmit to others since the vaccines cuts down on the virus particles that people harbor in their noses. Importantly, this also doesn’t mean that you have an 11% chance of getting Covid if you’re vaccinated; that’s not how the math works. That’s one reason that in the US, where the 95% effective Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are widely used, the real-world “breakthrough” infection rate has been a fraction of a percent. Sure, the new recommendations are hard to enforce since unvaccinated people might “cheat” — but worries about this are based on an overestimate of the risks unmasked people pose to others, and an underestimate of the benefits of the vaccine. The big risk unmasked, unvaccinated people are posing is to themselves. The cautious are welcome to keep wearing masks to add an additional safety net, but given the choice, getting vaccinated offers much better protection — for others as well as yourself. Bloomberg

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced they are investigating reports of heart issues in young patients who have received a Covid-19 vaccine. There have been “relatively few” cases of young people developing heart symptoms following their inoculations, but the CDC is requesting that “information about this potential adverse event” be provided to clinicians to “enhance early recognition and appropriate management of persons who develop myocarditis symptoms.” Myocarditis is an inflammation in the heart muscle. The few dozen cases so far have involved teenagers and young adults, mostly males, who have received either the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. Also on rt.com Fauci faces drop in confidence from 40% of Americans over past year – poll The CDC’s vaccine safety group has not determined whether the condition is directly related to the vaccinations, and said the cases have been “mild” thus far. Patients have reported their symptoms within four days of receiving a vaccine dose. Follow-up cases are currently ongoing. The agency has not specified the exact ages of the patients reporting symptoms, but the Pfizer-BioNTech has been approved for people 16 years or older since December, and to people between the ages of 12 and 15 since last month. In April, Israel’s Health Ministry also announced it was looking into a handful of cases of heart inflammation, possibly linked to the Pfizer vaccine. The cases reported had been from people aged 30 or below. “Adverse events are regularly and thoroughly reviewed and we have not observed a higher rate of myocarditis than what would be expected in the general population. A causal link to the vaccine has not been established,” Pfizer said at the time in a statement. If you like this story, share it with a friend!

The Health Ministry announced Wednesday that starting next week, it will begin vaccinating children aged 12-16 against coronavirus.

The ministry said that in light of the country's low infection rates, children in that age group who are at risk from the virus will be the first advised to get the shots, along with those living with family members who are likewise at risk of serious illness. Families who are planning to travel abroad will also be included in the first round of vaccinations, alongside anyone else who wants to vaccinate their children. The ministry said that vaccination would not be compulsory for the age group and parents will be able to decide if they want their children to get the shots. 4 View gallery A coronavirus testing facility at Ben-Gurion Airport ( Photo: Reuters ) Earlier Wednesday it was announced that Home Front Command has ceased operating coronavirus testing centers due to the low infection rate in the country. The ministry said that from now on, COVID tests would only be performed at HMO clinics and only for symptomatic patients or those who had come into contact with verified carriers. On Tuesday, a Health Ministry study found a small number of heart inflammation cases in males under the age of 30 after the second Pfizer vaccine shot. 4 View gallery A healthcare worker holding a vial of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine ( Photo: AFP ) In Israel, 275 cases of myocarditis were reported between December 2020 and May 2021 among more than 5 million vaccinated people, the ministry said in disclosing the findings of a study it commissioned to examine the matter. Most patients who experienced heart inflammation spent no more than four days in hospital and 95% of the cases were classified as mild, according to the study, which the ministry said was conducted by three teams of experts. The study found "there is a probable link between receiving the second dose (of Pfizer) vaccine and the appearance of myocarditis among men aged 16 to 30," it said in a statement.

News article:
The White House unveiled its plans for sharing unused COVID-19 vaccines with the world, freeing up 25 million shots in the first tranche for countries badly hit by the pandemic such as India and for neighbors Canada and Mexico. The U.S. has said it will share 80 million doses by the end of June and on Thursday officials said they would retain control of where they go. The new plan allocates three quarters of unused vaccines for the U.N.-backed COVAX global distribution system, sending some some 6 million to Latin America and the Caribbean, about 7 million to Asia and roughly 5 million to Africa. President Joe Biden said the U.S. was not sharing vaccinations to 'secure favors or extract concessions' as his administration announced where the first 25 million unused doses would be sent.

'We are sharing these vaccines to save lives and to lead the world in bringing an end to the pandemic, with the power of our example and with our values.' Critics said it was too little, too late and called on the administration to invest in manufacturing sites around the world. Developed nations have been accused of monopolizing vaccine production, protecting their own populations at the expense of poorer countries. The U.S. ranks second only to China for vaccine production but was singled out for keeping almost its entire supply at home.

Another six million will go to what the White House described as 'regional priorities' and 'partner recipients' including Mexico, Canada, and the Republic of Korea, West Bank and Gaza, Ukraine, Kosovo, Haiti, Georgia, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Yemen, as well as for United Nations frontline workers. The Biden administration has said 25% of spare doses will be kept in reserve for emergencies. 'As long as this pandemic is raging anywhere in the world, the American people will still be vulnerable,' said Biden said. 'And the United States is committed to bringing the same urgency to international vaccination efforts that we have demonstrated at home.' In a briefing, said National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S would retain control of where the vaccines went. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S. would stay in control of where the doses distributed through COVAX ultimately go 'We're not seeking to extract concessions, we're not extorting, we're not imposing conditions the way that other countries who are providing doses are doing; we're doing none of those things,' he said. He added that Gaza had been picked out because of the recent crisis there. 'We're not asking anything of the people of Gaza and West Bank, but we feel that given what they are dealing with, in the situation on the ground there, it is only right and proper and good for the United States to actually allocate some doses to that country,' he said. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said via Twitter that he had offered his thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris in a phone call when he was informed that doses were on their way. 'I expressed our appreciation on behalf of the people of Mexico,' he said on Twitter. Campaigners demanding more help for poor nations said the announcement was a good step but should be followed with a deeper commitment. 'The donation of these few doses is welcome but deeply insufficient, and no substitute for a plan of scale and urgency to end the pandemic,' Peter Maybarduk, director of Public Citizen’s Access to Medicines program. 'The U.S. needs to do more, much more.' Tom Hart, of the One Campaign, also welcomed the news but said the U.S. should accelerate plans to distribute AstraZeneca doses that have not yet been licensed by Washington. 'However, it’s disappointing to see delays in donating the 60 million AstraZeneca doses – which have been approved for emergency use by the World Health Organization and will go unused otherwise,' he said. Biden announced in April that the U.S. would send the AstraZeneca vaccines overseas by July 4. However, problems at a manufacturing plant have delayed production.

News article:
The White House unveiled its plans for sharing unused COVID-19 vaccines with the world, freeing up 25 million shots in the first tranche for countries badly hit by the pandemic such as India and for neighbors Canada and Mexico. The U.S. has said it will share 80 million doses by the end of June and on Thursday officials said they would retain control of where they go. The new plan allocates three quarters of unused vaccines for the U.N.-backed COVAX global distribution system, sending some some 6 million to Latin America and the Caribbean, about 7 million to Asia and roughly 5 million to Africa.

News article:
Some 600,000 Israelis aged 12-15 are eligible to receive a vaccine against the coronavirus from Sunday. Thousands have already booked appointments through the country’s health maintenance organizations (HMOs), according to Saturday reports. The move comes six months after Israel began its vaccination drive for adults, and after the US Food and Drug Administration okayed the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the age group. Some HMOs have already vaccinated children under 16 in at-risk groups and have seen no significant side effects from the shot. According to the plan, children in that age group who are at greater risk of suffering severe symptoms from coronavirus infection will be the first advised to get the shots, along with those living with family members who are likewise at risk of serious illness. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Families that are expecting to travel abroad will also be included in the first round of vaccinations, the ministry said. The ministry stressed to The Times of Israel that vaccination will not be compulsory for adolescents, only advised, and parents will be able to decide if they want their children to get the shots. On Tuesday it was reported that a member of the Health Ministry panel that has been advising on COVID-19 vaccinations received death threats during the process of approval for the inoculation of children. Advertisement Prof. Galia Rahav of Sheba Medical Center received threatening messages from anti-vaxxers online, including images of tombstones with her name and a “pulsa dinura,” a Jewish death curse that literally translates as “lashes of fire,” Kan news reported. The hospital said it was coordinating with police over the threats and will provide Rahav with security at all times. Israel’s mass vaccination drive, which has already given both shots to over half the population, along with lockdown measures, brought down the number of new daily cases (based on a weekly average), from 8,600 at the peak of the health crisis to just 19 on Sunday. On Tuesday, the last of a series of restrictions in place for over a year lapsed as case numbers continued to fall. The only major restrictions remaining are the mandate requiring masks to be worn indoors, expected to be lifted soon as well, and quarantine requirements for those entering the country. At the height of the pandemic, there were 88,000 active cases in the country and 1,228 serious cases; as of Friday, there were 199 active infections and 39 people in serious condition. Since the beginning of the outbreak early last year, 839,539 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in Israel and there have been 6,417 deaths from the disease.

News article:
By Yisrael Price YERUSHALAYIM — The Israeli health ministry said on Sunday that not a single new native case of covid was detected over the past twenty four hours, the first time that could be said since the outbreak over a year ago. The ministry noted that four cases were recorded over Shabbos, but all of those originated abroad. Health minister Yuli Edelstein said on Sunday, that providing the situation remains stable, all mask-wearing regulations can be cancelled in nine days, on June 15. As of now, masks are still required in indoor public places. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Edelstein attended an appreciation ceremony at the Jerusalem Theater for health system personnel and partner agencies for their contribution to the fight against the coronavirus. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla addressed the gathering by videoconference. Netanyahu said that “Israel’s victory was achieved thanks to two basic elements: The millions of vaccines that we brought to the country and their rapid distribution to the citizens of Israel. This morning we also began vaccinating young people aged 12-16. This is huge news; it promises us herd immunity.” Kurz said: “I would like to thank you, Bibi, for our good cooperation in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. It was you who first alerted me about the massive danger of the coronavirus at the beginning of last year. Following your warnings, we took hard measures very early in Austria last year, which helped us to get through the first wave quite effectively… “With a view to the future waves, I would like to enhance the cooperation on research and development and vaccine production with Israel and Denmark.” Pfizer’s Bourla similarly commended the Israeli effort and Netanyahu in particular. “As many life science companies in the world, Pfizer has collaborated with many governments around the world to fight this pandemic, but nowhere has this collaboration been more effective than in Israel. “Israel has done the most amazing job in mobilizing their healthcare system and delivering the most successful vaccination campaign in the world. “During my discussions with the Israeli government, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convinced me that Israel would be the ideal place to demonstrate to the world what a fast vaccination campaign can achieve. “But what Israel was able to eventually achieve exceeded all my expectations. To date, 57% of the Israeli population has been fully vaccinated. And recently published real-world data from Israel suggests that in its first 120 days, the country’s vaccination program with our vaccine prevented approximately 159,000 infections, 25,000 hospitalizations and 5,500 deaths,” Bourla said.

To date, 57% of the Israeli population has been fully vaccinated. And recently published real-world data from Israel suggests that in its first 120 days, the country’s vaccination program with our vaccine prevented approximately 159,000 infections, 25,000 hospitalizations and 5,500 deaths,” Bourla said.

News article:
By Yisrael Price YERUSHALAYIM — The Israeli health ministry said on Sunday that not a single new native case of covid was detected over the past twenty four hours, the first time that could be said since the outbreak over a year ago. The ministry noted that four cases were recorded over Shabbos, but all of those originated abroad. Health minister Yuli Edelstein said on Sunday, that providing the situation remains stable, all mask-wearing regulations can be cancelled in nine days, on June 15. As of now, masks are still required in indoor public places. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Edelstein attended an appreciation ceremony at the Jerusalem Theater for health system personnel and partner agencies for their contribution to the fight against the coronavirus. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla addressed the gathering by videoconference. Netanyahu said that “Israel’s victory was achieved thanks to two basic elements: The millions of vaccines that we brought to the country and their rapid distribution to the citizens of Israel. This morning we also began vaccinating young people aged 12-16. This is huge news; it promises us herd immunity.” Kurz said: “I would like to thank you, Bibi, for our good cooperation in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. It was you who first alerted me about the massive danger of the coronavirus at the beginning of last year.

News article:
ANKARA: Turkish citizens aged between 40 and 50 will begin getting COVID-19 jabs as part of the country’s vaccination campaign, launched in mid-January. The move comes as the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention eased travel recommendations for more than 110 countries and territories, including Turkey. Those aged 45 to 50 will begin receiving their first dose on June 10, whereas citizens in the 40 to 45 group will get their jabs by June 14. The authorities also began vaccinating musicians, film and TV series staff as well as university employees without an age limit in a bid to re-energize the country’s cultural activities and prepare for face-to-face education in September. Tens of thousands of music industry workers have lost their jobs since March 2020, and concerts are still banned under social distancing measures. From next week, the country will also inoculate volunteers for the phase 3 human trials of a locally developed COVID-19 vaccine candidate. According to a survey conducted by Infakto Research Workshop and Habitat Association, one-third of Turkish youth are against vaccination. Turkish authorities are considering special restrictions for those refusing to get vaccinated. “Vaccine skepticism is relatively low in Turkey and is getting lesser with the public awareness campaigns. It recently appeared that Russia-sponsored misinformation campaigns on social media have been fuelling this trend all around the world,” Prof. Guner Sonmez, a radiologist from Uskudar University in Istanbul, told Arab News. Several social media influencers recently confessed that they received payment from a Russian-linked company to discredit the Pfizer vaccine in favor of its own Sputnik V jab. Several anti-vaccine hashtags have become trending topics on Turkish Twitter in recent weeks. The number of single-day COVID-19 deaths recently fell below 100. On June 9, the country confirmed 6,454 new coronavirus cases and 87 deaths from COVID-19. So far, Turkey has administered over 31.75 million vaccines, with about 18.5 million people getting their first jab and 13.5 million receiving both doses. Germany on Friday removed Turkey from the list of high-risk countries. But the country remains listed in the orange category on the EU’s risk scale. Travelers from Turkey will be allowed to enter European countries if they can prove their COVID-19 immunity either through vaccination documents or recovery from the disease starting by July 1. As there is a shortage of Chinese Sinovac vaccines, citizens are mainly getting the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Ugur Sahin, the co-founder and CEO of Germany-based BioNTech, is expected to visit Turkey, his home country, at the end of June. If the country receives 30 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech jabs at the end of the month, people as young as 20 can be vaccinated as well. Meanwhile, a Turkish citizen recently attracted fame after his thank-you letter to Sinovac and the accompanying 50 Turkish liras ($6) he sent to the company to show his gratitude for the vaccine was revealed by the international media. The accelerated vaccination program will also help the country to prevent another lost tourism season, with the Turkish economy relying heavily on tourists to bring in foreign currency revenue that helps to recover its current account deficit. Last month, two big events that were key to attracting tourists’ cash were lost due to the high rate of daily infections. Formula One canceled the Turkish Grand Prix scheduled for June and the UEFA Champions League final was relocated from Turkey to Portugal. Russia and Turkey continue diplomatic meetings to consider resuming full-scale air traffic between the two countries. A lost season would cost Turkey 500,000 Russian tourists in the summer. Tourism workers have also been prioritized to receive vaccinations, while thousands of accommodation sites, restaurants, cafes, boats and tour vehicles have been granted “Safe Tourism Certificates” to instill trust in the incoming tourists. However, Moscow recently extended its flight ban to Turkey until June 21, which is expected to cost the tourism industry $500 million in June alone, according to Turkish tourism operators. “Israel reached herd immunity threshold when 62 percent of its citizens were fully vaccinated. If we receive the promised batch of vaccines by the end of this month, it can also help the tourism season to recover and life will return to normal by September,” Sonmez said. He added: “A higher percentage of vaccinations will also help us against mutated virus strains. The authorities recently allowed Family Health Centres that are set up in each district to administer the vaccines. That will help people who have concerns or accessibility problems to go to the hospitals.”

The Health Ministry filed a complaint with police against the man after the infections were detected among the 6th graders, Channel 12 news reports. The network quotes an investigation by the Health Ministry district branch as saying the suspect “did not fulfill the quarantine requirement in full upon his return from overseas and did not perform a [coronavirus] test on the ninth day, allowing him to shorten the quarantine from 14 days.” After the outbreak was detected, the rest of the students were sent to quarantine and the IDF’s Home Front Command was testing children in all grades for other potential infections.

Israel is set to unify all of its coronavirus vaccine certificates under one "unified pass" as the first jabs given to Israelis reache the six-month mark. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The country began its exceptionally high-paced vaccination campaign back in December that allowed Israel to become one of the first states in the world to fully reopen following the COVID-19 pandemic. 2 View gallery Teens getting vaccinated in Tel Aviv ( Photo: AFP ) The Health Ministry said the so-called unified pass will be available to Israelis in two weeks' time on June 30 and will be valid until the end of 2021. The certificate will consolidate the Green Pass issued to those who'd been given both vaccine shots and those who have recovered from the virus. "The ministry is working to create a unified pass that will replace the vaccine and recovery certificates. The launch of the unified certificate is expected in the near future, and currently it is expected to be valid until the end of 2021," said the Health Ministry in a statement. The ministry added that some of the passes for recovered COVID sufferers will expire soon, depending on when the person first contracted the virus. 2 View gallery People arrive at Ben Gurion Airport ( Photo: Amit Shaal ) Some of those who were infected with the disease early on will have their passes expire as soon as the end of June.

Former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu deserves overall credit for Israel's triumph over the coronavirus pandemic. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter After leading Israel's trailblazing vaccination campaign, which flattened the infection curve and essentially wiped out the pathogen within the country, he finishes his tenure on the same week health authorities scrap the last major restriction on Israeli citizens — the indoor mask mandate. 5 View gallery Then-prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu receives a coronavirus vaccine at Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan, December 19, 2020 ( Photo: Reuters ) However, up until that victorious moment, Netanyahu had managed the crisis through personal political interests while repeatedly ignoring health officials' advice. A prime example of this would be his much-belated call to bar flights to and from the United States. While incoming flights from China were banned since January 30, hundreds of flights from the U.S. kept arriving unabated and while cases kept skyrocketing in the U.S., countless travelers entered Israel freely without quarantine. This all stemmed from Netanyahu's fear such a ban would harm U.S.-Israeli ties. It took him until March 9 to enjoin all arrivals to self-isolate. Israel paid a heavy toll for those several weeks of inaction. 5 View gallery Passengers wearing masks push trolleys at the departures terminal at Ben Gurion Airport ( Photo: Reuters ) A Health Ministry report from mid-April stated that 40% of Israelis who returned from abroad carrying the virus came from the United States. The report showed that 569 confirmed patients in Israel at the time had contracted the virus in the U.S., four times more than any other nation. This spike in cases mainly affected the ultra-Orthodox community whose COVID-19 infection and death rates significantly exceeded that of any other group.

In March, Netanyahu said that Israel could see tens of thousands of daily cases within a week, but as the first wave of infections ebbed away by the end of May, he failed to predict the next spike in infections and called on Israelis to go out and "have a good time." Another example of Netanyahu's shortcomings in handling the pandemic was him outright ignoring ultra-Orthodox educational institutions that remained open while non-Haredi students across the country were forced to go into distant learning. This unequal treatment stemmed first and foremost from pressure applied on him by his ultra-Orthodox government allies who demanded their communities' schools remain open despite soaring cases. 5 View gallery Netanyahu and then-health minister Yaakov Litzman ( Photo: EPA ) The fact Netanyahu did not do more to combat this phenomenon led to frequent tackles with health officials, chief among them was the country's first pandemic czar, Prof. Ronni Gamzu.

The Palestinian Authority did not immediately comment on the deal Israel is to provide around one million doses of Covid-19 vaccine to the Palestinian Authority in a swap as their expiry date looms, the Israeli prime minister's office said Israel is to provide around one million doses of Covid-19 vaccine to the Palestinian Authority in a swap as their expiry date looms, the Israeli prime minister's office said Friday. "Israel has signed an agreement with the Palestinian Authority, and will supply approximately one million doses of Pfizer vaccine that is about to expire," Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's office said, in a joint statement with the defence and health ministries. Israel "will receive in return the doses that Pfizer is to send to the Palestinian Authority," the statement added. The Palestinian Authority, based in the occupied West Bank, did not immediately comment on the deal. "Israel will receive the same amount of doses of Pfizer in September/October 2021, on behalf of what is destined for the Palestinian Authority," the Israeli statement added. "This agreement was made possible after noting that the stock of vaccines that Israel has in its possession meets its current needs." Israel launched a sweeping vaccination campaign after obtaining millions of doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. More than 55 percent of Israel's population -- some 5.1 million people -- have received both doses of the vaccine. On the Palestinian side, just over 260,000 people have received their two doses in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian health ministry. From Wednesday to Thursday, 170 new Covid-19 cases were recorded in the West Bank and Gaza, bringing the total since the start of the pandemic to more than 312,000, 3,540 of them. In Israel, 25 new cases were recorded from Thursday to Friday, bringing the total number of cases to 840,000, with more than 6,420 deaths. The deal comes amid high tensions between Israel and the Palestinians, with violations of a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers that went into effect on May 21, ending 11 days of Israeli assault. Late Thursday, Israeli fighter jets carried out air strikes on Gaza for a second time since the ceasefire. The military said they were in retaliation for three days of incendiary ballons launched from the Palestinian enclave. In Gaza, the coronavirus response has been hobbled by last month's fighting, which devastated infrastructure and reduced entire tower blocks to piles of smoking rubble. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
By Hamodia Staff YERUSHALAYIM — Palestinian groups on Sunday demanded the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into Israel’s transfer of Pfizer covid vaccines to the Palestinian Authority. This comes in the wake of a blowup over the fact that the doses in the million vaccine shipment were soon to expire. After initially accepting the delivery, they decided to refuse it. Israeli officials insisted that the PA knew of the expiration date beforehand, and that the vaccines were perfectly safe to use. The Palestinian Coalition for Accountability and Integrity (AMAN) faulted the PA for its handling of the matter: “It is the responsibility of the Palestinian government, represented by the Ministry of Health, to announce the details of the deal before concluding it, in order to enhance the principle of transparency.” “Accordingly, AMAN demands the formation of an independent investigation committee, with the participation of representatives of civil society organizations, to investigate the merits of this deal.” The Palestinian Health Professions Syndicate and the Palestinian National Democratic Forum also demanded an investigation. Meanwhile, three countries have contacted Israel to inquire about the possibility of obtaining the vaccines, if Ramallah doesn’t want them, according to Haaretz. Citing an unnamed diplomatic source, the paper says Israel is in touch with the countries about doses set to expire in July. The Palestinian Authority rejected the transfer of more than a million COVID-19 vaccine doses from Israel after its health authorities determined that they “fall short of meeting the technical criteria,” PA Health Minister Mai al-Kaila said in a press conference late Friday, following Palestinian public criticism. The announcement came after Israel delivered a first shipment of 100,000 Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses to the PA, within hours of the Israeli government’s announcement of the vaccine exchange agreement. Israel said it would supply up to 1.4 million doses of the vaccine immediately to the PA, and in September or October, when the doses purchased from Pfizer by the PA are due to arrive, the same number of doses would be returned to Israel. The exchange deal would allow a large number of Palestinians to be vaccinated months earlier than planned. However, after some of the vaccines had already been transferred to Palestinian possession, Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh announced late Friday that he was canceling the shipment because they are expiring soon. Israel, however, said it had given the Palestinians that information. The PA’s reversal was taken after many Palestinians criticized the PA government over the deal with Israel, largely because the doses were about to expire. They called on the government to cancel the agreement. The Israeli Health Ministry said on Motzoei Shabbos that “the COVID-19 vaccines we gave the Palestinian Authority were perfectly valid. The expiration dates were known to the PA and everything was agreed upon in advance. The Palestinians received the same vaccines that are currently given to Israelis.” The PA government purchased four million vaccines from Pfizer and is hoping to receive them as soon as possible, she said, noting that it would continue to exert pressure on the company to provide the Palestinians with the vaccines they had purchased as soon as possible. Already on Thursday, before any formal announcement was made, the PA reportedly held issue with two conditions surrounding the transfer of the vaccines, one of which was that the agreement would not be signed under the “State of Palestine” and the second was that the vaccines would not be transferred to the Gaza Strip. “Yesterday, we informed the Israelis that we were giving up all vaccines because they had agreed not to supply some of them to Gaza,” the Palestinian health minister said Friday. “Today, they came back to us and agreed.”

The Palestinian Coalition for Accountability and Integrity (AMAN) faulted the PA for its handling of the matter: “It is the responsibility of the Palestinian government, represented by the Ministry of Health, to announce the details of the deal before concluding it, in order to enhance the principle of transparency.” “Accordingly, AMAN demands the formation of an independent investigation committee, with the participation of representatives of civil society organizations, to investigate the merits of this deal.” The Palestinian Health Professions Syndicate and the Palestinian National Democratic Forum also demanded an investigation. Meanwhile, three countries have contacted Israel to inquire about the possibility of obtaining the vaccines, if Ramallah doesn’t want them, according to Haaretz. Citing an unnamed diplomatic source, the paper says Israel is in touch with the countries about doses set to expire in July. The Palestinian Authority rejected the transfer of more than a million COVID-19 vaccine doses from Israel after its health authorities determined that they “fall short of meeting the technical criteria,” PA Health Minister Mai al-Kaila said in a press conference late Friday, following Palestinian public criticism. The announcement came after Israel delivered a first shipment of 100,000 Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses to the PA, within hours of the Israeli government’s announcement of the vaccine exchange agreement. Israel said it would supply up to 1.4 million doses of the vaccine immediately to the PA, and in September or October, when the doses purchased from Pfizer by the PA are due to arrive, the same number of doses would be returned to Israel. The exchange deal would allow a large number of Palestinians to be vaccinated months earlier than planned. However, after some of the vaccines had already been transferred to Palestinian possession, Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh announced late Friday that he was canceling the shipment because they are expiring soon. Israel, however, said it had given the Palestinians that information. The PA’s reversal was taken after many Palestinians criticized the PA government over the deal with Israel, largely because the doses were about to expire. They called on the government to cancel the agreement. The Israeli Health Ministry said on Motzoei Shabbos that “the COVID-19 vaccines we gave the Palestinian Authority were perfectly valid. The expiration dates were known to the PA and everything was agreed upon in advance. The Palestinians received the same vaccines that are currently given to Israelis.” The PA government purchased four million vaccines from Pfizer and is hoping to receive them as soon as possible, she said, noting that it would continue to exert pressure on the company to provide the Palestinians with the vaccines they had purchased as soon as possible. Already on Thursday, before any formal announcement was made, the PA reportedly held issue with two conditions surrounding the transfer of the vaccines, one of which was that the agreement would not be signed under the “State of Palestine” and the second was that the vaccines would not be transferred to the Gaza Strip. “Yesterday, we informed the Israelis that we were giving up all vaccines because they had agreed not to supply some of them to Gaza,” the Palestinian health minister said Friday. “Today, they came back to us and agreed.”

News article:
By Aryeh Stern YERUSHALAYIM — Israel is set to drop a number of restrictions on air travel starting next month, including a ban on the entry of most individual tourists. The Interior Ministry announced on Sunday that beginning on next Thursday, July 1, all vaccinated tourists, whether they are arriving as individuals or as part of group tours, will be granted automatic entry into Israel, without the need for prior approval. From now until July 1, the Ministry said, tourists will still need to apply for approval prior to entering Israel, adding that approval will be granted based on a number of criteria. Chief among the deciding factors, the Ministry said, will be the tourist’s COVID-19 vaccination status. Unvaccinated tourists who are permitted to enter the country prior to July 1 will be required to remain in isolation 10 to 14 days, based on Health Ministry guidelines. Children under six who have not been vaccinated will be granted entry if their parents are approved based on the criteria. During the interim period, tourists will not be permitted into the country from nations with high COVID-19 infection rates, including India, Russia, Mexico, Braizl, South Africa, and Argentina. Exceptions to this ban will be made by a special committee. Israelis will be permitted to travel abroad freely, with the exception of countries on the black list with high infection rates. The exceptions committee will also evaluate requests for travel to the countries on the list. Foreign nationals will be permitted to leave Israel with no restrictions. Entry to foreign nationals will be open without prior approval for residents of most countries, though the Ministry said Sunday it is still drawing up a list of countries whose citizens will be required to seek permission to enter Israel. Automatic entry to Israel will be dependent on travelers having been vaccinated, and the Ministry said it will release details in the coming days regarding which COVID vaccines it will accept for the purposes of entering the country.

A senior health expert said on Monday that the coronavirus in Israel is under better control than in other countries despite the increased spread of the Delta variant that was observed in recent days. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Professor Ran Balicer, who heads a panel of medical professionals advising the Health Ministry said that the fact that most Israelis were already vaccinated against COVID-19 protected the country from a rise in morbidity. "There is no cause for panic," he said. 3 View gallery School children in Modi'in face masks after a coronavirus outbreak was detected there last week ( Photo: Yariv Katz ) Balicer said in an interview on Ynet, that the situation at the Ben Gurion International Airport, where a growing number of passengers were arriving from countries with high rates of contagion and over-crowding was hampering coronavirus testing efforts, was unfortunate. "We must understand that this is a complicated time because of the Delta variant of the virus," he said. The U.K. is the country most appropriate to compare Israel to because of their successful vaccine drive, but they have only vaccinated 60% of the adult population thus far compared to 85% in Israel," he said. "We may also see community spread here as was demonstrated in Britain, but our vaccinated population might prove to provide a better protection and any outbreaks detected, and we should be able to contain such outbreaks," Balicer said. "We may not be able to know how successful we can be, in advance," he said adding that great efforts were needed in the coming weeks, to prevent more cases from entering the country. Ynet has leaned that at close to 5,000 people arrived at Ben Gurion Airport from Russia in the past month and at least 31 of them had COVID-19, representing 0.63%, of passengers, the highest rate of cases recorded in Israel. 3 View gallery Israelis line up to be tested at the Ben Gurion International Airport in April But the Delta variant was already in the country, Balicer said and the airport was not the only source of its spread. "Vaccinated adults were for the most part protected by vaccines, but some could still be infected with 5%-10% of those exposed to the so-called UK variant susceptible and 10%-20% of those exposed to the Delta variant could be infected. 95% of those who received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine were protected enough to prevent serious illness or hospitalization," he said. Balicer said the Health Ministry was still evaluating data before making its final recommendation to vaccinate young teens age 12 to 15. "This is a complex matter," he said. "We are reviewing all the data accumulated by the ministry. We found that girls were less likely to suffer from unwanted side effects than boys," Balicer said. 3 View gallery A 14-year old girl receives her coronavirus vaccine in Tel Aviv earlier this month ( Photo: AFP ) "I would certainly recommend vaccinating the children in areas where an outbreak was detected. But since there is a higher risk for boys from a passing inflammation of the hear muscle, a side effect of the vaccine, I think the decision should be made in consultation between parents and their doctors until there is a final ministerial recommendation," he said. "I would certainly recommend all kids to receive their vaccines before overseas travel," Balizer said. The senior health official said the renewal of a mask mandate for indoor settings should not be imposed but a recommendation to use masks was warranted. "Ultimately it a matter of personal responsibility to protect our health," he said but added that that too would be part of the conversation inside the Health Ministry.

News article:
The Palestinian Authority (PA) plans to renew a deal to receive 1.4 million Pfizer vaccines from Israel, after rejecting the original supply due to the vaccines being too close to their expiration date. According to Wafa news agency, PA Health Minister Mai Alkaila confirmed yesterday that her office would renegotiate with Pfizer and the Israeli Ministry of Health on how to complete the implementation of the agreement in a way that would ensure the safety of the doses. "We will resume discussions with Pfizer to obtain the vaccines that expire at the end of the month of July as soon as possible, so that we have sufficient time to vaccinate all groups established according to the national vaccination plan," through which the PA hopes to achieve a 70 per cent rate of immunity, Alkaila said. The initial delivery of Pfizer-BioNtech doses failed to conform "to the specifications contained in the agreement, and accordingly, Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh instructed the minister of health to cancel the agreement," PA spokesman, Ibrahim Melhem, said. "The government refuses to receive vaccines that are about to expire," he added. READ: A new mental health crisis is raging in Gaza Among the issues was Israel's objection to signing the agreement with the "State of Palestine", as well as an attempt to prevent the vaccines from going to the Gaza Strip, which was categorically rejected by the Ministry of Health, explained Alkaila. She stated that the ministry's responsibility includes all Palestinians. "We confirmed that we will send the doses anywhere, and no one imposes his will on this issue," she said. Israel, which has fully reopened after vaccinating some 85 per cent of its adult population, has faced criticism for medical apartheid and not sharing its vaccines with the 4.5 million Palestinians living under its occupation in the West Bank and Gaza. Rights groups have said that Israel, as an occupying power, is obliged to provide vaccines to the Palestinians. Israel denies having such an obligation, pointing to interim peace agreements reached with the Palestinians in the 1990s.

Amid a surge of new virus cases in Israel, there were 125 patients diagnosed on Monday, a figure more than twice the number detected the day before and the highest daily caseload since April 20. There were just 49 cases detected on Sunday. Health officials, blaming arrivals from abroad who did not adhere to quarantine rules as the prime cause of the outbreak, said Tuesday that increased fines will likely be introduced to punish violators. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, Transportation Minister Merav Michaeli, Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, and Public Security Minister Omer Barlev were to visit Ben Gurion Airport later in the day to review procedures for processing arrivals. “We will not hesitate to do what needs to be done,” said Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz earlier as he toured the Abarbanel Mental Health Center in Bat Yam.

This loophole will be closed,” Horowitz said of Ben Gurion, where on Friday many incoming travelers were allowed to leave the airport without having been tested, due to long lines. In addition, national coronavirus czar Nachman Ash told the Kan public broadcaster that fines of around NIS 5,000 are expected to be introduced for those who travel to six prohibited countries where there are significant virus outbreaks.

Health Ministry director-general Chezy Levy said that officials are also planning to issue an order that masks be worn in schools in areas that have seen increased infection rate and where there is a virus spread in the local education system. The order will also apply to health centers. “The order will include wearing masks in all places where there is contact between a therapist and a patient, and certainly in places where there is a high risk,” he said “In crowded places, including crowded public transportation, it would be wise to wear a mask,” Levy said. “But this is not an order, this is an ongoing recommendation.” He also stressed that there are currently no plans to reapply recently lifted restrictions that had been used to bring down infection rates. Advertisement Testing has indicated that the Delta variant, which was first detected in India, is driving the outbreak, Levy said. Health Ministry figures released Tuesday showed that there are now 434 active virus patients in Israel. Of those diagnosed, at least 78 were children, according to Hebrew media reports, with virus cases detected in schools in Ramat Hashaon, Kfar Saba, Kochav Yair and Herzliya, among other places. The IDF said that two female soldiers and a civilian contractor have been diagnosed with COVID-19, despite all three of them having been vaccinated. The infected people were put into isolation in accordance with Health Ministry guidelines and testing will be done of other service personnel in relevant units, the army said. There are 89 active patients in the town of Binyamina, identified as a focal point of the recent resurgence of the virus, the highest number for any town in the country. The city of Modiin was next with 49 patients, followed by Jerusalem with 34. A panel of experts tasked with advising on the virus outbreak will convene on Wednesday to discuss the latest developments. Officials have expressed concern at the potential for the Delta variant to cause a relapse of the pandemic. Children are considered particularly vulnerable, as most are not vaccinated. Israel has begun offering vaccines to 12- to 15-year-olds, who previously were not included in the national vaccination plan, and in recent days health officials have increasingly advised that parents have their children inoculated. Bennett announced late Sunday that Israel would step up COVID-19 testing and restrictions at Ben Gurion Airport, as well as enforcement of quarantine for those arrivals required to self-isolate. Since the start of the outbreak last year 840,032 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in Israel, and there have been 6,428 deaths due to the virus.

News article:
Travelers leaving Israel are required starting Tuesday to declare they aren’t heading to high-risk countries with widespread COVID-19 that have been blacklisted by the Health Ministry. The directive, announced by the ministry on Monday, will apply to Israeli citizens and residents 16 and older. The form, which must be signed 24 hours prior to leaving the country, can be accessed here. The measure comes as the government has ramped up restrictions on entry to the country in light of the renewed outbreak of the Delta variant in the country, primarily due to arrivals from abroad. The countries where Israelis are currently banned from traveling, per a Health Ministry order, are Argentina, Brazil, India, South Africa, Mexico and Russia. On Sunday, ministers in the cabinet decided that anyone who travels to those six countries will be fined NIS 5,000 ($1,500). The Health Ministry on Sunday added Belarus and Kyrgyzstan to the list of nations with a “critical travel warning,” joining Uganda, Uruguay, the United Arab Emirates, Seychelles, Ethiopia, Bolivia, Namibia, Paraguay, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Tunisia. Nepal and Maldives were removed from the list. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms If the situation in those does not improve, they could be added to the list of countries Israelis are banned from entering. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on Sunday appointed Roni Numa to oversee COVID-19 screening at Ben Gurion Airport and other international crossings — widely seen as one of the country’s weak points in curbing the spread of the virus. “The responsibility will be to deal with this now as well as look toward the future,” Bennett said. “Vaccinations do not always work. There can be variants, next month, next year or in four years, for which there is no vaccine. Therefore, in Israel, which does not have very many crossings — in effect it is a kind of island — there is no reason why we cannot protect ourselves even if there is no vaccine.” Advertisement Bennett has encouraged Israelis to avoid nonessential travel. There are currently 1,254 active COVID-19 cases in Israel, with 145 new infections diagnosed on Sunday after weeks in which the daily caseload remained in the low dozens. There are 22 people in serious condition from the disease.

News article:
Ten days after returning to the country, some 3,000 Israelis still have not received results for the coronavirus tests administered to them at Ben Gurion Airport, Israeli television reported Monday. The Health Ministry told Channel 12 it was aware of the problem and that only people who tested negative for COVID-19 have not received the results. Many other incoming travelers were reportedly not getting the results until two days after they were tested. The network noted that the delays came several weeks after a new company took over the testing apparatus at the airport. Unlike Check2Fly, the previous firm that managed the tests, the new company — Femi Premium — does not process the swab samples at the airport itself, but sends them to laboratories it does not operate itself. Additionally, these labs do not update arriving travelers about the results, but tell the Health Ministry. The ministry then informs health maintenance organizations, which update those insured by them. Check2Fly informed travelers directly. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms “There is no person whose test was positive and did not receive a response within 48 hours,” the Health Ministry said. The report came amid concerns over the entry of the more contagious Delta variant into the country and that infected travelers from overseas were helping fuel a renewed rise in coronavirus cases. Israelis who are vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 are exempt from quarantine upon returning to the country, unless returning from COVID-19 hotspots to which travel is barred. The countries that Israelis are currently banned from visiting are Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, India, Mexico, and Russia. Advertisement But according to Channel 12 news, travelers coming from those countries are arriving in Israel on private planes and entering without inspection. The report said that others coming from those countries on commercial flights are returning home from the airport using public transportation, posing a potential risk to those around them. Outgoing Health Ministry Director General Chezy Levy told the network that the situation at the airport “seems absurd,” admitting that results should ideally be given within 24 hours. The government on Sunday approved the issuing of a tender to set up a new coronavirus testing facility at Ben Gurion Airport, as part of efforts to increase testing capacity there. The network also aired a recording of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett imploring municipal leaders to encourage vaccination before some doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech shots that Israel acquired expire at the end of July. Bennett earlier Monday appealed to teenagers to get vaccinated by July 9. “To do the second shot by July 30, you need the first shot to be by July 9,” Bennett can be heard saying, referring to the 21-day period between doses. “It’s possible to also continue vaccinating after July 9, but then we’ll only get one shot, which is far less effective concerning the Delta variant.” He added: “It’s simply a crime not to get vaccinated in this window.” Advertisement Levy said Israel is looking to swap the doses set to expire next month for shots from other countries that have later expiration dates. He did not specify which countries. A separate report from the Kan public broadcaster said the ministry will destroy 800,000 vaccines worth hundreds of millions of dollars if no country agrees to purchase them in the next two weeks. Earlier this month, the Palestinian Authority agreed to, and then rejected, a deal for Israel to hand over the soon-to-expire vaccines in exchange for the PA’s shipment of fresh Pfizer shots, which are scheduled to arrive later in 2021. Health Ministry figures showed daily cases further rising, with 213 infections confirmed on Monday since midnight, up from the 145 recorded throughout the previous day. The number of active infection climbed to 1,425, though serious cases have continued to drop and were down to just 21. Another fatality — the second in two weeks — took the death toll to 6,430. There have been 841,184 infections since the pandemic began. Of the over 40,000 tests so far performed on Monday, 0.5% come back positive, up slightly from the 0.4% rate recorded over the past several days. To combat the rising infections, the Health Ministry reimposed the indoor mask mandate on Friday and the government has moved to tighten rules on travel, given concerns that the Delta variant was contributing to the recent surge. Meeting Sunday evening for the first time since the new government was sworn in, the coronavirus cabinet discussed increased testing and enforcement on Israel’s borders and a boosted effort to vaccinate teens — but did not add any major new restrictions.

Many other incoming travelers were reportedly not getting the results until two days after they were tested. The network noted that the delays came several weeks after a new company took over the testing apparatus at the airport. Unlike Check2Fly, the previous firm that managed the tests, the new company — Femi Premium — does not process the swab samples at the airport itself, but sends them to laboratories it does not operate itself. Additionally, these labs do not update arriving travelers about the results, but tell the Health Ministry. The ministry then informs health maintenance organizations, which update those insured by them. Check2Fly informed travelers directly.

The report came amid concerns over the entry of the more contagious Delta variant into the country and that infected travelers from overseas were helping fuel a renewed rise in coronavirus cases. Israelis who are vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 are exempt from quarantine upon returning to the country, unless returning from COVID-19 hotspots to which travel is barred. The countries that Israelis are currently banned from visiting are Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, India, Mexico, and Russia. Advertisement But according to Channel 12 news, travelers coming from those countries are arriving in Israel on private planes and entering without inspection. The report said that others coming from those countries on commercial flights are returning home from the airport using public transportation, posing a potential risk to those around them. Outgoing Health Ministry Director General Chezy Levy told the network that the situation at the airport “seems absurd,” admitting that results should ideally be given within 24 hours. The government on Sunday approved the issuing of a tender to set up a new coronavirus testing facility at Ben Gurion Airport, as part of efforts to increase testing capacity there. The network also aired a recording of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett imploring municipal leaders to encourage vaccination before some doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech shots that Israel acquired expire at the end of July. Bennett earlier Monday appealed to teenagers to get vaccinated by July 9. “To do the second shot by July 30, you need the first shot to be by July 9,” Bennett can be heard saying, referring to the 21-day period between doses. “It’s possible to also continue vaccinating after July 9, but then we’ll only get one shot, which is far less effective concerning the Delta variant.” He added: “It’s simply a crime not to get vaccinated in this window.” Advertisement Levy said Israel is looking to swap the doses set to expire next month for shots from other countries that have later expiration dates. He did not specify which countries. A separate report from the Kan public broadcaster said the ministry will destroy 800,000 vaccines worth hundreds of millions of dollars if no country agrees to purchase them in the next two weeks. Earlier this month, the Palestinian Authority agreed to, and then rejected, a deal for Israel to hand over the soon-to-expire vaccines in exchange for the PA’s shipment of fresh Pfizer shots, which are scheduled to arrive later in 2021. Health Ministry figures showed daily cases further rising, with 213 infections confirmed on Monday since midnight, up from the 145 recorded throughout the previous day. The number of active infection climbed to 1,425, though serious cases have continued to drop and were down to just 21. Another fatality — the second in two weeks — took the death toll to 6,430. There have been 841,184 infections since the pandemic began. Of the over 40,000 tests so far performed on Monday, 0.5% come back positive, up slightly from the 0.4% rate recorded over the past several days. To combat the rising infections, the Health Ministry reimposed the indoor mask mandate on Friday and the government has moved to tighten rules on travel, given concerns that the Delta variant was contributing to the recent surge. Meeting Sunday evening for the first time since the new government was sworn in, the coronavirus cabinet discussed increased testing and enforcement on Israel’s borders and a boosted effort to vaccinate teens — but did not add any major new restrictions.

News article:
The number of adolescent getting vaccinated against the coronavirus has risen sharply in recent days, raising hopes that a large portion of the country’s minors eligible for shots will be protected against COVID-19 in coming weeks. As of Tuesday morning, nearly 32 percent of Israelis in the 10-19 age bracket had received at least one dose of the vaccine, up from around 23% a week earlier, Health Ministry data showed. Authorities launched a renewed drive to vaccinate teens aged 12 to 15 last week, responding to mounting numbers of new cases, many of them attributed to the fast-spreading Delta variant of the virus. Since then, the number of shots distributed daily has climbed to back over 10,000 for the first time since early April. That’s when Israel’s world-leading vaccination drive stalled after distributing the vaccine to nearly 5 million people, the majority of its eligible population. On Monday, over 14,314 people received the first dose of the vaccine, up from 13,513 people who received the first dose a day earlier, according to Health Ministry data. Over 11,000 first doses were distributed by noon Tuesday. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The vast majority of those getting the shot in recent days fall into the 10-19 age category, according to official figures, which only go to Saturday. On June 24, 9,866 people in the age bracket received a first dose of the vaccine, representing over 83% of everyone getting the first shot that day. Similar percentages have been seen on other days as well. Among those getting vaccinated on Tuesday was Michal Bennett, the 14-year-old daughter of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. The premier tweeted a picture of his daughter and called on others to go get vaccinated. גם מיכל שלי התחסנה עכשיו. גאה בך מיכלי❤️ Advertisement ומה איתכם? קרדיט צילום: נמרוד גליקמן – דוברות כללית, מחוז שרון שומרון pic.twitter.com/io1SYXKLw5 — Naftali Bennett בנט (@naftalibennett) June 29, 2021 “The Delta disease can harm those who are not vaccinated, and that is the children,” Bennett said Tuesday while touring a youth vaccination center in Holon. He set a goal of 30,000 vaccines a day for the next 10 days. According to reports, Israel has 1.4 million doses set to expire at the end of next month and Bennett is hoping to use as many of them as possible by getting 300,000 children vaccinated by July 9, leaving enough time for a second dose from the expiring batch as well. Advertisement Three of Israel’s four major health funds say that around 50 percent of their members aged 12 to 15 will be protected from the virus by next month, adding together those who have been vaccinated, those who have scheduled vaccinations, and those who have recovered from the disease, Channel 12 news reported Tuesday. Israel okayed the vaccine for 12-to-15-year-olds in early June, but authorities only began encouraging vaccinations for the age group last week in response to rising case numbers. Israel in recent days has seen daily caseload levels climb to levels not seen since April. Nearly 300 cases were confirmed on Monday and another 287 were reported by Tuesday evening. The hospitalization rate has remained low, however, with only 22 people hospitalized in serious condition as of Tuesday, the ministry said. Many experts consider hospitalizations to be better than total case numbers for measuring an area’s health. “So long as there’s no serious morbidity, we can continue to live our lives as normally as possible,” Dr. Arnon Afek, head of Sheba-Tel Hashomer Medical Center near Tel Aviv told Army Radio Tuesday. Nonetheless, some officials have reportedly expressed fears that the number of seriously ill will rise, with Israel unprepared to deal with the influx. “The staff are tired, frustrated and still haven’t had a chance to recover. They simply won’t be able to handle it. It will be a catastrophe,” an unnamed health official was quoted telling the Ynet news website. The Delta variant of the virus, first identified in India, is more contagious than other variants and may be better able to bypass vaccines, but apparently does not cause serious infection. The transmissibility of the Delta variant over the original strain is around 40%, according to the United Kingdom’s Public Health agency. The effectiveness of two vaccine doses for protection from hospitalization is at 96%, according to the agency. Advertisement With case numbers rising, Israel has thus far reimposed an indoor mask mandate and cracked down on travelers arriving from countries with high infection rates or breaking quarantine, but has sought to avoid a return to the restrictions it has largely emerged from over the last two months. “We can beat the current coronavirus wave without restrictions,” Bennett said Tuesday. “Vaccinations instead of lockdowns, masks instead of restrictions.”

The image shows a graph of the number of people in Israel who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus, by age group. The graph shows that the number of people who have been vaccinated has increased in recent weeks, and that the majority of people who have been vaccinated are in the 16-19 age group. This is consistent with the news article, which reports that the number of adolescents getting vaccinated against the coronavirus has risen sharply in recent days. The image also shows that the number of people who have been vaccinated is higher in the younger age groups, which is consistent with the news article, which reports that the majority of people who have been vaccinated are in the 10-19 age bracket.

News article:
Israel is holding negotiations with the United Kingdom to broker a COVID-19 vaccine swap deal, according to an Israeli television report Wednesday. Under the exchange, Israel, which currently has an excess of doses, would ship around 1 million of its Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that are due to expire on July 30 to the UK, Channel 12 news reported. In exchange, the Health Ministry would receive an equivalent number of vaccines that the UK is slated to receive from Pfizer in September. The network described the talks on the proposed deal as “advanced” and said the shipments could begin as soon as next week. Israel is said to have around 1.4 million doses set to expire at the end of next month. Israel is also reportedly seeking answers from Pfizer on whether it can use the vaccines it already has past their declared expiration date. But without a clear answer, the network said Israel was warning it will not offer the first COVID shot to Israelis after July 9, since there will not be unexpired vaccines for their second dose three weeks later.

On Monday, Kan news reported that the Health Ministry would destroy at least 800,000 expiring coronavirus vaccine doses if no buyers are found for them in the next two weeks. The vaccine doses are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the broadcaster.

As of Wednesday evening, Health Ministry figures showed 5,587,320 people out of Israel’s population of some 9.3 million have gotten their first vaccine shot. Of those, 5,167,674 received their second dose. The ministry also reported 224 new cases since midnight, bringing the number of active infections to 1,882.

Topic: Security Region: Asia Tags: ChinaIranXi JinpingDefenseForeign Policy Ahead of Xi’s visit to Tehran, Sino-Iranian military cooperation looks to expand. China is often regarded as one of the prime beneficiaries of the Iran nuclear deal, signed in July 2015 with the P5+1 countries. Under the deal, Iran will limit its uranium enrichment and make other changes to its nuclear program in exchange for the termination of sanctions. This potential opening could provide Chinese state-owned energy companies a chance to increase their involvement with Iran’s oil and natural gas industries, and Iran could become a more important export market for a range of Chinese products. Beijing may also assist Tehran in building infrastructure as part of the massive Eurasian development project known as “One Belt, One Road,” as well as offer financing through the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Many agreements are likely to be announced during Chinese president Xi Jinping’s inaugural visit to Iran, planned for late January. A more worrisome, but overlooked, aspect of China’s growing ties with Iran could occur in the arms sector. A bit of historical context is needed here. In the 1980s and early 1990s, China was a major supplier of advanced weapons to Iran in areas ranging from tanks and fighter jets to fast-attack patrol craft and anti-ship missiles. Beijing was driven not only by profit motivations, but also, it seems, by a strategic desire to strengthen Iran as a bulwark against excessive U.S. influence in the Middle East. Chinese arms sales to Iran gradually declined in the late 1990s and 2000s, due to pressure from the United States and the imposition of UN sanctions against Iran. Those sanctions initially prohibited involvement with Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile industries, and were later expanded to cover major conventional weapons, such as combat aircraft and warships. Iran was also increasingly seen as a ‘pariah state,’ a status symbolized by the UN embargo, which discouraged China from maintaining overly close security ties with Tehran. Consequently, China’s arms relationship with Iran has been left largely moribund in the past decade. The Iran nuclear deal could spawn a resurgence of Chinese arms exports to Iran by lifting UN sanctions and helping diminish Iran’s ‘pariah state’ status. China, and other states, would be allowed to export major conventional weapons to Iran in the next eight years with UN Security Council approval. After eight years, even those restrictions would be lifted, assuming Iran complies with the agreement. In addition, certain types of weapons could be sold to Iran without a waiver. For instance, Russia has argued that its sale of S-300 missile defenses to Iran are permissible because this system is not specifically prohibited under the nuclear deal. China could make a similar argument regarding small arms, short-range missiles and other systems. In the coming years, China might attempt to sell a wide variety of advanced arms to Iran. These could include J-10 fighters, the possible sale of which has been reported in Chinese media. Another system would be the Houbei-class high-speed missile boat, which China is also poised to sell to Pakistan. This would be a logical choice given the expanding navy-to-navy relationship between China and Iran. China might also transfer advanced cruise missiles and technical know-how, allowing Iran to improve its domestic cruise missile program. Other systems could include UAVs, space and counter-space weapons, missile defense components and electronic warfare systems. Sales of most of these items would likely require UN approval, which China might attempt to secure as a permanent member of the Security Council. The implications of enhanced Sino-Iranian arms cooperation for the United States and regional security could be significant. Provision of high-speed missile boats, anti-ship missiles, and other systems would allow Iran to strengthen its “anti-access/area-denial” (A2/AD) capabilities—referring to the ability to hold U.S. forces at bay in the event of a crisis. Indeed, China would be in an excellent position to assist Iran in enhancing its A2/AD capabilities since Beijing has been developing weapons of just this sort to counter U.S. intervention—notably in the context of a crisis in the Taiwan Strait. For instance, Iran could use Chinese-supplied arms to increase the threat to U.S. naval ships in the Strait of Hormuz, a strategically vital channel for Gulf state oil exports to world markets. Iran might also use these weapons to conduct additional provocative exercises explicitly targeting U.S. forces in the region. In February 2015, Iranian forces destroyed a mock U.S. aircraft carrier using high-speed boats, shoulder-launched rockets, and cruise missiles. In December, Iran test-fired a missile within 1500 yards of the U.S. carrier Harry S. Truman, which was transiting the Strait of Hormuz. Chinese support could lead to a continuation or expansion of such destabilizing activities. Chinese military assistance could also enable Iran to improve its long-range missile capabilities, which could endanger more distant U.S. military targets, such as U.S. facilities on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia. China has pledged to adhere to Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) guidelines limiting transfer of components and technologies that can be used in long-range ballistic and cruise missiles, but its compliance with its commitments has sometimes been problematic. Chinese arms exports to Iran could also pose proliferation concerns. For instance, as part of its effort to expand influence in the region, Iran could elect to re-export weapons to states such as Syria, where Tehran is militarily supporting the Assad regime. Iran may also transfer Chinese-made arms to terrorist groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as to Shi’a militias in Iraq. These groups could in turn use Iran-supplied arms to strike military and civilian targets. Of course, Chinese foreign ministry officials would likely push against a significant resumption of arms sales to Iran. Doing so would pose a challenge to China’s desire for positive relations with the United States. Major arms sales would also needlessly disrupt China’s relations with a variety of other states in the region that are on poor terms with Tehran, such as Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Turkey. Some Chinese firms may also be cautious about running afoul of U.S. sanctions, which will continue to target Iran on human rights and counter-terrorism grounds. However, the People’s Liberation Army and Chinese arms manufacturers may lobby in favor of renewed arms exports to Iran. As in the past, some Chinese military strategists could portray arms sales as a way to counter U.S. ‘hegemony’ in the Middle East and build a more multi-polar world order. For their part, Chinese arms traders could seek to retain their competitive advantage by exploiting an important new market. Ultimately, it would be up to China’s top leaders, including President Xi Jinping, to arbitrate between these different perspectives and decide whether and how to re-engage Iran in the arms sector. The United States can take steps to mitigate the risks of a resurgence of Sino-Iranian arms cooperation. Washington should work with Britain, France, and other partners in the UN Security Council to deny waivers for sales of major conventional weapons to Iran. Continuing U.S. sanctions on Iran should also be vigorously enforced, as should potential new sanctions on Iran’s ballistic missile program. U.S. officials should also press their Chinese counterparts to avoid selling the most advanced systems to Iran and to adhere strictly to MTCR limits on missile technology exports. The argument should be that greatly improved military capabilities could allow Tehran to conduct a more brazen and bellicose foreign policy. This would undermine China’s enduring need for stability in a region from which it continues to receive over half of its oil supply. Thus, Beijing’s restraint on arms sales would not only avoid tensions with Washington and many others, including Riyadh and Tel Aviv, but would also fundamentally support China’s own strategic interests.

News article:
(Recasts, adds details, context, changes slug) BEIJING, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping will make an unusual visit next week to Saudi Arabia and Iran, who are locked in a bitter dispute, in what could be a bid by Beijing to act as an “honest broker” as it seeks a greater regional diplomatic role. While relying on the region for oil supplies, China has tended to leave Middle Eastern diplomacy to the other four permanent members of the U.N. Security Council - the United States, Britain, France and Russia. But China has been trying to get more involved, especially in Syria, recently hosting both its foreign minister and opposition officials. In a brief statement, China’s Foreign Ministry said Xi would visit Saudi Arabia, Iran and Egypt on his Jan. 19-23 visit. It provided no other details. A Chinese president has not visited Saudi Arabia since 2009 when Hu Jintao went, and Jiang Zemin was the last Chinese president to visit Iran, going in 2002. Tensions between the Sunni Muslim kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Shi’ite Muslim Iran have escalated since Saudi authorities executed Shi’ite cleric Nimr al-Nimr on Jan. 2, triggering outrage among Shi’ites across the Middle East. In response, Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran and its consulate in Mashhad, prompting Riyadh to sever relations. Tehran then cut all commercial ties with Riyadh, and banned pilgrims from travelling to Mecca. Last week, a Chinese envoy visited Saudi Arabia and Iran, where he called for both countries to exercise calm and restraint amid their on-going feud. “China is trying to present itself as an honest broker between Saudi and Iran, much as it has done between the Syrian government and opposition,” said one Beijing-based diplomat, who is familiar with China’s Middle East policy. Li Shaoxian, vice president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, a government think-tank, said China had to step up to the plate in the Middle East, but stressed China’s role would be different from other superpowers. “The Middle East is a touchstone for major powers,” Li said. “Whether it is a graveyard depends on whether a country seeks hegemony,” Li said, adding that was not China’s intention. The Middle East, however, is fraught with risk for China, a country that has little experience navigating the religious and political tensions that frequently wrack the region. Diplomatic sources said the Iran and Saudi trips had originally been mooted for last year. But it was cancelled after a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Muslim allies began air strikes in Yemen against the Iran-allied Shi’ite Houthi movement, as China apparently did not want to be seen to be taking sides in the Yemen civil war. China also has its own worries about radicalisation of the Muslim Uighur people who live in China’s far western region of Xinjiang, which has been beset by violence in recent years, blamed by Beijing on Islamist militants. This week, China said it wanted to develop deeper defence and anti-terrorism ties with the Arab world, including joint exercises, intelligence sharing and training. China says some Uighurs have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight with militant groups there. In November, Islamic State said it had killed a Chinese citizen it had taken hostage in the Middle East.

Last week, a Chinese envoy visited Saudi Arabia and Iran, where he called for both countries to exercise calm and restraint amid their on-going feud. “China is trying to present itself as an honest broker between Saudi and Iran, much as it has done between the Syrian government and opposition,” said one Beijing-based diplomat, who is familiar with China’s Middle East policy. Li Shaoxian, vice president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, a government think-tank, said China had to step up to the plate in the Middle East, but stressed China’s role would be different from other superpowers. “The Middle East is a touchstone for major powers,” Li said. “Whether it is a graveyard depends on whether a country seeks hegemony,” Li said, adding that was not China’s intention. The Middle East, however, is fraught with risk for China, a country that has little experience navigating the religious and political tensions that frequently wrack the region. Diplomatic sources said the Iran and Saudi trips had originally been mooted for last year. But it was cancelled after a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Muslim allies began air strikes in Yemen against the Iran-allied Shi’ite Houthi movement, as China apparently did not want to be seen to be taking sides in the Yemen civil war.

This week, China said it wanted to develop deeper defence and anti-terrorism ties with the Arab world, including joint exercises, intelligence sharing and training. China says some Uighurs have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight with militant groups there. In November, Islamic State said it had killed a Chinese citizen it had taken hostage in the Middle East.

News article:
(Recasts, adds details, context, changes slug) BEIJING, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping will make an unusual visit next week to Saudi Arabia and Iran, who are locked in a bitter dispute, in what could be a bid by Beijing to act as an “honest broker” as it seeks a greater regional diplomatic role. While relying on the region for oil supplies, China has tended to leave Middle Eastern diplomacy to the other four permanent members of the U.N. Security Council - the United States, Britain, France and Russia. But China has been trying to get more involved, especially in Syria, recently hosting both its foreign minister and opposition officials. In a brief statement, China’s Foreign Ministry said Xi would visit Saudi Arabia, Iran and Egypt on his Jan. 19-23 visit. It provided no other details. A Chinese president has not visited Saudi Arabia since 2009 when Hu Jintao went, and Jiang Zemin was the last Chinese president to visit Iran, going in 2002. Tensions between the Sunni Muslim kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Shi’ite Muslim Iran have escalated since Saudi authorities executed Shi’ite cleric Nimr al-Nimr on Jan. 2, triggering outrage among Shi’ites across the Middle East. In response, Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran and its consulate in Mashhad, prompting Riyadh to sever relations. Tehran then cut all commercial ties with Riyadh, and banned pilgrims from travelling to Mecca. Last week, a Chinese envoy visited Saudi Arabia and Iran, where he called for both countries to exercise calm and restraint amid their on-going feud. “China is trying to present itself as an honest broker between Saudi and Iran, much as it has done between the Syrian government and opposition,” said one Beijing-based diplomat, who is familiar with China’s Middle East policy.

China Gears Up to Play Bigger Role in Middle East Politics by Saibal Dasgupta January 14, 2016 Chinese President Xi Jinping's first official visit to the Middle East next week is a signal of Beijing's intention to be a major player in Mideast affairs, analysts say. The Chinese government has not yet announced specifics of Xi's Mideast tour. But official agencies in Iran and Egypt say he will visit the region beginning January 20. This would be the first time in 12 years a Chinese president will visit the two countries. Xi is also expected to visit Saudi Arabia. China, has been signaling its growing interest in dealing with thorny issues in the Middle East. Beijing issued its first ever policy paper on the Arab world on Wednesday, promising to support Arab governments in their fight against terrorism through long-term security cooperation, intelligence sharing and technical cooperation. In December it hosted Syrian Deputy Prime Minister Walid al-Moallem, and also representatives of the Syrian opposition. Beijing recently sent Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Ming to Saudi Arabia and Iran to help lower tension caused by the execution of a controversial Shi'ite cleric and the attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran. The recent moves sparked speculation that China might send its troops to Syria to fight alongside Russian soldiers. Analysts are asking why China wants to step into a diplomatic mine field that poses serious risks. "If you are able to make a difference in the Middle East, you will be regarded as a major country. China faces restrictions in the Middle East, but it is ready to play its role," said Li Shaoxian, vice president of Institute of Contemporary International Relations, a government-run think tank. But Li says, 'Unlike Russia, China has no need or aspirations for a military role. We can accept anything that is in line with the desires of local people in another country.' China is worried that disruptive events in the Middle East may impact the thinking in its vast Muslim population. It is possible that thousands of Chinese Muslims have migrated to fight for different forces in Syria, he said. Managing contradictions Analysts say there are signs Chinese leaders are determined to get a taste of managing disputes in the Middle East, which it has avoided for decades. One in particular is its effort to be friendly with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders. "China is trying to strike a delicate balance. It wants to support the Palestinian cause because this will earn it respect and sympathy in the Middle East. But it cannot turn its back on the useful technologies that Israel can supply," Daud Abdullah, director of the London-based Middle East Monitor told VOA. "We know, for instance, that Israel has been covertly supplying to China the arms know-how it acquired from the U.S." Most analysts believe China will tread carefully, because taking sides in the tumultuous Mideast can have negative repercussions in its own region of Xinjiang, which is a hotbed of Islamic terrorism. For example, it is careful not to take a stance that would displease Turkey because Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang are Turkic speaking people. "I think China is trying to find a political role for itself in the Middle East. It is difficult for China to stay neutral, but it is going to give it a try," Francesco Sisci, professor at the Renmin University in Beijing, said. Economic motives The Middle East is important because the region is one of the three routes chosen for China's Silk Road program, which is expected to boost the Chinese economy in a big way, Sisci said. "Beijing will try to be neutral with regard to tensions among Iran, Saudi Arabia and Syria. But they want China to take a more clear cut stance," Hichem Karoui, political adviser at the Diplomatic Institute at Qatar, said. Li cited three other reasons why China wants to play a major role in the Middle East. More than half of China's energy imports come from the region. It is an important aspect of the Silk Road program, which involves building infrastructure projects across several countries. And it is essential to play an important role in the Middle East to be taken seriously as a major power, he said. NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
(MENAFN- Daily News Egypt) China will continue to adopt a balanced approach to its engagement with the Middle East, according to Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Ming Monday. The announcement comes days before a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Iran and Saudi Arabia, a visit that is thought to signal a change in the Chinese government's policy in the region. Diplomatic tension between the region's two competing powers was ignited anew when Saudi Arabia executed prominent Shi'a cleric Nimr Al-Nimr. This was followed by attacks on Saudi diplomatic buildings in Iran by angry protestors. Saudi Arabia responded to the attacks on its diplomatic mission by severing all diplomatic ties with Iran. Zhang confirmed that China is a disinterested party in the conflict. "Regarding some of the region's problems, China has always taken a balanced and just position," he said. "The world won't be calm unless the Middle East is stable. No country can achieve development without being stable," Zhang continued. China depends on the Middle East to provide oil to its growing economy; however, it has never interfered with Middle Eastern politics, allowing other permanent UN Security Council members to address issues that have arisen. The Chinese vice foreign minister confirmed that his country will cooperate with Iran in energy production, after sanctions were lifted from the country last year. The official Chinese news agency, Xinhua, reported that China plans for Iran to be a part of the New Silk Road initiative to develop trade routes across Asia. "After the sanctions lift, Iran's economy can develop faster, but it needs the technological support to update its infrastructure," the report read. Iran experienced its first day without sanctions Sunday, after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed Iran's commitment to its deal with the West. Last week, Zhang Ming visited both Riyadh and Tehran and urged both countries to ease the hostilities. Zhang addressed possible methods to resolve the current tensions and repeated his message in Tehran, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry. In the past month, China hosted members from both the Syrian regime and the opposition to urge both sides to find a solution to the Syrian civil war. China is considered to be a safeguarding force of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad. It voted against UN resolutions aimed at addressing the Syrian crisis four times. China published its first official Arab policy paper, claiming to "support Arab countries" struggling to uphold sovereignty and territorial integrity, pursue and safeguard national interests, and combat external interference and aggression. Within this framework, it emphasised its support for the Arab league in its effort to establish an independent Palestinian state. The Chinese president will also visit Egypt during his trip to the Middle East. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi highlighted the importance of the Chinese president's visit to Cairo. In a meeting with Prime Minister Sherif Ismail and the ministers of trade, transportation and housing, President Al-Sisi discussed the projects to be established in cooperation with China. Conversation also addressed the manner in which Egypt can participate in China's New Silk Road initiative. Emanuele Scimia, a foreign affairs analyst at the South China Morning Post believes that China is trying to moderately change its non-interference policy in the Middle East and North Africa and shift to a more assertive engagement in the region. According to Scimia, soft-power diplomacy alone will not be enough for China to realise its aims. "The problem for Beijing is that diplomacy can hinge on trade and investment, but it must also be supported by military presence: something that China lacks at the moment," Scimia told the Daily News Egypt.

Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Riyadh Tuesday, launching a three-country tour, four-day tour of the Middle East, as China aims to build up both political and economic ties with countries there. China issued its first official Arab Policy Paper Wednesday, which described itself as a "blueprint for China-Arab mutually beneficial cooperation, and reiterates the political will of commitment to peace and stability in the Middle East, in order to promote China-Arab relations to a new and higher level." Xi's visit, which was scheduled to last from Tuesday through Saturday, will include visits to Egypt and Iran.

As for Iran, his visit was aimed at ushering in "a new era of bilateral ties featuring comprehensive, long-term and stable development," Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Ming said Monday. Xi's visit to Iran comes shortly after sanctions were lifted on Iran after the International Atomic Energy Agency declared that Tehran had abided by the terms of a nuclear deal, in whose negotiations China was involved, and cut back on its nuclear program. "Different in natural endowment and development level, China and Arab countries are all in an important development stage," China's new policy paper said. "We need to collaborate with each other more closely, and learn from each other...so as to safeguard state sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and to promote stability, economic development and well-being of our peoples." Fields China envisioned cooperation on ranged from investment and trade to energy, infrastructure and healthcare, according to the paper. It added that China would support "positive efforts" by Arab countries to "[curb] the spread of extremist thoughts and [fight] terrorism."

With relations between Beijing and Riyadh anchored by Saudi Arabia's extensive oil exports to China (totaling 1/6 of China's overall imports), it is Xi's visit to Tehran, scheduled for the end of his trip, which has analysts worried. This will be the first visit by a Chinese leader to Iran in nearly a decade and a half, and comes right on time for Beijing, the newspaper suggests. "The trip comes just days after the lifting of international sanctions on Iran under the Obama administration-backed nuclear accord that went into effect over the weekend, and analysts say Beijing is eager to get in on the ground floor as the Iranian government scrambles to end its diplomatic isolation and ink deals with foreign investors," The Washington Times writes. Furthermore, with tensions between Riyadh and Tehran on the rise, "some believe Mr. Xi's goal is to promote a message that both Riyadh and Tehran would be wise to embrace China – not Washington – as the partner of the future."

News article:
Chinese President Xi Jinping, the first head of state visiting Iran since sanctions were lifted on Tehran, is poised to sign letters of intent with the Islamic Republic for a new chapter in strategic economic cooperation. Xi, who arrived in Tehran on Friday night, was officially welcomed by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Saturday. The Chinese leader, who made great contribution to the signature of Iran’s landmark deal with world powers last July, hopes to further boost his country’s traditional friendship and economic engagement with Iran. China, a top oil consumer, has been a top buyer of Iran’s crude. Even after international sanctions targeted Tehran’s energy sector, China continued its cooperation with Iran by purchasing oil and developing energy projects. Upon arrival in Tehran, Xi said that Iran and China, whose friendship dates back to 2,000 years ago, have made important contribution to human progress. He said establishment of political relations between Iran and China has resulted in important achievements in the political, economic and cultural sectors. Iran and China signed 17 documents for cooperation in economic, industrial, cultural and judicial fields in the presence of the two countries’ presidents. The documents included one signed between Iranian and Chinese nuclear chiefs for peaceful energy cooperation. Others involved documents for environmental cooperation, financing of a bullet train railway and banking cooperation. The Chinese president’s trip to Tehran is the last leg of his three-nation tour which has also taken him to Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The value of trade transactions between Tehran and Beijing stood at some $52 billion in 2014. However, the figure dropped in 2015 due to decreasing oil prices. ‘New chapter’ Xi said, “In cooperation with the Iranian side and by benefiting from the current favorable conditions, China is ready to upgrade the level of bilateral relations and cooperation so that a new chapter will start in bilateral relations in the long term.” Iranian and Chinese presidents preside over a high-level meeting in Tehran on January 23, 2016. (president.ir) He noted that the two countries have been on the same wavelength with regard to regional and international affairs. During his visit, Xi is scheduled to hold talks with Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei. China remains Iran’s top trade partner. According to China’s Commerce Department, during the first 11 months of 2015, China imported 24.36 million tons of crude oil from Iran, or 8 percent of its total imports. China’s oil companies have also been increasing investment in oil projects overseas. The North Azadegan Oil Field, located along Iran-Iraq border, is one example of cooperation projects led by China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). Following the recent removal of sanctions, Iran is once again open to global business, which makes the market more competitive as many global companies are already moving to resume trade with Iran.

News article:
Chinese President Xi Jinping, the first head of state visiting Iran since sanctions were lifted on Tehran, is poised to sign letters of intent with the Islamic Republic for a new chapter in strategic economic cooperation. Xi, who arrived in Tehran on Friday night, was officially welcomed by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Saturday. The Chinese leader, who made great contribution to the signature of Iran’s landmark deal with world powers last July, hopes to further boost his country’s traditional friendship and economic engagement with Iran. China, a top oil consumer, has been a top buyer of Iran’s crude. Even after international sanctions targeted Tehran’s energy sector, China continued its cooperation with Iran by purchasing oil and developing energy projects. Upon arrival in Tehran, Xi said that Iran and China, whose friendship dates back to 2,000 years ago, have made important contribution to human progress. He said establishment of political relations between Iran and China has resulted in important achievements in the political, economic and cultural sectors. Iran and China signed 17 documents for cooperation in economic, industrial, cultural and judicial fields in the presence of the two countries’ presidents. The documents included one signed between Iranian and Chinese nuclear chiefs for peaceful energy cooperation. Others involved documents for environmental cooperation, financing of a bullet train railway and banking cooperation. The Chinese president’s trip to Tehran is the last leg of his three-nation tour which has also taken him to Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The value of trade transactions between Tehran and Beijing stood at some $52 billion in 2014. However, the figure dropped in 2015 due to decreasing oil prices. ‘New chapter’ Xi said, “In cooperation with the Iranian side and by benefiting from the current favorable conditions, China is ready to upgrade the level of bilateral relations and cooperation so that a new chapter will start in bilateral relations in the long term.” Iranian and Chinese presidents preside over a high-level meeting in Tehran on January 23, 2016. (president.ir) He noted that the two countries have been on the same wavelength with regard to regional and international affairs. During his visit, Xi is scheduled to hold talks with Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei. China remains Iran’s top trade partner. According to China’s Commerce Department, during the first 11 months of 2015, China imported 24.36 million tons of crude oil from Iran, or 8 percent of its total imports. China’s oil companies have also been increasing investment in oil projects overseas. The North Azadegan Oil Field, located along Iran-Iraq border, is one example of cooperation projects led by China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). Following the recent removal of sanctions, Iran is once again open to global business, which makes the market more competitive as many global companies are already moving to resume trade with Iran.

Rouhani said that the Islamic Republic welcomes stronger ties with China particularly after the recent lifting of international sanctions on Iran.

News article:
Xi Jinping's Charm Offensive: China Extends a Helping Hand to the Mideast Sputnik News 13:04 22.01.2016(updated 13:36 22.01.2016) Chinese President Xi Jinping is visiting Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Iran as part of a five-day trip, which has seen Beijing ink billion-dollar deals and boost ties in the Middle East at a time when Washington's presence in the oil-rich region is becoming less pronounced. Xi's tour is largely focused on economic and energy cooperation with the Arab world, the South China Morning Post noted. But 'it is also a mission to forge closer political, diplomatic and military ties with countries and to promote China's image and influence as a global power, resembling what the Middle Kingdom was 2,000 years ago,' the newspaper asserted. Xi's tour first brought him to Saudi Arabia, China's largest oil supplier, earlier this week. The Chinese president and King Salman agreed to foster energy cooperation between the two countries and oversaw the opening of a major Yanbu oil refinery, a joint Saudi Aramco and Sinopec venture. In addition, China announced that it plans to finalize 'a comprehensive free trade agreement' with the Gulf Cooperation Council later this year. The talks on the issue were launched in 2004, but the process was suspended in 2009. Xi later traveled to Egypt. China's state-run news agency Xinhua described the ties between the two countries as a 'comprehensive strategic partnership.' Incidentally, the same formula was applied with regard to China's relations with the oil kingdom and Iran. The two-day visit of the Chinese president to the North African nation produced more than 20 agreements covering civil aviation, electricity, higher education, science, media, banking and trade. The Chinese president also said that Beijing plans to invest as much as $15 billion in Egypt's economy as both countries agreed to promote cooperation under Xi's signature foreign policy initiative, known as the One Belt, One Road. Ahead of his visit to the Islamic Republic, Xi noted that Beijing wants 'to strengthen strategic cooperation with Iran.' He also announced plans to provide humanitarian aid to Syria, Libya, Yemen, Lebanon and Jordan amounting to almost $35 million in 2016. Xi's tour comes a week after Beijing unveiled its first official strategy towards the Middle East. Known as the Arab Policy Paper, the document called for greater political, economic, energy and security cooperation with the region. Relations between China and the Arab world, according to the brief, should be based on the One Belt, One Road development strategy. © Sputnik NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Saturday hailed a "new chapter" in relations with China after talks with President Xi Jinping, who is touring the region to boost Beijing's economic influence. The Asian giant and the Middle East's foremost Shiite power aim to build economic ties worth up to $600 billion within the next 10 years, Rouhani announced. The two leaders oversaw the signing of 17 agreements in areas including politics, the economy, security and cooperation on peaceful nuclear energy. "With the Chinese president's visit to Tehran and our agreements, a new chapter has begun in Tehran-Beijing relations," Rouhani said in a televised speech, flanked by Xi. It is the first visit to Iran by a Chinese president in 14 years, according to state news agency IRNA, and comes just days after sanctions against Tehran were lifted under a historic nuclear deal with world powers. "Iran is China's major partner in the Middle East and the two countries have chosen to boost bilateral relations," IRNA quoted Xi as saying. "China and Iran are two important developing countries that must continue regional and international cooperation," Xi added. Beijing has long taken a backseat to other diplomatic players in the Middle East but analysts say the region is crucial to Xi's signature foreign policy initiative -- known as "One Belt One Road" -- touted as a revival of ancient Silk Road trade routes. China, the world's second-largest economy, also relies heavily on energy imports from the Middle East. Beijing is Tehran's top customer for oil exports, which in recent years were hit by U.S. and EU sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program. Trade between the two countries was worth $52 billion in 2014. They did not give details of their goal of developing relations worth $600 billion over the next decade. According to Iranian media, more than a third of Iran's foreign trade is carried out with China. - 'Constructive role' -The two presidents issued a joint statement outlining a long-term "comprehensive strategic partnership". The two countries agreed to enhance cooperation including in fossil and renewable energy, transportation, railways, ports, industry, commerce and services, said the statement, published by Mehr news agency. China has committed to "invest and finance upstream and downstream energy projects in Iran," it said. China "acknowledges Iran's constructive role in the fight against terrorism and maintaining peace and stability in the region," it added, while supporting Tehran's increased role in regional and international affairs. China, along with the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia, was among the countries that reached the agreement with Iran in July to curtail its nuclear activities in exchange for ending international sanctions. Xi, accompanied by three deputy prime ministers and six ministers, also brought with him a large business delegation. He was scheduled to meet later Saturday with Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Xi's tour, his first of the Middle East as Chinese president, has also taken him to Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Riyadh and a number of Sunni Arab allies broke diplomatic ties with Iran this month after protesters angry over the execution of a prominent Shiite cleric ransacked Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran. In Cairo, Xi offered $55 billion in loans and investments to the Middle East, a region where China wants to strengthen its economic presence.

China, the world's second-largest economy, also relies heavily on energy imports from the Middle East. Beijing is Tehran's top customer for oil exports, which in recent years were hit by U.S. and EU sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program. Trade between the two countries was worth $52 billion in 2014. They did not give details of their goal of developing relations worth $600 billion over the next decade. According to Iranian media, more than a third of Iran's foreign trade is carried out with China. - 'Constructive role' -The two presidents issued a joint statement outlining a long-term "comprehensive strategic partnership". The two countries agreed to enhance cooperation including in fossil and renewable energy, transportation, railways, ports, industry, commerce and services, said the statement, published by Mehr news agency. China has committed to "invest and finance upstream and downstream energy projects in Iran," it said. China "acknowledges Iran's constructive role in the fight against terrorism and maintaining peace and stability in the region," it added, while supporting Tehran's increased role in regional and international affairs. China, along with the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia, was among the countries that reached the agreement with Iran in July to curtail its nuclear activities in exchange for ending international sanctions. Xi, accompanied by three deputy prime ministers and six ministers, also brought with him a large business delegation. He was scheduled to meet later Saturday with Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Xi's tour, his first of the Middle East as Chinese president, has also taken him to Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Riyadh and a number of Sunni Arab allies broke diplomatic ties with Iran this month after protesters angry over the execution of a prominent Shiite cleric ransacked Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran. In Cairo, Xi offered $55 billion in loans and investments to the Middle East, a region where China wants to strengthen its economic presence.

Sign 17 accords, including revival of old Silk Route; President Xi visits Tehran DUBAI: Iran and China agreed to expand bilateral ties and increase trade to $600 billion in the next 10 years, President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday during a visit to Tehran by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Xi is the second leader of a UN Security Council member to visit Tehran after the nuclear deal Iran struck with world powers last year. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Tehran in November. Iran emerged from years of economic isolation this month when the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog ruled it had curbed its nuclear programme, clearing the way for the lifting of UN, US, and European Union sanctions. “Iran and China have agreed to increase trade to $600 billion in the next 10 years,” Rouhani said at a news conference with Xi broadcast live on state television. “Iran and China have agreed on forming strategic relations (as) reflected in a 25-year comprehensive document,” he said. Iran and China signed 17 accords on Saturday, including on cooperation in nuclear energy and a revival of the ancient Silk Road trade route, known in China as One Belt, One Road. “China is still heavily dependent on Iran for its energy imports and Russia needs Iran in terms of its new security architecture vision for the Middle East,” said Ellie Geranmayeh, policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Iran plays quite an integral role for both China and Russia’s interests within the region, much more than it does for the Europeans,” Geranmayeh said. Xi was quoted as saying by China’s Xinhua news agency: “The China-Iran friendship...has stood the test of the vicissitudes of the international landscape. “The Chinese state-backed Global Times newspaper said in an editorial on Saturday that China hoped to improve ties with Iran as part of its sweeping plan to rebuild trade links with Europe and Asia and carve out new markets for its goods. “China is of course considering its self interest in strengthening cooperation with Iran, especially at a time when China is in the midst of expending efforts to push forward the One Belt, One Road initiative, Iran is an important fulcrum,” the paper said. Rouhani said the countries had also agreed to cooperate on “terrorism and extremism in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen”. Iran has called on China to join the fight against Daesh and play a more active role in the region.

News article:
By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin DUBAI (Reuters) — Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday called for closer economic and security ties with China, saying Iran had never trusted the West, as the two countries agreed to increase bilateral trade more than 10-fold to $600 billion in the next decade. Iran’s most powerful figure told Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit Iran wanted to expand ties with “more independent countries”, adding the United States was “not honest” in the fight against terrorism in the region. “Iranians never trusted the West… That’s why Tehran seeks cooperation with more independent countries (like China),” Khamenei said. “Iran is the most reliable country in the region for energy since its energy policies will never be affected by foreigners,” Khamenei was quoted by his official website as saying at a meeting with Xi. Xi is the second leader of a U.N. Security Council member to visit Tehran since the nuclear deal Iran struck with world powers last year. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Tehran in November. Iran emerged from years of economic isolation this month when the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog ruled it had curbed its nuclear program, clearing the way for the lifting of U.N., U.S., and European Union sanctions. “Iran and China have agreed to increase trade to $600 billion in the next 10 years,” President Hassan Rouhani said at a news conference with Xi broadcast live on state television. “Iran and China have agreed on forming strategic relations (as) reflected in a 25-year comprehensive document,” he said.

New Markets Khamenei said Iran would never forget Chinese cooperation’s during the sanctions. “The China-Iran friendship … has stood the test of the vicissitudes of the international landscape,” Xi was quoted as saying by China’s Xinhua news agency. The Chinese state-backed Global Times newspaper said in an editorial on Saturday that China hoped to improve ties with Iran as part of its sweeping plan to rebuild trade links with Europe and Asia and carve out new markets for its goods. “China is of course considering its self interest in strengthening cooperation with Iran, especially at a time when China is in the midst of expending efforts to push forward the One Belt, One Road initiative, Iran is an important fulcrum,” the paper said. While China seeks closer ties with Iran, earlier this week it signaled its support for Yemen’s government, which is fighting an Iran-allied militia, during Xi’s visit to Saudi Arabia, Iran’s rival for influence in the region. Iran has called on China to join the fight against the Islamic State militant group and play a more active role in the region. Tehran is widely credited with convincing Russia to start its military intervention in Syria and join the fight against Islamic State. “Although China and Russia backed U.N. sanctions against Iran on its nuclear program, they were also heavily pushing for special waivers to continue trading with Iran,” Geranmayeh said. “Iran had a relationship both politically and economically with China and Russia for the last ten years in ways that it hasn’t had with Europe. So it’s quite natural to see it opening up first to these countries.”

News article:
Dubai: Australia is putting trade relations with the Middle East in focus as the government tries to manage a widening budget deficit and a slowdown in its largest trading partner, China. This week, Australian Minister for Tourism and International Education, Senator Richard Colbeck, will visit Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE and Saudi Arabia to drum up interest in Australia’s health, education and tourism sectors. The visit, part of the country’s annual regional trade campaign, comes as Australia faces concerns a recession may be nearing, which could bring 24 years of consecutive economic growth to an end. After a decade long resource export boom, Australia’s economy is having to rebalance itself to weaker demand in China and falling commodity prices globally. Senator Colbeck, who is also Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade, told Gulf News in an interview in Dubai on Sunday that the slowdown in China is one reason Australia is looking to boost the presence of its services industry in the Middle East. On Sunday, Senator Colbeck oversaw the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between Australia and a Dubai governmental department, Dubai Exports, to facilitate trade for manufacturers, exports, traders and service providers. Generating new demand of its services sector would be of significant benefit to Australia’s economy. The services sector accounts for 70 per cent of the Australian economy and even more for employment, but contracted in the last quarter of 2015. The contraction came as the government said last month that the deficit in 2015-2016 will reach 37.4 billion Australian dollars (Dh96 billion), up from a previous forecast of A$35.1 billion. In fact, its deficit will widen every year on previous estimates to at least 2018-2019 when it’s now projected to reach A$14.2 billion, up from A$6.9 billion. But while Australia is looking for Middle East trade to boost its economy, that currently accounts for just A$16 billion in bilateral trade a year compared to $213 billion with China. Meanwhile, the Australian economy is now expected to grow by 2.5 per cent in 2015-2016, not 2.75 per cent as previously thought. For 2018-2019, it has been revised to 3 per cent, down from 3.5 per cent. Free trade negotiations In ministerial meetings this week, Senator Colbeck will push to restart Free Trade Agreement negotiations with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The GCC, which is Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, froze all FTA negotiations in 2009. “We’re very, very keen to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the GCC countries … we think that’s a big opportunity for us,” he said, adding that Australia is “anxious to start negotiating.” Senator Colbeck’s agenda includes meeting with UAE Minister of Economy Sultan Bin Saeed Al Mansouri and Chief Executive and Executive Director of Dubai-sovereign wealth fund Investment Corporation of Dubai Mohammad Al Shaibani. He is also believed to be meeting with Qatar’s Ministry of Economy in Doha. Australia is keen on sealing an FTA with the GCC following similar agreements with China, Japan and South Korea in 2014. Australia’s government hopes an FTA will increase trade and investment, particularly in Australian infrastructure, agriculture and tourism projects. “It’s very important for our country that we do have a strong flow of investment from outside Australia. There isn’t enough capital within our country to do a lot of the development we need to do.” Senator Colbeck said. Senior negotiator Gulf countries are already major foreign investors in Australia. The UAE is Australia’s 15th largest trading partner and 10th biggest foreign investor, including in ports, airports and electricity networks. But while Australia may be pushing this week for GCC-FTA talks, its senior negotiator Trade Minister Andrew Robb, who spearheaded the agreements with China, Japan and South Korea, is missing from the delegation. Senator Colbeck dismissed suggestions the absence of Minister Robb, a senior minister compared to Senator Colbeck, is a sign that Australia is waning interest in GCC negotiations. Australia is also negotiating an FTA with India. “I’ve been appointed as the minister assisting Andrew [Robb] in those trade negotiations so I don’t necessarily see that it sends any particular signal at all. We have a minister here, we have 80-odd businesses and institutions with us. We’re very, very keen and I’ll be conducting those discussions and negotiations with all the vigour I can muster,” he said. Next week, an Australian delegation of 25 companies led by a Saudi-based official will visit Egypt as part of the trade campaign. Facbox: Australian Middle East trade won’t pivot to Iran Australia’s trade and investment priorities in the Middle East are unlikely to change following the lifting of sanctions against Iran earlier this month, a government minister told Gulf News Sunday. “I don’t think we forget our good friends ... We have very good relationships here. We know the business community. We have good relationships with government. I don’t think that in any sense there is any thought or value in forgetting those that have been our friends for a long period of time. That just doesn’t make sense to me,” Australia’s Minister for Tourism and International Education and Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade Senator Richard Colbeck said in Dubai. Australia has close political and economic relations with many Arab Middle East states, including the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members.

The GCC, which is Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, froze all FTA negotiations in 2009. “We’re very, very keen to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the GCC countries … we think that’s a big opportunity for us,” he said, adding that Australia is “anxious to start negotiating.” Senator Colbeck’s agenda includes meeting with UAE Minister of Economy Sultan Bin Saeed Al Mansouri and Chief Executive and Executive Director of Dubai-sovereign wealth fund Investment Corporation of Dubai Mohammad Al Shaibani. He is also believed to be meeting with Qatar’s Ministry of Economy in Doha. Australia is keen on sealing an FTA with the GCC following similar agreements with China, Japan and South Korea in 2014. Australia’s government hopes an FTA will increase trade and investment, particularly in Australian infrastructure, agriculture and tourism projects. “It’s very important for our country that we do have a strong flow of investment from outside Australia. There isn’t enough capital within our country to do a lot of the development we need to do.” Senator Colbeck said. Senior negotiator Gulf countries are already major foreign investors in Australia. The UAE is Australia’s 15th largest trading partner and 10th biggest foreign investor, including in ports, airports and electricity networks. But while Australia may be pushing this week for GCC-FTA talks, its senior negotiator Trade Minister Andrew Robb, who spearheaded the agreements with China, Japan and South Korea, is missing from the delegation. Senator Colbeck dismissed suggestions the absence of Minister Robb, a senior minister compared to Senator Colbeck, is a sign that Australia is waning interest in GCC negotiations. Australia is also negotiating an FTA with India. “I’ve been appointed as the minister assisting Andrew [Robb] in those trade negotiations so I don’t necessarily see that it sends any particular signal at all. We have a minister here, we have 80-odd businesses and institutions with us. We’re very, very keen and I’ll be conducting those discussions and negotiations with all the vigour I can muster,” he said. Next week, an Australian delegation of 25 companies led by a Saudi-based official will visit Egypt as part of the trade campaign. Facbox: Australian Middle East trade won’t pivot to Iran Australia’s trade and investment priorities in the Middle East are unlikely to change following the lifting of sanctions against Iran earlier this month, a government minister told Gulf News Sunday. “I don’t think we forget our good friends ... We have very good relationships here. We know the business community. We have good relationships with government. I don’t think that in any sense there is any thought or value in forgetting those that have been our friends for a long period of time. That just doesn’t make sense to me,” Australia’s Minister for Tourism and International Education and Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade Senator Richard Colbeck said in Dubai. Australia has close political and economic relations with many Arab Middle East states, including the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members.

News article:
Dubai: Australia is putting trade relations with the Middle East in focus as the government tries to manage a widening budget deficit and a slowdown in its largest trading partner, China. This week, Australian Minister for Tourism and International Education, Senator Richard Colbeck, will visit Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE and Saudi Arabia to drum up interest in Australia’s health, education and tourism sectors. The visit, part of the country’s annual regional trade campaign, comes as Australia faces concerns a recession may be nearing, which could bring 24 years of consecutive economic growth to an end. After a decade long resource export boom, Australia’s economy is having to rebalance itself to weaker demand in China and falling commodity prices globally. Senator Colbeck, who is also Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade, told Gulf News in an interview in Dubai on Sunday that the slowdown in China is one reason Australia is looking to boost the presence of its services industry in the Middle East. On Sunday, Senator Colbeck oversaw the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between Australia and a Dubai governmental department, Dubai Exports, to facilitate trade for manufacturers, exports, traders and service providers. Generating new demand of its services sector would be of significant benefit to Australia’s economy. The services sector accounts for 70 per cent of the Australian economy and even more for employment, but contracted in the last quarter of 2015. The contraction came as the government said last month that the deficit in 2015-2016 will reach 37.4 billion Australian dollars (Dh96 billion), up from a previous forecast of A$35.1 billion. In fact, its deficit will widen every year on previous estimates to at least 2018-2019 when it’s now projected to reach A$14.2 billion, up from A$6.9 billion. But while Australia is looking for Middle East trade to boost its economy, that currently accounts for just A$16 billion in bilateral trade a year compared to $213 billion with China. Meanwhile, the Australian economy is now expected to grow by 2.5 per cent in 2015-2016, not 2.75 per cent as previously thought. For 2018-2019, it has been revised to 3 per cent, down from 3.5 per cent.

With the lifting of economic sanctions against Iran already in place, Tehran and Beijing have started to revive bilateral trade and economic ties, the Chinese newspaper Renmin Ribao (People's Daily) reported. The newspaper quoted Hua Liming, former Chinese Ambassador to Iran, the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands, as saying that Sino-Iranian economic and trade ties, which have suffered severe setbacks over the past 30-plus years, are set to enter a new phase in the coming years. "As the sanctions have been lifted, Iran's oil exports are back on track," Hua said, adding that the Iranian economy is most likely to benefit not only from oil exports to China, but also from Chinese investment and technology.

© Unknown Iran is the new China? That may be the case - from Tehran clinching a deal to buy 114 planes from Airbus to Iranian oil soon hitting Western markets. But the key question is actually how, at what pace, and with what partners Tehran plans to rejoin global markets.All the commotion, at the moment, predictably revolves around oil. Iran's Deputy Oil Minister for Commerce and International Affairs, Amir Hossein Zamaninia, said the new oil export target is an extra 500,000 barrels a day within a few months. Tehran may indeed boost production by 600,000 barrels a day in six months, and add up to 800,000 barrels a day in output before the end of 2016.Not even the sharper oil analysts really know what this will mean in terms of an all-out, open market-share battle between Iran and Saudi Arabia. What even some sections of Western corporate media are not buying anymore are Saudi diversionist tactics about their cheap oil strategy - which has been essentially designed to hurt Iran, and Russia.Over 1,000 lines of credit have been opened for banks, according to President Hassan Rouhani. Energy-hungry Europeans are predictably going nuts. Even with non-denial denials, the fact is Shell executives, for instance, are already in Tehran, talking about Iran's "energy potential" and solidifying their positioning as Iran's "prime partner" in energy. Meanwhile, Iran's oil tankers are already sailing under Lloyd's insurance.Into this frenzy steps in none other than the aspiring 'New Master of the Universe'; Chinese President Xi Jinping, currently on a ultra high-profile Middle East tour of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and, of course, Iran.Take the strategic cooperation agreement signed this Tuesday in Riyadh between Aramco and China's Sinopec. It may be worth no more than $1.5 billion, but there will be others in its wake; after all Saudi Arabia, on and off, remains the biggest supplier of crude oil to China.Yet the really crucial strategic partnership here is Beijing-Tehran.China has been Iran's biggest trade partner since 2010, as well as the top buyer of Iranian crude and non-petroleum products (ore, agriculture) even under UN, US and EU sanctions.And in a graphic demonstration for the entire world to see, Xi is the first head of state to visit Iran since nuclear-related sanctions were lifted this past weekend.All this leads to a long-term question: is Iran the new China, in terms of a capitalist development bonanza, and will Iran follow a Chinese-style, centrally controlled, development project from now on?What's certain is that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei stressed over and over again that the renewal of negotiations with the US touched only the nuclear issue. And he repeatedly warned about the cultural, political and security consequences of an economic opening that could eventually weaken the Islamic Republic.So forget about Iran as a US partner. That won't happen. In the West, the privileged partner will be the EU, especially concerning investment in energy and in the sprawling, young, educated, virtually "virgin" Iranian market. And then, there's Eurasia integration.Relations with Russia will remain solid - from the need to secure Iran's northern frontier to a counterbalance to the American encirclement (which remains in place). Tehran and Moscow still need to solve the status of the Caspian Sea. But both share serious strategic interests in the Caucasus-Caspian-Central Asia arc - from fighting Salafi-jihadism (whose ideological matrix is, who else, Saudi Arabia) to the most crucial categorical imperative; the drive by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) for a Central Asian security mechanism limiting all Washington's options.It certainly does not hurt that militarily Iran finally received Russia's S-300 missiles, and their political-military coordination is in full effect; see for instance those Russian cruise missiles launched from the Caspian last October against ISIS/ISIL/Daesh traversing Iranian airspace.The same applies to Afghanistan; Iran - and the SCO - will do what it takes to prevent Afghanistan from being a perennial jihadist platform.And in the 'Pipelineistan' domain, Iran's relations with Pakistan tend to stabilize; after all Islamabad badly needs the Iran-Pakistan (IP) pipeline, which will eventually become IPI (reaching India, with which Iran has excellent relations).And that brings us back once again to the ultimate confrontation; the vicious proxy war between Tehran and the (collapsing) House of Saud on multiple theaters, from "Syraq", Bahrain and Yemen to the oil market.Xi Jinping's Middle East trip cannot possibly work as a messianic cure. The strategic relationship that matters is Beijing-Tehran - from the energy sphere to Eurasia integration via One Belt, One Road. But Beijing also needs Saudi oil.Warrior prince Mohammed bin Sultan - who's actually running the show in Riyadh - is thinking of selling Aramco. Why not offer it to Beijing? But be prepared to be paid in yuan. And all the oil goes to China. Talk about a New Silk Road offer one can't refuse.

News article:
© Unknown Iran is the new China? That may be the case - from Tehran clinching a deal to buy 114 planes from Airbus to Iranian oil soon hitting Western markets. But the key question is actually how, at what pace, and with what partners Tehran plans to rejoin global markets.All the commotion, at the moment, predictably revolves around oil. Iran's Deputy Oil Minister for Commerce and International Affairs, Amir Hossein Zamaninia, said the new oil export target is an extra 500,000 barrels a day within a few months. Tehran may indeed boost production by 600,000 barrels a day in six months, and add up to 800,000 barrels a day in output before the end of 2016.Not even the sharper oil analysts really know what this will mean in terms of an all-out, open market-share battle between Iran and Saudi Arabia. What even some sections of Western corporate media are not buying anymore are Saudi diversionist tactics about their cheap oil strategy - which has been essentially designed to hurt Iran, and Russia.Over 1,000 lines of credit have been opened for banks, according to President Hassan Rouhani. Energy-hungry Europeans are predictably going nuts. Even with non-denial denials, the fact is Shell executives, for instance, are already in Tehran, talking about Iran's "energy potential" and solidifying their positioning as Iran's "prime partner" in energy. Meanwhile, Iran's oil tankers are already sailing under Lloyd's insurance.Into this frenzy steps in none other than the aspiring 'New Master of the Universe'; Chinese President Xi Jinping, currently on a ultra high-profile Middle East tour of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and, of course, Iran.Take the strategic cooperation agreement signed this Tuesday in Riyadh between Aramco and China's Sinopec. It may be worth no more than $1.5 billion, but there will be others in its wake; after all Saudi Arabia, on and off, remains the biggest supplier of crude oil to China.Yet the really crucial strategic partnership here is Beijing-Tehran.China has been Iran's biggest trade partner since 2010, as well as the top buyer of Iranian crude and non-petroleum products (ore, agriculture) even under UN, US and EU sanctions.And in a graphic demonstration for the entire world to see, Xi is the first head of state to visit Iran since nuclear-related sanctions were lifted this past weekend.All this leads to a long-term question: is Iran the new China, in terms of a capitalist development bonanza, and will Iran follow a Chinese-style, centrally controlled, development project from now on?What's certain is that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei stressed over and over again that the renewal of negotiations with the US touched only the nuclear issue. And he repeatedly warned about the cultural, political and security consequences of an economic opening that could eventually weaken the Islamic Republic.So forget about Iran as a US partner. That won't happen. In the West, the privileged partner will be the EU, especially concerning investment in energy and in the sprawling, young, educated, virtually "virgin" Iranian market. And then, there's Eurasia integration.Relations with Russia will remain solid - from the need to secure Iran's northern frontier to a counterbalance to the American encirclement (which remains in place). Tehran and Moscow still need to solve the status of the Caspian Sea. But both share serious strategic interests in the Caucasus-Caspian-Central Asia arc - from fighting Salafi-jihadism (whose ideological matrix is, who else, Saudi Arabia) to the most crucial categorical imperative; the drive by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) for a Central Asian security mechanism limiting all Washington's options.It certainly does not hurt that militarily Iran finally received Russia's S-300 missiles, and their political-military coordination is in full effect; see for instance those Russian cruise missiles launched from the Caspian last October against ISIS/ISIL/Daesh traversing Iranian airspace.The same applies to Afghanistan; Iran - and the SCO - will do what it takes to prevent Afghanistan from being a perennial jihadist platform.And in the 'Pipelineistan' domain, Iran's relations with Pakistan tend to stabilize; after all Islamabad badly needs the Iran-Pakistan (IP) pipeline, which will eventually become IPI (reaching India, with which Iran has excellent relations).And that brings us back once again to the ultimate confrontation; the vicious proxy war between Tehran and the (collapsing) House of Saud on multiple theaters, from "Syraq", Bahrain and Yemen to the oil market.Xi Jinping's Middle East trip cannot possibly work as a messianic cure. The strategic relationship that matters is Beijing-Tehran - from the energy sphere to Eurasia integration via One Belt, One Road. But Beijing also needs Saudi oil.Warrior prince Mohammed bin Sultan - who's actually running the show in Riyadh - is thinking of selling Aramco. Why not offer it to Beijing? But be prepared to be paid in yuan. And all the oil goes to China. Talk about a New Silk Road offer one can't refuse.
