News article:
Cairo: An Egyptian court on Sunday acquitted two police officers of torturing to death a lawyer while in detention three years ago in a case that triggered protests from his colleagues. The ruling was issued by the Cairo Criminal Court in a retrial of the two officers, legal sources said. The ruling can be appealed, they added. The case dates back to 2015 when Kareem Hamdi, a 27-year-old lawyer, had been arrested on suspicion of belonging to the banned Muslim Brotherhood and involvement in its violence. He later died inside a police station in the northern Cairo district of Matariya, a stronghold of Islamists. Lawyers accused police of torturing Hamdi to death allegedly to extract confessions from him. They staged anti-government protests. The country’s chief prosecutor ordered both officers from the National Security Agency to stand trial on charges of torturing the lawyer to death. In December 2015, a court sentenced the two to five years in prison each. In October 2016, the Court of Cassation, Egypt’s top appeals tribunal, revoked the verdict and ordered a retrial for both defendants. Egyptian authorities have pursued a relentless crackdown on Islamists since 2013 when the military toppled president Mohammad Mursi of the Brotherhood following massive protests against his rule. Rights groups have repeatedly accused the government of ignoring police’s purported violations. Authorities have downplayed the alleged abuses as isolated acts, vowing to bring any wrongdoer to justice. In recent years, several policemen have been handed down varying jail terms in separate torture cases in Egypt. Police abuses were seen as a major catalyst for the 2011 revolt that forced long-time president Hosni Mubarak out of power.

News article:
Muslim Brotherhood members have been placed on terror lists in Egypt. (Getty Images) Cairo - Asharq Al-Awsat A Cairo court in Egypt ordered on Saturday that 20 Muslim Brotherhood members be placed on terrorist lists for the next five years. The court based its decision on proof that the accused were terrorists because some of them were leaders of the Brotherhood. Others were accused of joining and funding the group to carry out terror attacks and promote its ideology. Egypt labels the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. Several charges have been laid against the 20 terror suspects, including purchasing weapons and arms. They also received some of their funds through Brotherhood leaderships abroad In a separate development, the Cairo Criminal Court set August 4 as the date for the retrial of seven defendants in the so-called Tanta terror cell case. The suspects are charged with forming a terror cell in the western city of Tanta for the purpose of attacking the army and police. In 2016, the suspects were originally given death or prison sentences. The northern Cairo criminal court then accepted the defendants’ appeal in 2017 and ordered a retrial.

News article:
An Egyptian court has acquitted two police officers of charges of torturing and murdering a prominent lawyer in 2015. Karim Hamdi was beaten to death at a Cairo police station in 2015 following a pro-democracy rally, with officials alleging he was part of the group. He died two days after his arrest sparking outrage amongst the country's lawyers. The two officers, a lieutenant colonel and captain with the national security service, were sentenced to five years in prison in December 2015, but yesterday successfully appealed the conviction. Yesterday, Egypt's prosecutor also referred some 278 terror suspects to a military court on charges of joining two breakaway Muslim Brotherhood factions. Since the ousting of Egypt's first democratically elected President Mohamed Morsi in 2013, the Muslim Brotherhood has been banned and designated a terror organisation by the government. Hundreds endure unfair trials, with many subsequently sentenced to death; some six people were awarded the death sentence last month for their participation in protests in 2013. Read: Egypt beefs up security outside metro stations after fare rise protests The news of the overturned conviction comes amid controversy over a leaked video released last week that appears to show a child being executed at close range in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula by an army officer, dating back to 2015. In February Amnesty International condemned the escalating "human rights crisis" in Egypt in its annual World Report, citing the country's endemic arbitrary arrests and detentions of hundreds, as well as the new legal restrictions imposed on NGOs and authorities turning a blind eye to torture. Egypt has repeatedly criticised the findings of many NGOs accusing them of being deliberately "misleading" on human rights abuses. In September, the Egyptian government pledged to take action against Human Rights Watch after it released a damning report on state torture. The Egyptian Human Rights Committee denied the allegations, claiming that no political prisoners had ever reported incidents of torture. The foreign ministry also accused the NGO of bias, alleging it received support from the Muslim Brotherhood. Two weeks later, President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi told US officials in New York that human rights should not be judged from a Western perspective, arguing that Egypt had taken numerous measures to ensure the economic and social wellbeing of its citizens.

News article:
Algiers - Asharq Al-Awsat Amnesty International has asked the Algerian authorities to release a blogger who faces the death penalty on “espionage charges.” In a post early last year, Merzoug Touati interviewed an Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson in which he disputes accusations by the Algerian authorities that the Israeli authorities were involved in protests in Algeria. The trial of Touati “on trumped-up espionage charges based on online posts is yet another stain on the country’s human rights record,” Amnesty International said on Wednesday on the eve of the opening hearing. Touati, 32, “faces charges relating to a Facebook post and YouTube video that authorities claim encouraged civil unrest. He has been in detention since January 2017,” it said. “Amnesty International has reviewed the court documents which list as 'evidence' the posts published by Touati before his Facebook account and website were deleted, and found that there was no incitement to violence or advocacy of hatred, rather his posts were covered by freedom of expression in relation to his work as a citizen-journalist,” according to the US-basked human rights organization. “Amnesty International therefore considers Merzoug Touati a prisoner of conscience held solely for expressing his peaceful opinions,” it said. Heba Morayef, Middle East and North Africa regional director at Amnesty International, said that every day “Touati spends in prison ... is a further stain on Algeria’s human rights record.” “It is ludicrous that a Facebook post expressing peaceful opinion could lead to the death penalty. Touati represents the broken dreams of a generation in a country where freedom of expression has been repeatedly undermined,” she added.

PARIS: Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan, detained in France over rape allegations by four women, has lost an appeal for early release ahead of his trial, the Paris appeals court said late on Tuesday. Judges had earlier this month refused bail for 55-year-old Ramadan, who is being treated behind bars for multiple sclerosis, as well as a request for release on health grounds. The Swiss citizen was not in court to hear Tuesday’s ruling as his defence argued that testimony from his accusers contained "contradictions". "There is no objective reason to keep Mr Tariq Ramadan in provisional custody," his lawyer Emmanuel Marsigny told AFP after failing to sway the court. He had proposed that Ramadan be held at home and surrender his passport. "The presumption of innocence is trampled underfoot," Marsigny added. The prominent TV pundit and Oxford University professor, whose grandfather founded Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood movement, has been held since February on charges that he raped two women in France. Two other women have since made rape claims against him. Prosecutors argued Ramadan should stay in detention over fears that he could potentially flee France and also to protect the women who made the allegations against him. While the investigation is under way, "it appears to the plaintiffs more desirable that Mr Ramadan be available to the court," said Francis Szpiner, a lawyer for two of Ramadan’s accusers. Many of Ramadan’s supporters -- including two million Facebook followers -- insist he has been unfairly targeted because he is Muslim, while Marsigny has slammed what he describes as "lies" and inconsistencies by Ramadan’s accusers. Ramadan’s first accuser, Henda Ayari, 41, is a feminist activist who previously practised a conservative strain of Islam. She says Ramadan raped her in a Paris hotel room in 2012. A second woman, who is disabled, claims that Ramadan raped and beat her in a hotel in the southeastern city of Lyon in 2009. The third accuser, a French Muslim woman who is using the pseudonym "Marie", came forward in early March and claims to have suffered multiple rapes in France, Brussels and London between 2013 and 2014. A fourth woman has filed rape charges in Geneva against Ramadan. Ramadan has denied wrongdoing and is suing one of his accusers, Ayari, for slander.

News article:
FILE - Mohammed Badie, Supreme Guide of Muslim Brotherhood group CAIRO – 27 May 2018: Cairo Criminal Court adjourned Monday the retrial of former Muslim Brotherhood group supreme guide, Mohamed Badie, and eight other MB members in the case known as “al-Bahr al-Azam” to July 29. In September 2014, the defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment over charges of “inciting clashes” in al-Bahr al-Azam district, Giza, causing the death of five people. However, the Court of Cassation overturned the verdicts on November 8, 2015. On April 14, Egypt Court of Cassation upheld a life imprisonment sentence (25 years) against Badie, over charges of inciting violence in the “Rabaa operation room case”. Badie along with other defendants were charged of orchestrating a plan to spread chaos and violence across Egypt following the dispersal of the 2013 Rabaa and Nahda sit-ins. On May 8, 2017, the Giza Criminal Court sentenced Badie and two other defendants to life imprisonment. Meanwhile, 15 other defendants were sentenced to five years in prison each, and 21 others were acquitted. Badie was found guilty in the trial of “cutting-off Qalyoub Road”, in which 36 defendants were also convicted in October 2016. He is still being tried in 11 known cases, mainly over charges of “inciting violence”. However, he stated in a hearing over charges of inciting violence in Minya that he is facing 48 trials, Masrawy reported on February 28. Badie was sentenced to life in prison in many other cases, including espionage for Hamas, as well as the guidance bureau and Istiqama mosque incidents; however, retrials were ordered in the cases. He was arrested on August 19, 2013, as part of a nation-wide crackdown on Brotherhood leaders in the wake of increasing violence and protests after two Brotherhood sit-ins were dispersed in 2013. The incidents caused the deaths of hundreds of policemen and supporters of the MB-affiliated former president Mohamed Morsi. Badie, 74, was the eighth leader of the banned Muslim Brotherhood (MB) organization. He became leader of the organization in 2010 after his predecessor Mahdi Akef, who died in 2017. On April 30, the Cairo Criminal Court has reordered placing the Muslim Brotherhood organization and 1,529 defendants, including Badie, and Morsi on the terror list.

News article:
An Algerian blogger who was jailed after interviewing an Israeli diplomat has appealed his 10-year sentence, his lawyer says, after global rights groups condemned the severity of the punishment. Merzoug Touati was convicted on Thursday of providing intelligence to “agents of a foreign power” likely to damage Algeria, by a court in Bejaia, east of Algiers. The 30-year-old blogger submitted his appeal the following day and was feeling “optimistic,” his lawyer Boubakeur Esseddik Hamaili says. “I have seen my client, he is doing well and is a tower of strength. He proclaims his innocence as he has done nothing but exercise his rights guaranteed by the constitution,” the lawyer adds. Touati has been in prison since his arrest in January 2017, over an online video interview with an Israeli foreign ministry spokesman and a Facebook post in which he called for protests against a new financial law. — AFP

 complementary.

The image shows Merzoug Touati, the Algerian blogger who was jailed after interviewing an Israeli diplomat. The image is a headshot of Touati, and he is looking directly at the camera. He has a slight smile on his face. The image is taken from a low angle, which makes Touati look up at the viewer. This angle makes Touati appear to be in a position of power, even though he is in prison. The image is cropped closely around Touati's face, which helps to focus the viewer's attention on him. The background of the image is blurred, which helps to make Touati stand out. The overall effect of the image is one of strength and determination.

The news events set is about Touati's arrest, trial, and imprisonment. The image is complementary to the news events set because it provides a visual representation of Touati. The image helps to humanize Touati and to make him more relatable to the reader. The image also helps to illustrate the story of Touati's arrest, trial, and imprisonment.

CAIRO, May 30 (Reuters) - Egypt’s state security prosecutor on Wednesday ordered four Egyptian officials detained for four days for questioning on suspicion of taking bribes from commodities trading firms, a judicial source said. State news agency MENA reported on Tuesday the officials had been arrested. They include the chairman of the state Food Industries Holding Company (FIHC), a supply ministry adviser responsible for coordination with parliament, a supply ministry spokesman and an official in the FIHC chairman’s office, MENA said. FIHC, a state buyer that has historically handled a broad sweep of commodities, tendering locally and internationally for staples like vegetable oils and sugar, has in recent years seen its role reduced in favour of state grain-buyer GASC. Egypt is the world’s largest importer of wheat and a major buyer of staples like corn and vegetable oils. (Reporting by Haitham Ahmed, writing by John Davison, editing by Larry King)

News article:
An Egyptian court has adjourned the trial of the Muslim Brotherhood's Supreme Guide until 4 July. Mohamed Badei and other members of the movement are charged with murder, attempted murder and inciting violence in incidents dating back to 2013. The case revolves around protests and clashes that erupted on 30 June, 2013 outside the Muslim Brotherhood's headquarters, the Guidance Bureau. Protesters were demanding the ouster of then-President Mohamed Morsi while Morsi's supporters insisted that he should remain in power until the end of his presidential term in 2016. The anti-Morsi protests were followed on 3 July by a military coup in which the democratically-elected President, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, was overthrown. Since Morsi's ouster, the Egyptian authorities have outlawed the movement as a "terrorist organisation" and launched an unprecedented crackdown on its members, supporters and sympathisers. The crackdown has spread to include democrats and human rights defenders among its victims. Numerous Brotherhood members have been arrested and prosecuted in cases that are described by observers and human rights groups as "political". The Egyptian government blames the Brotherhood for a wave of violence and militant insurgency that has gripped the country since the coup. The movement denies the accusations.

The news article is about the trial of the Muslim Brotherhood's Supreme Guide, Mohamed Badei, and other members of the movement. The image is complementary to the news article because it provides a visual representation of the people who are involved in the trial. The image also helps to illustrate the seriousness of the charges against the Muslim Brotherhood members, as they are accused of murder, attempted murder, and inciting violence.


News article:
An Egyptian court has adjourned the trial of the Muslim Brotherhood's Supreme Guide until 4 July. Mohamed Badei and other members of the movement are charged with murder, attempted murder and inciting violence in incidents dating back to 2013. The case revolves around protests and clashes that erupted on 30 June, 2013 outside the Muslim Brotherhood's headquarters, the Guidance Bureau. Protesters were demanding the ouster of then-President Mohamed Morsi while Morsi's supporters insisted that he should remain in power until the end of his presidential term in 2016. The anti-Morsi protests were followed on 3 July by a military coup in which the democratically-elected President, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, was overthrown. Since Morsi's ouster, the Egyptian authorities have outlawed the movement as a "terrorist organisation" and launched an unprecedented crackdown on its members, supporters and sympathisers. The crackdown has spread to include democrats and human rights defenders among its victims. Numerous Brotherhood members have been arrested and prosecuted in cases that are described by observers and human rights groups as "political". The Egyptian government blames the Brotherhood for a wave of violence and militant insurgency that has gripped the country since the coup. The movement denies the accusations.

Carmelo Zuccaro, the chief prosecutor of the Sicilian port city of Catania, looks on as he speaks before the Senate defense committee in Rome, Italy May 3, 2017. REUTERS/Remo Casilli CAIRO – 1 June 2018: An Italy-based Egyptian citizen has been acquitted of human trafficking charges that he was previously indicted on, according to Italian website AKI, citing Italian security sources on Thursday. The 27-year-old Egyptian citizen, whose name is Assa’ad Nassif Hajaj Mohamed Ghareb, was arrested in 2014 on charges of facilitating smuggling immigration to Italy. Ghareb’s indictment came as part of a broader investigation launched into an Italian-Egyptian smuggling group that used to smuggle to Italy hundreds of citizens coming from African and Middle Eastern countries, according to the report of AKI. The report added that Ghareeb is currently working and living normally in Italy. The Egyptian Parliament approved in October 2016 a new illegal-immigration and smuggling law, including tough penalties on whoever assists and facilitates the process of illegal immigration. The law was drafted by the Cabinet in 2015, and was sent in June 2016 to the Parliament for discussion. The Parliament’s efforts to approve the law came following the boat that capsized off the coast of Rashid in Beheira governorate while heading to Europe, killing dozens of people.

News article:
CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court sentenced on Thursday 28 defendants up to 15 years in prison over storming a police station following the removal of former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in 2013, official MENA news agency reported. Giza Criminal Court sentenced 18 defendants to 15 years in jail and 10 others to five years for breaking into a police station in Atfih district in Giza province near the capital Cairo. The defendants also faced charges of assaulting the police station chief and other policemen, as well as setting fire to 15 police vehicles, burning down 65 seized private cars and stealing police weapons. Morsi was removed by the military in early July 2013 in response to mass protests against his one-year rule. Later security crackdown on his supporters, mostly from the currently outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group, left hundreds dead and thousands arrested. Newly re-elected President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi led Morsi's ouster as the army chief then. A lot of Brotherhood leaders, members and supporters, including Morsi himself and the group's top chief Mohamed Badie, are currently jailed, and many have received appealable death sentences and life imprisonments over various charges varying from inciting violence and murder to espionage and jailbreak. Since Morsi's ouster, Egypt has been facing a wave of terror attacks that have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers, as well as civilians, with a Sinai-based militant group affiliated with the regional Islamic State terrorist group claiming responsibility for most of them. Meanwhile, the Egyptian forces have killed hundreds of terrorists and arrested thousands of suspects during the country's anti-terror war declared by Sisi following Morsi's removal.

News article:
BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Thursday it would “open its door wider” to German businesses, giving a warm reception to visiting Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has wooed Beijing to counterbalance trade threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. Germany and China, two exporting nations that run large trade surpluses with the United States, have found themselves in Trump’s firing line and are scrambling to preserve the multi-lateral order on which their prosperity rests. Merkel faces a delicate balancing act on the trip to show Chinese-German solidarity over trade and the Iran nuclear deal without harming ties with long-term ally Washington. In the latest U.S. trade move that has alarmed Beijing and Berlin alike, the Trump administration announced on Wednesday a national security investigation on into car and truck imports that could potentially lead to tariffs. The announcement hurt share prices of both European and Asian carmakers. China vowed to protect its interests. European countries are also concerned that their exporters could be hurt if China instructs importers to buy more U.S. goods to ease trade disputes with the Trump administration. China has already signaled to state companies to buy more U.S. oil and soybeans, trade sources told Reuters. Premier Li Keqiang, in a joint media appearance with Merkel at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, said China and Germany both upheld global free trade, and stressed the huge potential for cooperation between them. Though the two countries had problems, they could be overcome, Li said. “China’s door is open. You can say it will open even wider,” Li said. Trump’s “America First” trade policy, his administration’s professed disdain for the World Trade Organization, as well as his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, have pushed China and Germany into closer alignment, German officials say. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang review the guard of honour during a welcome ceremony outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Jason Lee However, Merkel’s government also shares many of the Trump administration’s concerns about Chinese business practices, including what many Western countries say are state-backed efforts to push foreign companies to give up trade secrets. In Copenhagen, the chief executive of Maersk MAERSKb.CO, the world's biggest container shipper, said China was "becoming more and more assertive about its own agenda – a China that uses its competition laws for own benefit" in the shipping sector. “We look with concern at the growing protectionist rhetoric around the world,” Soren Skou said. “The EU will be the decisive driving force in free trade, not the least at a time when it seems the United States doesn’t want to take the lead.” “STRIDING FORWARD” Li said Beijing would protect the interests of German firms investing in China and adjust its rules if needed: “If they come across any problems during their investment, especially when it comes to legal protections, I can clearly tell you that China is striding forward to being a country with rule of law.” German companies have complained for years about barriers to the Chinese market and intellectual property theft. Merkel welcomed China’s recent announcements that it would further open its financial sector to foreign participation and reduce Chinese joint venture requirements in sectors such as automobiles. But German industry said it was now up to China to deliver on its promises of greater openness. “China must rigorously reduce the asymmetries in market access,” said Hubert Lienhard, head of the Asia Pacific Committee of German Industry (APA). Trump has also driven Europe to work more closely with China by pulling out of a 2015 deal to lift sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear program. European countries, Russia and China, all parties to the deal, are searching for a way to salvage it by continuing to offer economic benefits to Iran in return for its compliance, despite U.S. sanctions. Merkel, who personally lobbied Trump not to pull out of the pact but was rebuffed, said Germany and China were “united in the view that we do not want to put this agreement in doubt”. In a nod to China, Merkel said that if U.S. sanctions force European companies to reduce business with Iran, “this creates the possibility for others to then get more into Iran.”

News article:
German Chancellor Merkel has stressed that improved ties with China are a much-needed step toward solving international crises. Merkel's delegation is also seeking greater market access for German companies in China. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday that close cooperation between the two countries was essential to solving the world's crises. Merkel's trip to China comes amid rising tensions in both Beijing and the European Union over trade relations with the United States, as well as US President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. Merkel said both Berlin and Beijing would stand behind the existing 2015 deal that saw Tehran give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for sanctions being lifted on Iran. While admitting that the Iran deal is not perfect, Merkel added that the alternatives are even more uncertain. She also said the imposition of US sanctions could force some European countries away from business with Iran.

Merkel said she hoped for denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and that she had seen "very hopeful things recently." The chancellor told Li during their meeting at Beijing's Great Hall that there was scope for closer cooperation between Germany and China and that the two sides should hold regular bilateral meetings, not just on business and trade, but also on human rights. "Then our conversations can center on really where there are still problems, what the solutions are and what the opportunities are," Merkel said. "Then we can play our part in a global, multilateral system." Addressing the human rights situation in China, Li said the country's constitution respects human rights and added that he hoped China and Germany could discuss rights issues on a case-by-case basis. He did not mention Liu Xia, the widow of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, who has been under house arrest since 2010 without being charged with a crime. The chancellor also stressed her continued commitment to the trans-Atlantic partnership with the United States, despite facing increased tensions and less common ground with Washington. Both Berlin and Beijing have decried Trump's decision to walk away from the Iranian nuclear accord, while both also face being slapped with punitive trade tariffs by Trump administration. The chancellor is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later on Thursday for further talks. Merkel vying for greater Chinese market access On Friday, Merkel is slated to travel to China's technology hub of Shenzhen with a German business delegation. German business leaders and lawmakers have long protested the uneven playing field. Some businesses have said they feel they are being squeezed out as China's workforce reaches a higher level of expertise, albeit without always playing by international rules or respecting international copyright and patent laws.

Those complaints have grown more vocal in recent years, particularly as China's investment into Europe has jumped from €700 million ($819 million) in 2008 to €35 billion just eight years later. However, Merkel also lauded China for its fast-paced economic growth and its technological development during talks with Li.

Darius Shahtahmasebi is a New Zealand-based legal and political analyst who focuses on US foreign policy in the Middle East, Asia and Pacific region. He is fully qualified as a lawyer in two international jurisdictions. Germany has had enough of American foreign policy. Angela Merkel’s visits to Russia and China are a testament to that. On May 10, 2018, German Chancellor Angela Merkel openly said that Europe can no longer count on the United States to protect it, hinting that the European continent would begin to “take destiny into its own hands.” The comments were, of course, a direct reference to US President Donald Trump’s ludicrous but anticipated decision to completely nuke the Iranian nuclear accord, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). “It is no longer such that the United States simply protects us, but Europe must take its destiny in its own hands. That's the task of the future," Merkel reportedly said during a speech honoring French President Emmanuel Macron. Eerily enough, approximately a year ago, Merkel offered almost the exact same sentiments, stating that Europe “really must take our fate into our own hands.” In the weeks since, Merkel has certainly proved that this was no idle threat. The German chancellor has made trips to both Russia and China, and the outcomes of those meetings appear to suggest a complete restructuring of the balance of power in Europe and Asia respectively. China and Germany see eye to eye Just this Thursday, China has already said it would “open its door wider” to German businesses after giving Merkel a warm reception. Both China and Germany have a common interest in defeating Trump’s plan to kill trade surpluses that countries have with the United States, as they are both equally affected by Trump’s threats. Each time Trump opens his mouth, it seems that European and Asian businesses are instantly affected. Germany is the largest auto exporter to the US out of any European country, and is China’s biggest European trading partner which was worth $179 billion just last year alone. Both Merkel and Macron tried their hand at persuading the Trump administration not to abandon the Iranian nuclear deal completely. The leaders even issued a joint statement with British Prime Minister Theresa May, someone whose hawkish attitude towards Iran should not go unnoticed. Not surprisingly, according to Reuters, German officials have said that “Trump’s America First’ trade policy, his administration’s professed disdain for the World Trade Organization, as well as his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, have pushed China and Germany into closer alignment.” It is not clear if the Trump administration is that incompetent or if this is done on purpose, in full knowledge that its actions will only further isolate the United States on the world stage and push states that previously held more adversarial positions closer and closer together. If it is done on purpose, one has to wonder what sort of mindset is behind the leadership which is on a self-destruct mission, and how it expects to maintain its worldwide empire, all the while irking its traditional allies. It is quite clear that Trump’s decision to axe the Iran deal will only pave the way for China to take advantage of the financial opportunities flowing out of Iran if sanctions present a buffer to German interests. China has already been assisting Iran to out-maneuver US-led sanctions through, for example, the use of credit lines using the Yuan. In that context, does Donald Trump want to contain China or empower it? You can only go so far serving the interests of Saudi Arabia and Israel while ignoring strong European states who would rather ink financial deals than turn Iran into a glass crater, a strong point of difference between Merkel and say, newly appointed US national security adviser John Bolton. The lifting of sanctions on Iran already led to an increase in trade between Germany and Iran from €2.7 billion in 2014 to €3.5 billion last year. It is also worth noting that Iran will now start accepting euros for its oil in an attempt to not only avoid the US dollar, but in a move that will directly threaten it. This topic is probably best suited for another article, but it is definitely something worth keeping an eye on – and will most likely only bolster Germany’s resolve to protect Iran. Either way, Germany and China have both agreed to stick to the Iran deal. Think for a second what this means: John Bolton openly warned European companies and countries against continuing business with Iran, stating that they could be targeted by sanctions. The newly appointed ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, also immediately warned Germany directly that German companies must halt their business activities with Tehran or face sanctions. The German-Chinese announcement also came just after Iran’s leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, issued a set of demands of its own, stating that the Europeans also could not be trusted. Germany and China have essentially given the US the political middle finger in response, and arguably kowtowed to Iranian interests instead. German-Russian relations to continue Not too long ago, the US also warned Germany that sanctions may also target the German-Russia pipeline known as the Nord Stream 2 Project. If you ever needed proof that the underlying reasons for US-led wars were driven by money and natural gas, this is it. Why prevent Germany and Russia from working on this monumental project? Germany needs the gas, and Russia, relatively close-by, can supply it. Despite the fact that the two countries continue to hold a number of disputes (including sanctions that continue to target Russia), Merkel’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin demonstrates that it is still possible to meet with one’s counterpart and discuss those issues amicably, an idea that seems almost completely lost on the current Trump administration. “If you want to solve problems, you have to talk to each other,” Merkel said alongside Putin midway through the talks. One Russian presidential aide reportedly suggested that the meeting went ahead because the two world leaders now found themselves on the same page, stating that “when opinions coincide, then countries at the very least become a bit closer to one another.” According to a senior German official with knowledge of the chancellery’s strategy, rapprochement with Russia is now a core policy objective in Berlin. Polls are already suggesting that Germans trust Russia under Putin more than they trust the United States under Trump. That is some amazing 4D chess President Trump is playing.

Darius Shahtahmasebi is a New Zealand-based legal and political analyst who focuses on US foreign policy in the Middle East, Asia and Pacific region. He is fully qualified as a lawyer in two international jurisdictions. Germany has had enough of American foreign policy. Angela Merkel’s visits to Russia and China are a testament to that. On May 10, 2018, German Chancellor Angela Merkel openly said that Europe can no longer count on the United States to protect it, hinting that the European continent would begin to “take destiny into its own hands.” The comments were, of course, a direct reference to US President Donald Trump’s ludicrous but anticipated decision to completely nuke the Iranian nuclear accord, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). “It is no longer such that the United States simply protects us, but Europe must take its destiny in its own hands. That's the task of the future," Merkel reportedly said during a speech honoring French President Emmanuel Macron. Eerily enough, approximately a year ago, Merkel offered almost the exact same sentiments, stating that Europe “really must take our fate into our own hands.” In the weeks since, Merkel has certainly proved that this was no idle threat. The German chancellor has made trips to both Russia and China, and the outcomes of those meetings appear to suggest a complete restructuring of the balance of power in Europe and Asia respectively. China and Germany see eye to eye Just this Thursday, China has already said it would “open its door wider” to German businesses after giving Merkel a warm reception. Both China and Germany have a common interest in defeating Trump’s plan to kill trade surpluses that countries have with the United States, as they are both equally affected by Trump’s threats. Each time Trump opens his mouth, it seems that European and Asian businesses are instantly affected. Germany is the largest auto exporter to the US out of any European country, and is China’s biggest European trading partner which was worth $179 billion just last year alone. Both Merkel and Macron tried their hand at persuading the Trump administration not to abandon the Iranian nuclear deal completely. The leaders even issued a joint statement with British Prime Minister Theresa May, someone whose hawkish attitude towards Iran should not go unnoticed. Not surprisingly, according to Reuters, German officials have said that “Trump’s America First’ trade policy, his administration’s professed disdain for the World Trade Organization, as well as his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, have pushed China and Germany into closer alignment.” It is not clear if the Trump administration is that incompetent or if this is done on purpose, in full knowledge that its actions will only further isolate the United States on the world stage and push states that previously held more adversarial positions closer and closer together. If it is done on purpose, one has to wonder what sort of mindset is behind the leadership which is on a self-destruct mission, and how it expects to maintain its worldwide empire, all the while irking its traditional allies. It is quite clear that Trump’s decision to axe the Iran deal will only pave the way for China to take advantage of the financial opportunities flowing out of Iran if sanctions present a buffer to German interests. China has already been assisting Iran to out-maneuver US-led sanctions through, for example, the use of credit lines using the Yuan. In that context, does Donald Trump want to contain China or empower it? You can only go so far serving the interests of Saudi Arabia and Israel while ignoring strong European states who would rather ink financial deals than turn Iran into a glass crater, a strong point of difference between Merkel and say, newly appointed US national security adviser John Bolton. The lifting of sanctions on Iran already led to an increase in trade between Germany and Iran from €2.7 billion in 2014 to €3.5 billion last year. It is also worth noting that Iran will now start accepting euros for its oil in an attempt to not only avoid the US dollar, but in a move that will directly threaten it. This topic is probably best suited for another article, but it is definitely something worth keeping an eye on – and will most likely only bolster Germany’s resolve to protect Iran. Either way, Germany and China have both agreed to stick to the Iran deal. Think for a second what this means: John Bolton openly warned European companies and countries against continuing business with Iran, stating that they could be targeted by sanctions. The newly appointed ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, also immediately warned Germany directly that German companies must halt their business activities with Tehran or face sanctions. The German-Chinese announcement also came just after Iran’s leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, issued a set of demands of its own, stating that the Europeans also could not be trusted. Germany and China have essentially given the US the political middle finger in response, and arguably kowtowed to Iranian interests instead. German-Russian relations to continue Not too long ago, the US also warned Germany that sanctions may also target the German-Russia pipeline known as the Nord Stream 2 Project. If you ever needed proof that the underlying reasons for US-led wars were driven by money and natural gas, this is it. Why prevent Germany and Russia from working on this monumental project? Germany needs the gas, and Russia, relatively close-by, can supply it. Despite the fact that the two countries continue to hold a number of disputes (including sanctions that continue to target Russia), Merkel’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin demonstrates that it is still possible to meet with one’s counterpart and discuss those issues amicably, an idea that seems almost completely lost on the current Trump administration. “If you want to solve problems, you have to talk to each other,” Merkel said alongside Putin midway through the talks. One Russian presidential aide reportedly suggested that the meeting went ahead because the two world leaders now found themselves on the same page, stating that “when opinions coincide, then countries at the very least become a bit closer to one another.” According to a senior German official with knowledge of the chancellery’s strategy, rapprochement with Russia is now a core policy objective in Berlin.

News article:
The billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros warned Europe that President Donald Trump has effectively destroyed its transatlantic alliance with America, and that the continent faces an "existential crisis" because of its current turmoil. Soros, 87, a Holocaust survivor from Budapest, Hungary, made the remarks in a speech on Tuesday at the European Council on Foreign Relations. He was speaking on the subject of saving the European Union from collapse. It was Trump's decision to withdraw America from the Iran nuclear deal, despite pleas from Britain, France and Germany to stick with it, that left the U.S.-Europe alliance in tatters, Soros suggested. The Iran deal's future and efficacy is now in serious doubt. "In recent weeks not just Europe but the whole world has been shocked by President Trump's actions," said Soros, whose Open Society Foundation funds pro-democracy groups across the world. "He has unilaterally withdrawn from a nuclear arms treaty with Iran thereby effectively destroying the transatlantic alliance. This development will put additional pressure of unpredictable force on an already beleaguered Europe. It is no longer a figure of speech to say that Europe is in existential danger; it is the harsh reality," said Soros. Trump's "America First" rhetoric has sparked European policymakers to reconsider the continent's relationship with the U.S., on which it has relied for decades. Trump once called NATO "obsolete." After the Second World War, and throughout the Cold War period, America was a staunch ally of non-communist Europe and a guarantor of its security against the Soviet threat, primarily through NATO. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, NATO has expanded to incorporate former Soviet states, and America maintained its role despite the end of the Cold War. But Trump has made clear that he wants NATO to be less reliant on American leadership and resources, and is urging European member states to increase their own military spending. Though still strong allies, the extent to which Europe can rely on America's unwavering support is clouded by uncertainty. The solidity of the relationship's foundation was tested by Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, which was only signed in 2015, and underlined to Europe that America's reliability is not what it once was. Turning to Europe more generally, Soros had a stark warning for the future of the European Union, which he said is in a battle to save itself amid the rising influence of populism and euroskepticism, such as in Italy, Hungary and Poland. "The European Union is in an existential crisis. Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong," Soros said, pinning the start of its downturn in fortunes on the 2008 financial crisis. "​Europe faces three pressing problems: The refugee crisis; territorial disintegrations as exemplified by Brexit; and the austerity policy that has hindered Europe's economic development," Soros said, adding that "an existential crisis is no longer a figure of speech but the harsh reality. Europe needs to do something drastic to escape it. It needs to reinvent itself." The refugee crisis is "exploited," Soros said, by "unscrupulous leaders" such as the far-right President Viktor Orban in his own native Hungary. Orban, who ran an anti-Semitic election campaign which held Soros up as a hate figure, is "posing as the defender of his version of a Christian Europe that is challenging the values on which the European Union was founded. He is trying to take over the leadership of the Christian Democratic parties, which form the majority in the European Parliament," Soros said. To overcome the likes of Orban and put the European Union back on solid ground, Soros said it must ditch its commitment to "ever-closer union" and instead "allow member states a wider variety of choices." "This would have a far-reaching beneficial effect. Right now, attitudes towards cooperation are negative: Member states want to reassert their sovereignty rather than surrender more of it," he said. "But if cooperation produced positive results, attitudes may improve and some objectives, like defense, that are currently best pursued by coalitions of the willing may qualify for universal participation. "Harsh reality may force member states to set aside their national interests in the interest of preserving the European Union," said Soros.

After the Whistler meeting, the attending finance officials agreed on the need to take “decisive action” on the tariffs issue at the upcoming G7 summit in Charlevoix, Quebec. Speaking at a separate news conference, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that President Trump is trying to “rebalance our trade relationships.” He added that he had informed Trump about some of the comments made by America’s main trade partners and that the president would discuss these issues with his fellow G7 leaders. EU Reforms German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told reporters that the conflict over US over steel and aluminum tariffs encourage EU countries’ desire to speed up reforms in the bloc. "There were several issues discussed at the G7 over which there was no agreement. That's really quite unusual in the history of the G7," Scholz said. The EU ministers also voiced their concern about the effect the new US sanctions against Iran may have on European firms working in the Islamic Republic. “Total Incomprehension” Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said he told Mnuchin it was "our absolute view that this is absurd, that Canada could in any way be a security risk." "We're concerned that these actions are actually not conducive to helping our economy, they actually are destructive, and that is consistently held across the six countries that expressed their point of view to Secretary Mnuchin," Morneau added. Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso criticized Washington’s decision as "deeply deplorable," adding that it was the "US against everyone else." His opinion was echoed by French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire who said that Mnuchin was alone on the tariff issue, with the group becoming a "G6 plus one" as the other six G7 members had expressed "total incomprehension" over Washington’s move. READ MORE: Canada Files WTO, NAFTA Litigation to Counter US 'Illegal' Tariffs Trade frictions between the United States and the EU have heightened since Washington imposed a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports in March. The US move has also invited strong criticism from China which retaliated by imposing its own tariffs on imported US goods.

After the Whistler meeting, the attending finance officials agreed on the need to take “decisive action” on the tariffs issue at the upcoming G7 summit in Charlevoix, Quebec. Speaking at a separate news conference, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that President Trump is trying to “rebalance our trade relationships.” He added that he had informed Trump about some of the comments made by America’s main trade partners and that the president would discuss these issues with his fellow G7 leaders. EU Reforms German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told reporters that the conflict over US over steel and aluminum tariffs encourage EU countries’ desire to speed up reforms in the bloc. "There were several issues discussed at the G7 over which there was no agreement. That's really quite unusual in the history of the G7," Scholz said. The EU ministers also voiced their concern about the effect the new US sanctions against Iran may have on European firms working in the Islamic Republic. “Total Incomprehension” Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said he told Mnuchin it was "our absolute view that this is absurd, that Canada could in any way be a security risk." "We're concerned that these actions are actually not conducive to helping our economy, they actually are destructive, and that is consistently held across the six countries that expressed their point of view to Secretary Mnuchin," Morneau added. Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso criticized Washington’s decision as "deeply deplorable," adding that it was the "US against everyone else." His opinion was echoed by French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire who said that Mnuchin was alone on the tariff issue, with the group becoming a "G6 plus one" as the other six G7 members had expressed "total incomprehension" over Washington’s move. READ MORE: Canada Files WTO, NAFTA Litigation to Counter US 'Illegal' Tariffs Trade frictions between the United States and the EU have heightened since Washington imposed a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports in March. The US move has also invited strong criticism from China which retaliated by imposing its own tariffs on imported US goods.

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 complementary.

The image shows the flags of the G7 nations, which is the group of countries that the news article is about. The image is taken from a high angle, which makes the flags look small and insignificant. This could be seen as a reflection of the fact that the G7 is no longer as powerful as it once was. The image is also taken from a distance, which makes it difficult to see the people who are standing behind the flags. This could be seen as a reflection of the fact that the G7 is not as transparent as it should be.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has shown a similar readiness to reconnect with Moscow. During their recent meeting in Moscow Merkel and Putin underscored the mutual importance of going ahead with the Nord Stream 2 project.

There are factors that are prodding both sides towards this. The mere fact that [French President Emmanuel] Macron and Merkel visited Moscow is a very positive sign because it had been a long time since either of them had been here.

News article:
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany has asked the U.S. government to clarify remarks by President Donald Trump’s new ambassador to Berlin after he told a right-wing website he wanted to empower “other conservatives” in Europe. Slideshow ( 2 images ) The comments by Richard Grenell, a former U.S. spokesman at the United Nations and an outspoken defender of Trump, drew criticism from politicians across the German political spectrum, warning him not to meddle in domestic politics. “We have asked the U.S. side for clarification, and whether (the remarks) were made as reported,” a foreign ministry spokesman said. The issue would be looked at again on Wednesday when Grenell is due to make his first official call at the ministry, the spokesman said. The political appointee caused anger on his first day in Berlin with a tweet telling German companies to wind down their business from Iran after the U.S. withdrew from a non-proliferation deal with Iran. In a further breach of protocol, Grenell also invited Austria’s Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, a critic of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s refugee policies, to an embassy lunch during his June 12 visit to Berlin, Spiegel magazine reported. Peter Launsky-Tieffenthal, spokesman for the Austrian government, dismissed criticism of the meeting with Kurz. “It is important, especially at times like these, to maintain contact with the closest associates of the U.S. president, especially on issues such as trade and transatlantic relations,” he said. In an interview with Breitbart News at the weekend, Grenell attributed the groundswell of conservatives across Europe to the “failed policies of the left”, adding: “I absolutely want to empower other conservatives throughout Europe, other leaders.” In the same interview, he described himself as a big fan of Kurz, the head of the conservative People’s Party and who shares power with the far-right Freedom Party in Vienna. An embassy spokesman said Kurz had requested the meeting. Merkel declined to comment on Kurz’s planned visit to the U.S. embassy during his visit to Berlin. “Like many others, I have taken note of this,” she said in a cool remark at a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu said that he had also had a brief meeting with Grenell during his Berlin visit. “I was asked by the American ambassador to meet him at the airport,” he said. “I wouldn’t draw any great meaning into that.” Rolf Muetzenich, deputy leader of the Social Democrats in parliament, said Grenell’s remarks should be raised quickly with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. “Clearly the U.S. ambassador sees himself as an extension of a right-wing conservative world movement,” he told Reuters. Muetzenich added that Grenell’s actions violated the 1961 Vienna Convention, under which diplomats do not interfere in the domestic affairs of a country. Grenell, like Trump an avid Twitter user, defended himself. “I stand by my comments that we are experiencing an awakening from the silent majority - those who reject the elites & their bubble. Led by Trump.” Not all German politicians have been hostile. Jens Spahn, perhaps the most prominent critic of Merkel within her Christian Democratic Union party, has been photographed repeatedly with the new ambassador since he arrived in Berlin.

The image shows a group of men in suits walking down a sidewalk. The men are all wearing serious expressions, and they appear to be engaged in a conversation. The image is taken from a distance, and it is not possible to identify the men. However, the image is likely of a group of politicians or diplomats. The news events set is about a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. President Donald Trump. The meeting was held in Berlin, and it was the first time that the two leaders had met since Trump took office. The meeting was widely seen as an opportunity for the two leaders to discuss a range of issues, including trade, security, and climate change. The image is aligned with the news events set because it shows a group of men who appear to be engaged in a serious discussion. The image is also taken from a distance, which suggests that the men are not aware that they are being photographed. This suggests that the image is not staged, and that it is a genuine capture of a moment in time.

News article:
The Angela Merkel that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet with on Monday is not the same Angela Merkel he worked with when she first took office nine years ago. Germany’s chancellor no longer holds the reins of power in Europe. Although the Christian Democratic Union of Germany party won the last elections, it took Merkel six months to form a new government—a precedent indicative of the growing threat to the political establishment in the country. While Merkel ultimately formed a government with the rival Social Democratic Party, one cannot be sure internal tensions will allow the government to continue for very long. The face of Europe has also changed dramatically in the past two years. Many believe it is now French President Emmanuel Macron, and not Merkel, who sets the tone for the European Union. Macron aspires to introduce reforms to the E.U. that would strengthen its federal character, in particular as concerns its financial management, at the expense of the sovereignty of member states. Merkel has become the main force obstructing these reforms. The rise of the populist right, which opposes the idea of a “United States of Europe,” and supports in principle, a Europe of nation-states instead, seems to have made it clear to Merkel that if she hopes to prevent the break-up of the E.U. and the weakening of Germany’s senior status, the E.U. must navigate a new course. There is growing anti-German sentiment in France, Italy, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Even Austria is grumbling over Berlin’s seemingly authoritative role. In Germany itself, the third-largest party in the Bundestag opposes the E.U. Many of its supporters feel disappointed by Merkel, especially since she let 2 million “refugees” into Germany. Italy’s vague political future could prove significant for the E.U. in a year in which Britain is set to voluntarily leave the union. Add to that growing tension between Brussels, and Eastern and Central European states, pressure on the E.U. to accept Balkan states as members, conflicts with the E.U.’s greatest ally, the United States, and, of course, the ever-present Russian threat. A significant portion of talks Netanyahu will hold in Berlin, Paris and London will obviously center on convincing the E.U. to obligate Iran to agree to vital additions to the nuclear deal, and significantly reduce its subversive activities in the Middle East and in particular on Israel’s borders. Although there are those in the European Union who have challenged the E.U. line that holds the union must remain in the accord, countries who are set to gain financially from the deal, like France, Germany, Italy and Austria, will continue to insist the E.U. honor its commitments, i.e. business deals and investments, towards Tehran. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories One cannot ignore the fact that, in light of Iranian provocations in Syria and Palestinian provocations in the Gaza Strip, the new German government has expressed full support for Israel’s unconditional right to protect its citizens, borders and territory. This support is a stark contrast from the weak language of the E.U. Commission. This refreshing change comes not just from Merkel’s office, from which a number of officials with problematic views on Israel have recently departed, but as a result of a generational shift led by the Christian Democrats’ social democratic partner. The older generation, which had an uncontrollable urge to preach morality to Israel, was sent home. The new leadership is too busy grappling with the serious problems facing Germany and the party to worry about bringing about a new world order. Israel should begin to engage in polite discussions with this German government over the problematic nature of Germany’s involvement in Israel’s internal affairs and funding of Palestinian organizations that do nothing to promote peace. Eldad Beck is an Israeli journalist and author.

The image shows German Chancellor Angela Merkel meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The news article is about the upcoming meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The article discusses the various challenges facing the European Union, including the rise of populism, the refugee crisis, and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The image is relevant to the news article because it shows Merkel meeting with a foreign leader to discuss important issues facing the European Union.


News article:
The Angela Merkel that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet with on Monday is not the same Angela Merkel he worked with when she first took office nine years ago. Germany’s chancellor no longer holds the reins of power in Europe. Although the Christian Democratic Union of Germany party won the last elections, it took Merkel six months to form a new government—a precedent indicative of the growing threat to the political establishment in the country. While Merkel ultimately formed a government with the rival Social Democratic Party, one cannot be sure internal tensions will allow the government to continue for very long. The face of Europe has also changed dramatically in the past two years. Many believe it is now French President Emmanuel Macron, and not Merkel, who sets the tone for the European Union. Macron aspires to introduce reforms to the E.U. that would strengthen its federal character, in particular as concerns its financial management, at the expense of the sovereignty of member states. Merkel has become the main force obstructing these reforms. The rise of the populist right, which opposes the idea of a “United States of Europe,” and supports in principle, a Europe of nation-states instead, seems to have made it clear to Merkel that if she hopes to prevent the break-up of the E.U. and the weakening of Germany’s senior status, the E.U. must navigate a new course.

News article:
OTTAWA, WASHINGTON Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this week plays host to a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations with six of the seven members outraged at the United States over a slew of recent moves by President Donald Trump. This year’s meeting is likely to be overshadowed by Trump’s planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, tentatively scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, where Pyongyang’s nuclear program is expected to be discussed. Trudeau, who wants the June 8-9 meeting to focus on economic growth, insists he can handle the challenge, though insiders and analysts say he will have to fight to keep the grouping together at a time when Trump’s trade and diplomatic moves have isolated the United States and risk undermining the G7’s relevance. “What this G7 is going to show is that the United States are alone against everyone and especially alone against their allies,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters on Friday before a meeting of his counterparts in British Columbia. Trump’s disdain for diplomatic niceties and his “America first” policies have created a rift with countries whose alliance with the United States dates to the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Trump has infuriated Canada and European Union members of the G7 by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminium and pulling out of a deal to monitor Iran’s nuclear activities. Japan fears being sidelined in its own back yard as Washington seeks to improve ties with North Korea. The three-day G7 finance ministers’ meeting, where the closest US allies vented anger over the Trump administration’s metal import tariffs, wrapped up on Saturday with a stern rebuke of Washington. ‘More open rupture’ Trudeau played down the talk of divisions at the summit, in the Quebec town of La Malbaie. “These questions get asked every time,” Trudeau told Reuters in a May 24 interview. He said the G7 was “extraordinarily valuable because it’s an opportunity for like-minded nations to come together and talk about shared challenges.” A spokesman for Trudeau said the prime minister’s position had not changed despite the tariffs. University of Ottawa international affairs professor Roland Paris, who served as Trudeau’s first foreign policy adviser, has a less upbeat view. “The primary challenge for this summit is to maintain the integrity of the G7 itself,” he said. While the most likely scenario was that the leaders gloss over their differences, he added, “there is the real possibility of a more open rupture.” Heather Conley, a former US State Department official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the divisions on trade meant it would be hard for leaders to focus on the other issues. “They’re either going to struggle through this and remain relevant to the management of the international system as it continues to evolve — or they’re not,” she said. Trudeau and the European Union condemned the steel and aluminium tariffs, and tempers will no doubt be high on June 8 when leaders hold a traditional discussion about trade. “Obviously it has the potential to be much more robust this year,” said a senior Canadian government official, who conceded this year’s meeting would be charged. “Is it more challenging this time than before? Yes, but everyone is showing up,” said the official, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. At the G7, Trump will defend his insistence on “fair and reciprocal trade,” said a White House National Security Council official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow described the tensions over trade as a family quarrel. “This thing can work out. I’m the optimist,” he told reporters on Friday.

News article:
Richard Allen Grenell has sparked uproar just weeks into his posting as US ambassador to Berlin A member of the German government on Tuesday accused the new US ambassador in Berlin of meddling in domestic politics and aggravating already tense ties, as left-wing parties called for the staunch ally of Donald Trump to be expelled. Richard Grenell took up his Berlin posting on May 8 and immediately irked Germany when he tweeted the same day that German companies should stop doing business with Iran as Trump quit the nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic. He stoked further outrage last weekend with reported comments to right-wing news website Breitbart of his ambition to "empower other conservatives throughout Europe, other leaders." Grenell also raised eyebrows with his plan to host a June 13 lunch for Austria's arch-conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, described by the US envoy as a "rock star." The ambassador "is interfering in our internal affairs," said Peter Beyer, coordinator for transatlantic cooperation in Angela Merkel's government, in an interview with regional newspaper the Rheinische Post. "He should pay attention to the fact that we consider his start as ambassador to be difficult," added the conservative politician, who will be present on Wednesday for a visit by the diplomat to the foreign ministry. Former chief of the Social Democratic Party and ex-European Parliament president Martin Schulz told national news agency DPA: "What this man is doing is unheard of in international diplomacy. "If a German ambassador were to say in Washington that he is there to empower the Democrats, he would have been kicked out immediately. "I hope that Kurz's visit will lead Mr Grenell's tenure as ambassador in Germany to be short," added Schulz, playing on the German word for short -- "kurz." Schulz had earlier tweeted that the US envoy did not behave like a diplomat but rather like a "far-right colonial officer." Amid the row, Germany's foreign ministry is seeking clarification from Grenell about his comments, with the topic to be raised at a pre-arranged meeting Wednesday between the envoy and senior official Andreas Michaelis. "There will certainly be a lot to discuss and that's why it's good that the ambassador will be a guest tomorrow of state secretary Michaelis," said Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. - 'Awful interview' - But in Washington, the Trump administration was standing by its controversial envoy. "Ambassadors have a right to express their opinion," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters who asked whether Grenell had expressing the views of the administration. "They're representatives of the White House, whether it's this administration or other administrations, and we hear them voicing their opinions," she said. "And they're sometimes opinions that people may or may not like. And there is the right to free speech as well." The appointment of Grenell, a hawkish supporter of Trump's "America First" stance, was long held up by US senators who objected to his allegedly disparaging tweets on female politicians and apparent refusal to take seriously claims of Russian meddling in the US election. The controversy comes as ties between Germany and the United States are strained after Trump ditched the Iran nuclear deal and imposed punishing tariffs on European aluminium and steel. Underlining the souring transatlantic relationship, Merkel has warned that Europe can no longer rely on the US to protect it and must "take its destiny into its own hands." Politicians in the US too baulked at Grenell's comments. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy tweeted that the envoy's interview with Breitbart was "awful -- ambassadors aren't supposed to 'empower' any political party overseas." - 'Why is he ambassador'? - For Juergen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman of Merkel's centre-right bloc, Grenell is simply seeking to weaken the EU. The US wants to prevent "the European Union from further integrating and becoming a stronger political and economic power," Hardt told broadcaster hr-Info. Although Merkel herself belongs to the conservative camp, commentators said Grenell was not trying to bolster the chancellor's party base, but rather its opponents from the far-right. "It is bad enough if that's what he is thinking, let alone saying it," said the daily Berliner Zeitung. Media outside Germany also weighed in, with Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum arguing that Grenell clearly intended to back "nativist, pro-Russia and anti-pluralist" forces in Europe. Grenell had certainly fulfilled his task if he was sent to Germany to destabilise Merkel's coalition or the Atlantic alliance, she said, "but if those are not his orders... then a different set of questions has to be asked." "Why is the US ambassador in Germany giving an interview to Breitbart? Why is he involving himself in partisan politics? For that matter, why is he an American ambassador at all?" Applebaum added. The Financial Times urged Berlin to respond to Grenell's "undiplomatic behaviour" by holding its line on adhering to the Iran nuclear deal, responding firmly to US tariffs as well as stepping up to its defence responsibilities.

"If a German ambassador were to say in Washington that he is there to empower the Democrats, he would have been kicked out immediately. "I hope that Kurz's visit will lead Mr Grenell's tenure as ambassador in Germany to be short," added Schulz, playing on the German word for short -- "kurz." Schulz had earlier tweeted that the US envoy did not behave like a diplomat but rather like a "far-right colonial officer." Amid the row, Germany's foreign ministry is seeking clarification from Grenell about his comments, with the topic to be raised at a pre-arranged meeting Wednesday between the envoy and senior official Andreas Michaelis. "There will certainly be a lot to discuss and that's why it's good that the ambassador will be a guest tomorrow of state secretary Michaelis," said Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. - 'Awful interview' - But in Washington, the Trump administration was standing by its controversial envoy. "Ambassadors have a right to express their opinion," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters who asked whether Grenell had expressing the views of the administration. "They're representatives of the White House, whether it's this administration or other administrations, and we hear them voicing their opinions," she said. "And they're sometimes opinions that people may or may not like. And there is the right to free speech as well." The appointment of Grenell, a hawkish supporter of Trump's "America First" stance, was long held up by US senators who objected to his allegedly disparaging tweets on female politicians and apparent refusal to take seriously claims of Russian meddling in the US election. The controversy comes as ties between Germany and the United States are strained after Trump ditched the Iran nuclear deal and imposed punishing tariffs on European aluminium and steel. Underlining the souring transatlantic relationship, Merkel has warned that Europe can no longer rely on the US to protect it and must "take its destiny into its own hands." Politicians in the US too baulked at Grenell's comments. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy tweeted that the envoy's interview with Breitbart was "awful -- ambassadors aren't supposed to 'empower' any political party overseas." - 'Why is he ambassador'? - For Juergen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman of Merkel's centre-right bloc, Grenell is simply seeking to weaken the EU. The US wants to prevent "the European Union from further integrating and becoming a stronger political and economic power," Hardt told broadcaster hr-Info. Although Merkel herself belongs to the conservative camp, commentators said Grenell was not trying to bolster the chancellor's party base, but rather its opponents from the far-right. "It is bad enough if that's what he is thinking, let alone saying it," said the daily Berliner Zeitung. Media outside Germany also weighed in, with Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum arguing that Grenell clearly intended to back "nativist, pro-Russia and anti-pluralist" forces in Europe. Grenell had certainly fulfilled his task if he was sent to Germany to destabilise Merkel's coalition or the Atlantic alliance, she said, "but if those are not his orders... then a different set of questions has to be asked." "Why is the US ambassador in Germany giving an interview to Breitbart? Why is he involving himself in partisan politics? For that matter, why is he an American ambassador at all?" Applebaum added. The Financial Times urged Berlin to respond to Grenell's "undiplomatic behaviour" by holding its line on adhering to the Iran nuclear deal, responding firmly to US tariffs as well as stepping up to its defence responsibilities.

News article:
(Adds comments from Mattis' press conference, changes dateline) By Idrees Ali BRUSSELS, June 6 (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis arrived in Brussels on Wednesday seeking to mollify European allies, again finding himself in the familiar position of mending relationships frayed by President Donald Trump's policies. Trump infuriated European Union members, Canada and Mexico by imposing tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, which experts say could bleed into U.S. security relationships, even among America's closest allies. While the meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels is a routine affair, it will be watched closely in European capitals. On his debut trip to Brussels as secretary of defense last year after Trump questioned the need for NATO, Mattis told members that while they must honor military spending pledges, the alliance was "the most successful and powerful military alliance in modern history." "This ministerial is going to be overshadowed by the tariffs issue," said a U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "Mattis is going to be looking to reassure allies, try to strengthen relationships and continue to press the need for them to live up to their 2 percent commitment," the official added. The United States has been pushing NATO countries to reach a target to spend 2 percent of economic output on defense every year by 2024. Speaking with reporters on the way to Brussels, Mattis suggested that while talks with NATO partners would be tough, he did not expect Trump's tariffs decision to have an impact on defense issues for now. "Along the path going there, certainly it'll be a little rocky, a little bumpy at times, but so far I do not anticipate any effect in the security domain," he said. Barry Pavel, a U.S. national security expert at the Atlantic Council think-tank, said while issues of national security are usually unaffected by politics, Trump's decision was far too provocative not to have an impact. "I think it was such a shock and the reactions from several allies being so unprecedented and so emotional and insulted, that I think some of that will bleed into some of the discussions at the sort of geopolitical level," Pavel said. In response to Trump's decision to impose tariffs, the EU threatened tariffs on Harley Davidson motorcycles and bourbon, measures aimed at the political bases of U.S. Republican legislators. While in Brussels, Mattis will also meet his Turkish counterpart as Washington tries to balance Ankara's concerns about Kurdish fighters among U.S.-backed SDF forces trying to retake the Islamic State's remaining territory in Syria. "How do we take Turkey's legitimate security concerns and enhance their security... at the same time, the SDF was the only organization at the time that was able to throw ISIS off the track and defeat them in the field in very, very tough fighting and we will not simply cast that organization aside," Mattis said. Turkey and the United States on Monday endorsed a roadmap for the northern Syrian city of Manbij and underlined their mutual commitment to its implementation. WANING INFLUENCE? The informal portfolio of soothing traditional U.S. friends upset by Trump's often sharp comments and tweets on foreign policy is one that the retired Marine general is becoming used to. Less than a week ago in Asia, Mattis attempted to do much the same with allies Japan and South Korea, where some officials are concerned that Trump may put U.S. security interests ahead of theirs in pursuing a peace deal with North Korea. In recent months, however, there have been growing questions about whether Mattis' voice in internal administration debates could increasingly be drowned out by those of other advisers and the president himself, who increasingly trusts his own instincts. In one notable instance, Mattis publicly suggested sticking with the Iran nuclear deal. Dismayed European allies also sought to salvage the Iran nuclear deal and preserve their Iranian trade after Trump withdrew the United States from the landmark accord and ordered sanctions reimposed on Tehran.

News article:
Jens Stoltenberg warned that splits between America and European NATO members over trade is threatening the alliance NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday he was battling to stop the increasingly bitter row between Europe and the US spilling over into the alliance, warning of 'serious disagreements' among member countries. European countries are at loggerheads with Washington over punishing new US tariffs on steel and aluminium as well as President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord. NATO defence ministers will meet in Brussels on Thursday to approve plans to beef up the alliance's ability to mobilise forces quickly in the event of a crisis, as concern about the threat from Russia shows no sign of abating. They will also sign off on two new command centres - one to protect Atlantic shipping lanes, based in Norfolk, Virginia, and another to coordinate troop movements around Europe, located in the southern German city of Ulm. But the meeting, just five weeks out from a full summit of NATO leaders, looks set to be overshadowed by the spat between European countries and their longtime ally across the Atlantic. 'There are now serious disagreements with NATO allies on serious issues,' Stoltenberg told reporters, saying he was working hard to minimise the fallout. 'As long as they're not solved I have to be focused on how to reduce, limit the negative consequences for NATO.' Stoltenberg, who held talks with Trump in Washington last month, insisted the 'transatlantic bond' remained strong and pointed to the way NATO survived major differences among members over the Iraq war in 2003 and the Suez crisis of 1956. President Trump has angered allies in the EU by imposing steep trade tariffs on aluminium and steel, with the trading bloc vowing to retaliate 'What we have seen again and again is that we have been able to unite around NATO's core task, to protect and defend each other despite those differences,' he said. The US ambassador to NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchison, insisted 'the strength of our alliance is not in jeopardy'. The Suez crisis In 1956 Britain, France and Israel invaded Egypt in an attempt to regain control of the Suez Canal which had been nationalized by Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser. While the invasion was a tactical success it led Egypt to close the canal to shipping, which drew the ire of the United States and Soviet Union. Heavy political pressured from the US and USSR, including the threat by President Eisenhower to crash the British economy by selling off government bonds, eventually led the invaders to withdraw. Advertisement 'We are strong together, we will have disagreements on other issues but we will not have disagreement about the strength of NATO and the importance of deterrence and defence for NATO and for North America,' she told reporters. The leaders of all 29 NATO members will meet in Brussels for the summit in July when all eyes will be on Trump, who has repeatedly attacked European countries for not pulling their weight in the alliance. Germany, Europe's largest economy, has suffered the worst of Trump's wrath for its failure to live up to a pledge by all NATO countries to try to spend at least two percent of gross domestic product on defence. NATO is modernising its command structure and beefing up its defences in response to growing fears about Russia, following Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Thousands of NATO troops are already stationed on standby in the Baltic states and Poland as deterrent and on Thursday defence ministers will give the go-ahead to a new US initiative called '30-30-30-30' or 'four 30s'. Under the plan, by 2020 NATO will have 30 batallions, 30 air squadrons and 30 warships ready to be used within 30 days to back up existing rapid response forces. 'This is about establishing a culture of readiness and we need that because we have a more unpredictable security environment, we have to be prepared for the unforeseen,' Stoltenberg said.

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 complementary.
The image shows NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The news article is about Jens Stoltenberg warning that splits between America and European NATO members over trade is threatening the alliance. The image is complementary to the news article because it shows one of the key figures in the story, Jens Stoltenberg, meeting with a leader of a NATO member country. The image also shows the two leaders shaking hands, which is a sign of cooperation and unity. This is in contrast to the news article, which is about the divisions within NATO. The image therefore provides a visual contrast to the news article, and helps to illustrate the story.

News article:
Seeking to soothe feathers ruffled by comments from the US ambassador to Berlin, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert only made it worse by citing the Allied landings in Normandy as an example of US ties with Germany. “We have a very strong relationship with the government of Germany,” Nauert said at a press briefing on Tuesday. “Looking back in the history books, today is the 71st anniversary of the speech that announced the Marshall Plan.

We obviously have a very long history with the government of Germany, and we have a strong relationship with the government of Germany.” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert today cited "the D-Day invasion" when talking about the long history between the American and German governments. https://t.co/UbCqKJymNipic.twitter.com/jvN2ODk3rA — Kyle Feldscher (@Kyle_Feldscher) June 5, 2018 Nauert’s choice of D-Day as an example raised eyebrows at CNN and MSNBC, but also among those who know a thing or two about the Second World War. The landing of some 150,000 US, British, Canadian and other Allied troops on the beaches of German-occupied France 74 years ago was certainly part of a “long history” between the US and Germany, but hardly a good illustration of a “strong relationship.” Yes, because D-day was all about liberating Germany from the iron grip of the French, right, Ms. Nauert? — Michael Hiltzik (@hiltzikm) June 6, 2018 The bumbling answer came after a barrage of questions were asked about statements made by Richard Grenell, the recently-appointed US ambassador to Germany. In an interview with Breitbart published on Sunday, Grenell said that conservatives from all over Europe told him there was a feeling of resurgence following the election of US President Donald Trump. “I absolutely want to empower other conservatives throughout Europe, other leaders. I think there is a groundswell of conservative policies that are taking hold because of the failed policies of the left,” he said, adding that Trump’s election has “empowered individuals and people to say that they can’t just allow the political class to determine before an election takes place, who’s going to win and who should run.” Grenell himself denied that this amounted to an overt endorsement of any particular person or political party, while Nauert argued that ambassadors have freedom of speech, just like any other American. “Look, we’re not supporting any political party. That’s not what we do. We support democracy. We support countries figuring out for themselves who they want to vote in for office,” Nauert said, apparently ignoring the long history of US meddling in other countries’ elections, “color revolutions” and forcible regime change. Grenell has been the US envoy to Berlin for less than six weeks, but he has already managed to offend the Germans by demanding they cease trading with Iran after Trump announced the US would unilaterally abandon the 2015 nuclear deal. Nauert also had to defend US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, who told reporters covering the deadly protests along the border with Gaza to “just keep your mouths shut until you figure it out.” Friedman was “explaining his opinion that some in the media, not all, but some in media organizations have not done that balanced job of reporting,” Nauert argued, blaming the Islamist organization Hamas for the casualties in Gaza. While Grenell and Friedman’s words have attracted attention as unusually undiplomatic, they are hardly the first US diplomats to meddle in the affairs of host countries or even order their governments around. Ambassadors to Belgrade, Sarajevo and Skopje have done so repeatedly. In January, for example, US Ambassador to Kosovo Greg Delawie threatened “specific and harsh consequences” to the ethnic Albanian government running that renegade Serbian province if they passed a law that Washington did not approve of.

News article:
Two former advisors from within the Canadian and US administrations have warned of the economic threat posed by US President Donald Trump ahead of the G7 summit in Canada, which kicks off today. Roland Paris, a former top foreign policy advisor to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is chairing the G7 meeting that begins Friday, and Daniel Price, a former personal representative of George W. Bush at G8 and G20 summits, think there is a chance that US President Donald Trump might cancel his participation in the summit of world leaders at the last minute. Their assessment underlines both the unpredictability of the US president and the state of affairs between the US and its major allies. "It's unlikely, but anything is possible," said Paris, responding to whether he thought Trump could skip what is shaping up to be a moment of reckoning for the president who could face stiff blowback for his recent tariff decisions. Paris drafted the foreign policy strategy for the Trudeau administration prior to its 2015 election win. Price, who served as President Bush's top international trade advisor and as his so-called "sherpa" in preparation for various international summits, added that a Trump cancellation would be "very unfortunate if it were to happen." Deep divisions The G7 summit, which will bring together the leaders of Canada, the US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, comes at a time that many view as a moment of historic division between Washington and its major allies in North America, Europe and Asia. Just days ago the Trump administration slapped stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on five of its six G7 partners. It also recently kicked off a trade investigation that could trigger additional tariffs on imported cars. The tariffs are based on what is widely seen as a spurious justification, namely that the imports present a threat to US national security, even though all countries present at the G7 meeting are NATO members alongside the US or have a long-standing security partnership with Washington like Japan. Read more: Donald Trump's EU tariffs 'foolish' and 'damaging' While the tariffs, which Europe and Canada fought hard to prevent, are the most recent, they are just the last in an increasingly long list of deep disagreements between the US and its allies. Not long before the tariff move, the Trump administration — again against the joint opposition of its allies — pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. And in a previous signature decision that rocked relations with its allies, Trump withdrew the US from the Paris climate accords after making his inaugural appearance at a G7 summit last year in Italy. Six of the seven G7 finance ministers publicly rebuked the US tariffs Image: picture-alliance/The Canadian Press/J. Hayward Public rebuke While Trump was already characterized in the US media as "the odd man out" at the last G7 meeting, divisions between the US president and the other leaders have only grown wider since. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau recently all failed to convince Trump not to impose tariffs on the allies. In a sign of how deep the rift is, six of the seven G7 finance ministers last weekend took the unusual step of issuing a joint a message rebuking Washington for imposing the tariffs. "It is true that the administration's unilateral actions on trade against US allies are eroding the longstanding bonds of mutual trust," said Price. "And when you take that together with the withdrawal from the JCPOA [the official acronym for the Iran deal — the eds.] and the threatened imposition of sanctions on our allies who want to preserve the deal, the US is looking increasingly isolated in the G7." Read more: Iran deal: Compromise with US is 'far away,' says Germany For Paris, the former Trudeau adviser, now a professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa, the current division between the US and Canada is more fundamental than any previous disagreements between the neighboring countries. Unprecedented low in US-Canadian ties "I think the situation now is unprecedented in Canada-US relations," he said. "There have been moments of tensions before, but no US administration has ever characterized Canadian imports as threats to US national security." Despite the friction between the US and its allies, which neither Price nor Paris said they believe will be resolved, they think the G7 meeting can still be valuable — if only to air the differences between the two sides. Still, the former top advisers are under no illusion that major tangible results, for example on trade, can be achieved at the meeting. Already at the previous G7 meeting in Italy Trump was characterized as 'odd man out' Image: picture-alliance/dpa/AP/E. Vucci Avoiding conflict, 'open rupture' a success "I would consider it a success if there is an honest and forthright exchange of views, and if it is brought home to the United States president how divisive and destructive his trade policy actions have been," said Price. "Under the circumstances, I would consider this summit a success if it does not produce an open rupture between the United States and its allies," said Paris. "Everything else is gravy."

The image shows a group of world leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and US President Donald Trump. The leaders are sitting in a row, with Trudeau in the center and Trump on the right. The image is taken from a high angle, which makes the leaders look small and insignificant. The background is a blur of flags, which suggests that the leaders are in a meeting or conference.

The news events set is about the G7 summit, which is a meeting of the leaders of the seven major industrialized countries. The summit is being held in Canada, and it is the first time that Trump has attended. The leaders are expected to discuss a range of issues, including trade, climate change, and security.

The image is complementary to the news events set because it provides a visual representation of the leaders who are attending the summit. The image also suggests that the leaders are divided, which is consistent with the news reports about the summit.

News article:
LA MALBAIE, Quebec (Reuters) - The United States and European Union will establish a dialogue on trade within the next two weeks, a French official said on Friday, signaling a modest step forward for bitterly divided allies at a Group of Seven summit in Canada. U.S. trading partners have been furious over President Donald Trump’s decision last week to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, the European Union and Mexico as part of his “America First” agenda. Some countries have retaliated with their own levies on U.S. imports. “The principle of a dialogue was agreed this afternoon,” the French official told reporters. “Everyone agreed, including President Trump.” While G7 leaders confronted Trump with a slew of data on imports and exports in a bid to sway his thinking, Trump countered his own numbers and held his position that the United States was at a disadvantage on international trade, an official who followed the talks said. But Trump struck a more affable tone after a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, saying the French leader was helping work out trade issues. “Something’s going to happen. I think it will be very positive,” Trump said, without giving details. Macron said it was possible to advance the trade issues that have split the U.S. and its allies. “I think, on trade, there is ... a way to progress all together,” he told reporters after his meeting with Trump. “I saw the willingness on all the sides to find agreements and have a win-win approach for our people, our workers, and our middle classes.” German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday floated an idea to set up a way to resolve trade disputes between the United States and its allies. An official described Merkel’s suggestion as a “shared assessment and dialogue” mechanism, but gave no further details. It was unclear if the technical talks were part of her initiative. The proposal was supported by other leaders present, the official said. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker offered to visit Washington for an assessment of EU-US trade to help resolve the dispute, an official said. Expectations for a major breakthrough on trade at the summit, however, remain low, with U.S. allies focused on avoiding rupturing the G7, which in its 42-year history has tended to seek consensus on major issues. “It’s highly unlikely there will be a final communique,” a G7 official said on condition of anonymity. Merkel said it was not clear whether the group would issue a final directive, adding that failure to do so would be an honest reflection of the lack of agreement among Canada, the United States, Japan, Britain, Italy, France and Germany. The EU is also attending the summit. Trump had set a combative tone before leaving Washington on Friday, saying he was “going to deal with the unfair trade practices” of other G7 members. But he was more affable after meeting Macron and Trudeau, swapping jokes with the latter before the media though neither budged on their trade positions. “We’ve had really a very good relationship, very special,” the U.S. president said of Macron, a day after the two leaders had exchanged terse messages on Twitter. “We have little tests every once in a while when it comes to trade.” Merkel and Trump also had a brief conversation at the summit but no bilateral meeting. Slideshow ( 14 images ) Trump’s “America First” message to allies has hardened since he brought hardline national security adviser John Bolton on to his team. Trump plans to leave the summit four hours earlier than originally planned to fly to Singapore to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the White House said. G7 chiefs have largely praised Trump for his efforts to stabilize the Korean peninsula, but they are unhappy he pulled out of an international agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Slideshow ( 14 images ) INVESTORS NERVOUS Canada and the EU have denounced the U.S. tariffs and Ottawa has proposed levies on a range of U.S. goods next month while the EU has pledged its own retaliatory measures. British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday warned both Trump and the EU of the dangers of entering a tit-for-tat trade war over tariffs, urging both sides to instead focus on China’s excess steel production. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said her country “will not change its mind when it comes to the illegal” application of tariffs. The spat has financial markets worried about tit-for-tit escalation. Investors are also concerned about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump has threatened to terminate. Canada and Mexico, the other members of the 1994 pact, have been frustrated by the slow pace of talks to renegotiate NAFTA.

News article:
LA MALBAIE, Quebec (Reuters) - The United States and European Union will establish a dialogue on trade within the next two weeks, a French official said on Friday, signaling a modest step forward for bitterly divided allies at a Group of Seven summit in Canada. U.S. trading partners have been furious over President Donald Trump’s decision last week to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, the European Union and Mexico as part of his “America First” agenda. Some countries have retaliated with their own levies on U.S. imports. “The principle of a dialogue was agreed this afternoon,” the French official told reporters. “Everyone agreed, including President Trump.” While G7 leaders confronted Trump with a slew of data on imports and exports in a bid to sway his thinking, Trump countered his own numbers and held his position that the United States was at a disadvantage on international trade, an official who followed the talks said. But Trump struck a more affable tone after a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, saying the French leader was helping work out trade issues. “Something’s going to happen. I think it will be very positive,” Trump said, without giving details. Macron said it was possible to advance the trade issues that have split the U.S. and its allies. “I think, on trade, there is ... a way to progress all together,” he told reporters after his meeting with Trump. “I saw the willingness on all the sides to find agreements and have a win-win approach for our people, our workers, and our middle classes.” German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday floated an idea to set up a way to resolve trade disputes between the United States and its allies. An official described Merkel’s suggestion as a “shared assessment and dialogue” mechanism, but gave no further details. It was unclear if the technical talks were part of her initiative. The proposal was supported by other leaders present, the official said. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker offered to visit Washington for an assessment of EU-US trade to help resolve the dispute, an official said. Expectations for a major breakthrough on trade at the summit, however, remain low, with U.S. allies focused on avoiding rupturing the G7, which in its 42-year history has tended to seek consensus on major issues. “It’s highly unlikely there will be a final communique,” a G7 official said on condition of anonymity. Merkel said it was not clear whether the group would issue a final directive, adding that failure to do so would be an honest reflection of the lack of agreement among Canada, the United States, Japan, Britain, Italy, France and Germany. The EU is also attending the summit. Trump had set a combative tone before leaving Washington on Friday, saying he was “going to deal with the unfair trade practices” of other G7 members. But he was more affable after meeting Macron and Trudeau, swapping jokes with the latter before the media though neither budged on their trade positions. “We’ve had really a very good relationship, very special,” the U.S. president said of Macron, a day after the two leaders had exchanged terse messages on Twitter. “We have little tests every once in a while when it comes to trade.” Merkel and Trump also had a brief conversation at the summit but no bilateral meeting. Slideshow ( 14 images ) Trump’s “America First” message to allies has hardened since he brought hardline national security adviser John Bolton on to his team. Trump plans to leave the summit four hours earlier than originally planned to fly to Singapore to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the White House said. G7 chiefs have largely praised Trump for his efforts to stabilize the Korean peninsula, but they are unhappy he pulled out of an international agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Slideshow ( 14 images ) INVESTORS NERVOUS Canada and the EU have denounced the U.S. tariffs and Ottawa has proposed levies on a range of U.S. goods next month while the EU has pledged its own retaliatory measures.

Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said her country “will not change its mind when it comes to the illegal” application of tariffs. The spat has financial markets worried about tit-for-tit escalation. Investors are also concerned about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump has threatened to terminate. Canada and Mexico, the other members of the 1994 pact, have been frustrated by the slow pace of talks to renegotiate NAFTA.

The image shows the leaders of the G7 nations, which includes the United States, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Britain, Italy, France and Germany. The leaders are standing together on a stage, which suggests that they are united. This is significant because the G7 nations have been divided in recent years, particularly over issues such as trade and climate change. The image also shows the leaders smiling and waving, which suggests that they are happy to be together and that they are working together to solve their differences. This is also significant because the G7 nations have been facing a number of challenges in recent years, including the rise of populism and protectionism. Overall, the image suggests that the G7 nations are united and that they are working together to solve their differences. This is a positive sign for the future of the world, as the G7 nations are some of the most powerful countries in the world.

News article:
European leaders are fighting back against U.S. President Donald Trump after the American leader threw a summit of the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrialized nations into disarray by withdrawing his endorsement of a statement he initially had accepted. Late on June 9, Trump tweeted that based on “false statements” by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who hosted the G7 summit in Quebec, he had instructed U.S. representatives not to endorse the final communique, which the Canadian leader had said was agreed to by all G7 nations. In recent weeks, trading partners of the United States have criticized new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports imposed by the Trump administration. At a news conference after the summit, Trudeau reiterated his opposition to the U.S. tariffs and vowed to "move forward with retaliatory measures" in July. "I have made it very clear to the president that it is not something we relish doing, but it something that we absolutely will do," he said. "Canadians, we're polite, we're reasonable, but we also will not be pushed around." As Trump flew from the summit to a planned meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, he lashed out at Trudeau, saying he “acted so meek and mild during our G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, ‘US Tariffs were kind of insulting’ and he ‘will not be pushed around.’” “Very dishonest & weak. Our Tariffs are in response to his of [sic] 270% on dairy!” Trump wrote. Trudeau’s office released a statement quoting the prime minister as saying that he said nothing at the G7 that he hadn’t told Trump in person and voiced publicly before. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on June 10 that Trump's revocation of support for the joint communique was "sobering and a little depressing." "It's hard, it's depressing this time, but that's not the end" of the G7, she said in an interview with ARD public television, adding that the European Union is preparing countermeasures against U.S. tariffs. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas made a veiled barb at Trump, tweeting: "With one tweet, an unsettling amount of trust can be very quickly destroyed." "It is even more important that Europe stands together and even more aggressively represents its interests," Maas added. In Paris, a French presidency official said France and Europe stood by the G7 communique and anyone departing from the commitments made at the summit would be showing their "incoherence and inconsistency." "International cooperation cannot depend on being angry and on sound bites. Let's be serious," the official said. But Trump's economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told CNN that Trudeau "stabbed us in the back." "There is a special place in hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door," White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox News. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland later said that Canada "does not conduct its diplomacy through ad hominem attacks." "We don't think that that is a useful or productive way to do business, and perhaps we refrain particularly from ad hominem attacks when it comes to our relationship with our allies," she added. The eight-page G7 communique issued earlier stated that “we stand ready to take further restrictive measures to increase costs on Russia” if its behavior makes it necessary. It also demanded that Russia "cease its destabilizing behavior, to undermine democratic systems, and its support of the Syrian regime." The communique was issued after tumultuous summit that mainly had Washington squaring off against its longtime allies over Russia, trade, climate issues, and the Iran nuclear accord. Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed criticism by the G7 as "creative babbling" and said at a summit in China on June 10 that it was time for all sides to resume cooperation. "I believe it's necessary to stop this creative babbling and shift to concrete issues related to real cooperation," Putin told reporters when asked to comment on the joint statement. He added that the G7 countries had "again" failed to provide any evidence that Russia was behind the poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter in Britain in March. Because of the disputes, many observers were not certain a statement would be issued under all seven countries' names. Still, the meeting did not appear to bring the sides much closer together. The G7 consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, and the United States. Trump had shocked many of allies with repeated calls for Russia to be readmitted into the group, which was known as the G8 when Moscow was a member of the association of the world’s leading industrial nations. Trump told journalists on June 9 that "it would be an asset to have Russia back in." In response, Putin said on June 10 that Russia did not choose to leave the group and would be happy to see its member countries in Moscow. He also said he's ready to meet with Trump once the White House is ready for a summit. Many states have voiced an interest in hosting the meeting, including Austria, Putin said. It would be the first bilateral summit between the two leaders since Trump took office in January 2017. Trump and Putin have only ever spoken briefly on the sidelines of major events. European Union countries, which make up four of the group's seven members, agreed ahead of the summit that "a return of Russia to the G7-format summits can't happen until substantial progress has been made in connection with the problems with Ukraine," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said as the summit began on June 8. At the summit's end, Trudeau said he told Trump that he was "not remotely interested" in seeing Russia return to the G7. British Prime Minister Theresa May also welcomed that the G7 statement recognized the need to maintain sanctions on Russia. The statement made no reference to Russia being invited back into the G7, but the leaders did say they would continue "to engage with Russia on addressing regional crises and global challenges, where it is in our interests." Russia was expelled from the group four years ago after annexing Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and fueling a war in eastern Ukraine that has killed at least 10,300 people. Trump was asked if he thought Russia's control over Crimea should be recognized by the international community, but he avoided answering directly and instead blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the situation. "Crimea was let go during the Obama administration and, you know, Obama can say all he wants, but he allowed Russia to take Crimea," Trump said. "But, with that being said," he added, "it's been done a long time." Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on June 9 said Moscow was not seeking to rejoin the group. He added that Russia was "working fine in other formats," such as the G20. Although Merkel said the “common view" in Europe was to continue to exclude Russia, Italy's new prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, echoed Trump's call for returning Russia to the "negotiating table" in a post on Twitter. U.S. allies said they were stunned by Trump's friendly gesture toward Russia, especially considering his move last month to cite "national security" reasons for threatening to impose tariffs on the steel imports of major U.S. allies. Many U.S. lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, have also expressed concern about Trump's departure from past U.S. views on trade, Russia, and the international order. Trump has been open on his desires for better relations with Moscow. Republican Senator John McCain, who has been at loggerheads with Trump over many issues lately, tweeted his displeasure at the president’s actions in Quebec. “To our allies: bipartisan majorities of Americans remain pro-free trade, pro-globalization & supportive of alliances based on 70 years of shared values. Americans stand with you, even if our president doesn’t,” he wrote. The G7 leaders also said they were "committed to permanently ensuring that Iran's nuclear program remains peaceful in line with its international obligations and commitments to never seek, develop, or acquire a nuclear weapon." "We condemn all financial support of terrorism including terrorist groups sponsored by Iran. We also call upon Iran to play a constructive role by contributing to efforts to counter terrorism and achieve political solutions, reconciliation, and peace in the region," the statement added. It did not specifically mention the 2015 nuclear accord, which provided Tehran with relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear program. Trump withdrew from the pact in May against the wishes of the allies and Russia and China. With reporting by AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters, and the BBC

Trudeau’s office released a statement quoting the prime minister as saying that he said nothing at the G7 that he hadn’t told Trump in person and voiced publicly before. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on June 10 that Trump's revocation of support for the joint communique was "sobering and a little depressing." "It's hard, it's depressing this time, but that's not the end" of the G7, she said in an interview with ARD public television, adding that the European Union is preparing countermeasures against U.S. tariffs. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas made a veiled barb at Trump, tweeting: "With one tweet, an unsettling amount of trust can be very quickly destroyed." "It is even more important that Europe stands together and even more aggressively represents its interests," Maas added. In Paris, a French presidency official said France and Europe stood by the G7 communique and anyone departing from the commitments made at the summit would be showing their "incoherence and inconsistency." "International cooperation cannot depend on being angry and on sound bites. Let's be serious," the official said. But Trump's economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told CNN that Trudeau "stabbed us in the back." "There is a special place in hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door," White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox News. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland later said that Canada "does not conduct its diplomacy through ad hominem attacks." "We don't think that that is a useful or productive way to do business, and perhaps we refrain particularly from ad hominem attacks when it comes to our relationship with our allies," she added. The eight-page G7 communique issued earlier stated that “we stand ready to take further restrictive measures to increase costs on Russia” if its behavior makes it necessary. It also demanded that Russia "cease its destabilizing behavior, to undermine democratic systems, and its support of the Syrian regime." The communique was issued after tumultuous summit that mainly had Washington squaring off against its longtime allies over Russia, trade, climate issues, and the Iran nuclear accord. Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed criticism by the G7 as "creative babbling" and said at a summit in China on June 10 that it was time for all sides to resume cooperation. "I believe it's necessary to stop this creative babbling and shift to concrete issues related to real cooperation," Putin told reporters when asked to comment on the joint statement. He added that the G7 countries had "again" failed to provide any evidence that Russia was behind the poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter in Britain in March. Because of the disputes, many observers were not certain a statement would be issued under all seven countries' names. Still, the meeting did not appear to bring the sides much closer together. The G7 consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, and the United States. Trump had shocked many of allies with repeated calls for Russia to be readmitted into the group, which was known as the G8 when Moscow was a member of the association of the world’s leading industrial nations. Trump told journalists on June 9 that "it would be an asset to have Russia back in." In response, Putin said on June 10 that Russia did not choose to leave the group and would be happy to see its member countries in Moscow. He also said he's ready to meet with Trump once the White House is ready for a summit. Many states have voiced an interest in hosting the meeting, including Austria, Putin said. It would be the first bilateral summit between the two leaders since Trump took office in January 2017. Trump and Putin have only ever spoken briefly on the sidelines of major events. European Union countries, which make up four of the group's seven members, agreed ahead of the summit that "a return of Russia to the G7-format summits can't happen until substantial progress has been made in connection with the problems with Ukraine," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said as the summit began on June 8. At the summit's end, Trudeau said he told Trump that he was "not remotely interested" in seeing Russia return to the G7. British Prime Minister Theresa May also welcomed that the G7 statement recognized the need to maintain sanctions on Russia. The statement made no reference to Russia being invited back into the G7, but the leaders did say they would continue "to engage with Russia on addressing regional crises and global challenges, where it is in our interests." Russia was expelled from the group four years ago after annexing Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and fueling a war in eastern Ukraine that has killed at least 10,300 people. Trump was asked if he thought Russia's control over Crimea should be recognized by the international community, but he avoided answering directly and instead blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the situation. "Crimea was let go during the Obama administration and, you know, Obama can say all he wants, but he allowed Russia to take Crimea," Trump said. "But, with that being said," he added, "it's been done a long time." Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on June 9 said Moscow was not seeking to rejoin the group. He added that Russia was "working fine in other formats," such as the G20. Although Merkel said the “common view" in Europe was to continue to exclude Russia, Italy's new prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, echoed Trump's call for returning Russia to the "negotiating table" in a post on Twitter. U.S. allies said they were stunned by Trump's friendly gesture toward Russia, especially considering his move last month to cite "national security" reasons for threatening to impose tariffs on the steel imports of major U.S. allies. Many U.S. lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, have also expressed concern about Trump's departure from past U.S. views on trade, Russia, and the international order. Trump has been open on his desires for better relations with Moscow. Republican Senator John McCain, who has been at loggerheads with Trump over many issues lately, tweeted his displeasure at the president’s actions in Quebec. “To our allies: bipartisan majorities of Americans remain pro-free trade, pro-globalization & supportive of alliances based on 70 years of shared values. Americans stand with you, even if our president doesn’t,” he wrote. The G7 leaders also said they were "committed to permanently ensuring that Iran's nuclear program remains peaceful in line with its international obligations and commitments to never seek, develop, or acquire a nuclear weapon." "We condemn all financial support of terrorism including terrorist groups sponsored by Iran. We also call upon Iran to play a constructive role by contributing to efforts to counter terrorism and achieve political solutions, reconciliation, and peace in the region," the statement added. It did not specifically mention the 2015 nuclear accord, which provided Tehran with relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear program. Trump withdrew from the pact in May against the wishes of the allies and Russia and China. With reporting by AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters, and the BBC

News article:
President Donald Trump arrived in Quebec, Canada Friday for what is likely to be an incredibly tense meeting of the economic superpowers known as the Group of 7 (G7) — Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, and the U.S. The meeting is expected to be tense, and this is largely Trump’s fault. Some experts have even dubbed the meeting the G6+1 to mark how isolated Trump has become from the other world leaders. In recent weeks, he has imposed a number of punitive tariffs on the European Union and Canada, which only served to heighten the tension between the U.S. and its allies that has been brewing since Trump announced he was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement. On Friday, Trump suggested that Russia should be reinstated in the group, despite its expulsion in 2014 for President Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea. Trump faces a tough crowd of his own making. In the days leading up to the summit, he’s fumed about his fellow G7 leaders, and in some cases they’ve bitten back. Here are some choice quotes in the war of words. ‘We don’t mind being six, if needs be’ Tensions continued to mount as Trump headed to Canada on Friday morning. Hours before, French President Emmanuel Macron offered a veiled warning to his U.S. counterpart, who had continued to mouth off against his G7 peers. “Maybe the American president doesn’t care about being isolated today, but we don’t mind being six, if needs be,” Macron said, per Reuters.

It was apparently a reference to the War of 1812, in which case it was erroneous — it was the British who did it. Story continues ‘If we explained to people how sausages were made, it’s unlikely they’d keep eating them’ This was Macron after a phone call with Trump that White House aides described as “terrible.” Macron declined to share his own sentiments on the phone call, invoking the Prussian statesman Otto von Bismarck in a conversation with reporters. “So I like it when people see the finished meal, but I’m not convinced the kitchen commentary helps with delivering the meal or eating it.” ‘Unjustified and deeply disappointing’ This is how British Prime Minister Theresa May described Trump’s latest tariffs on steel and aluminum coming out of Europe. The comment underscored the awkward tensions rising between the U.S. and one of its oldest allies. ‘There will be difficult discussions’ German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed cynicism earlier this week about her prospects for the G7 summit, slyly faulting the Trump administration for its abandoning of old allegiances. “We have a serious problem with multilateral agreements, and that’s why there will be contentious discussions”, she said, per AFP.

News article:
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, U.S. President Donald Trump, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and France's President Emmanuel Macron chat during a family photo at the G7 Summit in the Charlevoix city of La Malbaie, Quebec, Canada, June 8, 2018. (Xinhua/REUTERS) QUEBEC CITY, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Seven (G7) summit, which kicked off here on Friday, is expected to be a tough meeting between the United States and its allies amid raising concerns over U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The leaders of the G7, the world's most powerful industrialized countries including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Japan and the United States, meet every year to discuss collaboration on issues like world economy, climate change, security and peace. Upon his arrival in the Charlevoix city of La Malbaie, Quebec, U.S. President Donald Trump had a brief discussion with French President Emmanuel Macron on issues concerning trade and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), according to media reports. The official themes for this year's summit include increasing investments and creating jobs to boost growth and advancing gender equality. However, the confrontation over Washington's unilateral decision to impose metal tariffs on imports from the European Union (EU) and Canada might dominate the summit. Trump's rejection of the global climate accord and Iran nuclear deal have also divided the G7. "It appears to be one against six since none of the other countries took aggressive action against the U.S. and it is the U.S. attacking its own allies," said Perrin Beatty, president and chief executive officer of the 200,000-member Canadian Chamber of Commerce, in an interview. The head of Canada's largest business association is at a nearby media center looking for signs as to whether Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- and the European Union (EU) as a participant -- can convince the United States to rethink its anti-trade strategy. "What we have is a president who has undermined the trust of the other six leaders around the table, and that will make it much more difficult to have a common front on other issues as well," said Beatty, a former senior Canadian cabinet minister. In response to the U.S. import tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, Canada followed the EU's lead and threatened to impose its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Canada has announced import duties against U.S. steel and aluminum as well as 71 categories of consumer and industrial goods that target the home states of prominent Republican members of Congress, such as fruit jams from Wisconsin -- the home state of House Speaker Paul Ryan -- and whiskies from Kentucky, -- the home state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. "We are hurt and we're insulted," said Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland in a recent CNN interview on the U.S. tariffs against Canada. Beatty credited the Canadian government with crafting the tariffs -- which would come into effect on July 1 if the Trump administration didn't withdraw its import taxes -- to "maximize the impact within certain regions of the U.S. while minimizing the impact on Canada, and trying to find, wherever possible, a Canadian or other supplier to provide the products." However, he said Canada's business community has a "real concern" with how Trump is attacking what should be the goal of having "free and open" trade. "We've seen a succession of measures taken by the president directed at close allies and friends of the U.S. that are destructive, and that will inflict serious and direct damage on the U.S. economy as well as its partners' economies," said Beatty. "Yet he seems oblivious to the consequences." A tariff the U.S. Commerce Department imposed earlier this year on Canadian newsprint has increased costs for newspaper publishers and now imperils the fate of local papers across the United States, Beatty said. The Trump administration has also slapped tougher tariffs on Canada's softwood lumber industry, but that has resulted in driving up the cost of housing and furniture in the United States and making American furniture manufacturers less competitive, Beatty said. The trade war could heat up further if Trump next targets Canada's auto industry, which exports about 80 percent of the vehicles it manufactures to the United States, or Canada's dairy industry, based on the president's recent tweet that "Canada has treated our Agricultural business and Farmers very poorly for a very long period of time." All of these actions further erode any hope that the North American Free Trade Agreement, currently under renegotiation by the United States, Canada and Mexico, will survive, according to Beatty. "President Trump has made it clear that he is less interested in having an agreement when the United States wins than in having one where everyone loses," he said. "It is a great irony that he casts himself as a businessman. In business, whether you are a customer or a supplier, you want to ensure that both have a fair deal that is mutually beneficial and you never want a situation where someone feels victimized." "Yet this seems to be President Trump's strategy. He sees trade as a zero-sum game in which the United States can advance only if others lose," he said. Beatty said he has never before witnessed such rancor directed from a U.S. government to its Canadian counterpart since coming to Ottawa in 1972 when he was elected to the House of Commons as a Member of Parliament for the then-Progressive Conservative Party at the age of 22. "I have never seen an instance like this where doing trade with each other is a bad thing - particularly when Canada is a close trading partner with the U.S., and has the closest relationship with the U.S. militarily, diplomatically, culturally and economically than with any other country in the world," he said. The White House said that Trump will miss the G7 meeting on climate change as he will leave the two-day meeting earlier than originally planned. Trump on Friday fired off tough tweets directed at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Macron and the EU on trade issues, saying he is looking forward to "straightening out unfair Trade Deals" with the G7 countries. At the end of the summit, the leaders hope to sign a joint statement detailing the policy positions and initiatives they agree on. France and Germany have warned that they will not sign the final agreement unless Washington makes some major policy concession. The summit took place against a backdrop of Trump creating the highest level of tension between the United States and its allies in decades, from trade to the Iran deal to NAFTA, according to an article published on the latest issue of the New Yorker. On Thursday morning, Trump tweeted that he was "getting ready to go to the G-7 in Canada to fight for our country on Trade." But other G7 leaders were preparing for an America more alone than ever before, and now Trump faces the very real risk of allies teaming up against him, the article said. "The American president may not mind being isolated, but neither do we mind signing a 6 country agreement if need be," Macron tweeted later on Thursday. "Under Trump, 'America first' really is turning out to be America Alone," the New Yorker's article said. Before departing to Canada for this year's G7 summit, Trump told media that Russia should be invited back into the G7 meeting. His claim was unanimously opposed by the European members of the G7, the French president's office said Friday.

News article:
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, U.S. President Donald Trump, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and France's President Emmanuel Macron chat during a family photo at the G7 Summit in the Charlevoix city of La Malbaie, Quebec, Canada, June 8, 2018. (Xinhua/REUTERS) QUEBEC CITY, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Seven (G7) summit, which kicked off here on Friday, is expected to be a tough meeting between the United States and its allies amid raising concerns over U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The leaders of the G7, the world's most powerful industrialized countries including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Japan and the United States, meet every year to discuss collaboration on issues like world economy, climate change, security and peace. Upon his arrival in the Charlevoix city of La Malbaie, Quebec, U.S. President Donald Trump had a brief discussion with French President Emmanuel Macron on issues concerning trade and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), according to media reports. The official themes for this year's summit include increasing investments and creating jobs to boost growth and advancing gender equality. However, the confrontation over Washington's unilateral decision to impose metal tariffs on imports from the European Union (EU) and Canada might dominate the summit. Trump's rejection of the global climate accord and Iran nuclear deal have also divided the G7. "It appears to be one against six since none of the other countries took aggressive action against the U.S. and it is the U.S. attacking its own allies," said Perrin Beatty, president and chief executive officer of the 200,000-member Canadian Chamber of Commerce, in an interview. The head of Canada's largest business association is at a nearby media center looking for signs as to whether Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- and the European Union (EU) as a participant -- can convince the United States to rethink its anti-trade strategy. "What we have is a president who has undermined the trust of the other six leaders around the table, and that will make it much more difficult to have a common front on other issues as well," said Beatty, a former senior Canadian cabinet minister. In response to the U.S. import tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, Canada followed the EU's lead and threatened to impose its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Canada has announced import duties against U.S. steel and aluminum as well as 71 categories of consumer and industrial goods that target the home states of prominent Republican members of Congress, such as fruit jams from Wisconsin -- the home state of House Speaker Paul Ryan -- and whiskies from Kentucky, -- the home state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. "We are hurt and we're insulted," said Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland in a recent CNN interview on the U.S. tariffs against Canada. Beatty credited the Canadian government with crafting the tariffs -- which would come into effect on July 1 if the Trump administration didn't withdraw its import taxes -- to "maximize the impact within certain regions of the U.S. while minimizing the impact on Canada, and trying to find, wherever possible, a Canadian or other supplier to provide the products." However, he said Canada's business community has a "real concern" with how Trump is attacking what should be the goal of having "free and open" trade. "We've seen a succession of measures taken by the president directed at close allies and friends of the U.S. that are destructive, and that will inflict serious and direct damage on the U.S. economy as well as its partners' economies," said Beatty. "Yet he seems oblivious to the consequences." A tariff the U.S. Commerce Department imposed earlier this year on Canadian newsprint has increased costs for newspaper publishers and now imperils the fate of local papers across the United States, Beatty said. The Trump administration has also slapped tougher tariffs on Canada's softwood lumber industry, but that has resulted in driving up the cost of housing and furniture in the United States and making American furniture manufacturers less competitive, Beatty said. The trade war could heat up further if Trump next targets Canada's auto industry, which exports about 80 percent of the vehicles it manufactures to the United States, or Canada's dairy industry, based on the president's recent tweet that "Canada has treated our Agricultural business and Farmers very poorly for a very long period of time." All of these actions further erode any hope that the North American Free Trade Agreement, currently under renegotiation by the United States, Canada and Mexico, will survive, according to Beatty. "President Trump has made it clear that he is less interested in having an agreement when the United States wins than in having one where everyone loses," he said. "It is a great irony that he casts himself as a businessman. In business, whether you are a customer or a supplier, you want to ensure that both have a fair deal that is mutually beneficial and you never want a situation where someone feels victimized." "Yet this seems to be President Trump's strategy. He sees trade as a zero-sum game in which the United States can advance only if others lose," he said. Beatty said he has never before witnessed such rancor directed from a U.S. government to its Canadian counterpart since coming to Ottawa in 1972 when he was elected to the House of Commons as a Member of Parliament for the then-Progressive Conservative Party at the age of 22. "I have never seen an instance like this where doing trade with each other is a bad thing - particularly when Canada is a close trading partner with the U.S., and has the closest relationship with the U.S. militarily, diplomatically, culturally and economically than with any other country in the world," he said.

News article:
Frankfurt – One viral photo is telling it all about tensions at the G-7 summit. A picture of U.S. President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel displaying less-than-friendly body language is turning out to be a defining image of the contentious meeting of the Group of Seven leaders of the world’s advanced economies. The picture, snapped Saturday by German government photographer Jesco Denzel, shows a standing Merkel with her hands firmly planted on a table staring down at Trump, who is seated with his arms folded and eyes glaring. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stands next to Trump, also with folded arms, as French President Emmanuel Macron leans in next to Merkel. The photo was tweeted by Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert. Shortly afterward, the White House issued a separate photo showing a sitting Trump speaking as Merkel, Abe and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau listen. The BBC parsed the picture by identifying all nine individuals in it, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, who is barely visible, and Larry Kudlow, head of Trump’s National Economic Council as well as several Japanese officials and U.S. national security adviser John Bolton. Another image of the same gathering however suggests a more relaxed interaction, with Merkel smiling and Trump making eye contact. The G-7 — an informal annual summit of democracies with highly developed economies — took place Friday and Saturday in the Quebec resort town of Charlevoix in Canada, which holds the rotating leadership this year. Saturday’s picture was not the first awkward moment between Trump and Merkel, who makes no secret of her disagreement with the American leader’s approach on trade, his rejection of the deal to limit Iran’s nuclear program and his decision to take the United States out of the global Paris deal to fight climate change. Merkel’s March 2017 visit to the White House was marked by Trump either not hearing or ignoring her offer to shake hands in the Oval Office. A subsequent visit in April this year warranted only a working lunch for the German leader, several days after fellow EU leader Macron got the full, formal state dinner treatment from Trump. The Charlevoix G-7 summit was marked by sharp disagreements over Trump’s decision to impose higher import taxes on aluminum and steel imports. The measure hits EU trading partners even though the main target is overcapacity at state-backed Chinese producers, who Europe and the U.S. have long complained have flooded markets with cheap steel. The G-7 summit participants managed to patch over their disagreements and agree to disagree on some issues in a joint final statement. Yet after leaving the summit, Trump tweeted that he would instruct U.S. officials not to endorse the G-7 statement, after objecting to comments from summit host Trudeau.

* Twitter messages can destroy trust in seconds-German minister * France, Germany stand by G7 communique (Adds quotes) By Michael Nienaber BERLIN, June 10 (Reuters) - Germany and France on Sunday sharply criticised U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to abruptly withdraw his support for a Group of Seven communique, accusing him of destroying trust and acting inconsistently. Having left the G7 summit in Canada early, Trump's announcement on Twitter that he was backing out of the joint communique torpedoed what appeared to be a fragile consensus on a trade dispute between Washington and its top allies. Trump also took aim at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and said he might double down on import tariffs by hitting the sensitive auto industry, throwing the G7's efforts to show a united front into disarray. G7 members Germany and France said they stood by the communique despite Trump's decision. "In a matter of seconds, you can destroy trust with 280 Twitter characters," German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said when asked about Trump's U-turn, adding it would take much longer to rebuild lost trust. Trump's conduct was "actually not a real surprise, we have seen this with the climate agreement or the Iran deal," Maas, a senior member of the Social Democrats, a partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition, told reporters in Berlin. France and Europe are standing by the G7 communique, a French presidency official said, adding anyone departing from the commitments made at the summit would be showing their "incoherence and inconsistency". "International cooperation cannot depend on being angry and on sound bites. Let's be serious," the French official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. Trump has infuriated the European Union, Canada and Mexico by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Trump and European allies are also at odds over Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris agreement to combat global warming. "We have to keep a cool head now and draw the right conclusions," Maas said. Europe's answer must be to stick even closer together, defend its interests and strengthen alliances with countries such as Japan and Canada, he said. "Europe united is the answer to America First," Maas said in a tweet. A German government spokesman said that Berlin continues to support the G7 communique despite Trump's decision. "Germany stands by the jointly agreed communique," spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement. The top White House economic adviser accused Canada's prime minister on Sunday of betraying Trump with "polarising" statements on U.S. trade policy that risked undermining the American leader on the eve of a historic summit with North Korea. Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, lashed out at Trudeau as "amateurish" and "sophomoric" for a news conference he gave after Trump left the G7 summit on Saturday. In his press conference, Trudeau had spoken of retaliatory measures that Canada would take next month in response to Trump's decision to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

* Twitter messages can destroy trust in seconds-German minister * France, Germany stand by G7 communique (Adds quotes) By Michael Nienaber BERLIN, June 10 (Reuters) - Germany and France on Sunday sharply criticised U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to abruptly withdraw his support for a Group of Seven communique, accusing him of destroying trust and acting inconsistently. Having left the G7 summit in Canada early, Trump's announcement on Twitter that he was backing out of the joint communique torpedoed what appeared to be a fragile consensus on a trade dispute between Washington and its top allies. Trump also took aim at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and said he might double down on import tariffs by hitting the sensitive auto industry, throwing the G7's efforts to show a united front into disarray.

News article:
The G7 finished up on Saturday in Canada after one of the group’s most challenging summits. Far from serving as the latest annual affirmation that key western powers are aligned, the session showcased significant splits and occasional remarkable personal animosity between US President Donald Trump and other leaders. On a range of issues from trade to climate change and Iran, the US president — who made a pre-scheduled decision to leave the summit in Quebec early on Saturday — appears to be dividing from G7 partners at a time of significant geopolitical and international economic turbulence giving rise to talk of a “G6 plus 1”. And this shift was given added spice in recent days by a spate of undiplomatic language, including Trump’s characterisation of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as “so indignant” while the latter called the US president’s trade tariffs “laughable”. To be sure, G7 policy fissures did not begin with Trump’s election in 2016, but they have been exacerbated by it. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, there have been a series of intra-western disagreements, from Middle Eastern issues — including the Iraq war opposed in 2003 by France and Germany — through to the rise of China with some European powers and the United States having disagreements over the best way to engage the rising super power. Yet, despite occasional discord, G7 states generally continued to agree until the Trump presidency around a broad range of issues such as international trade; backing for a Middle Eastern peace process between Israel and the Palestinians along Oslo principles; plus strong support for the international rules-based system and the supranational organisations that make this work. Yet today, more of these key principles are being disrupted if not outright undermined by Trump’s agenda. Take the example of international trade which saw Trump isolated in Canada following the US imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports against all its G7 partners. The tensions over trade are especially salient for the G7 hosts Canada given that Trump also warned, again, last week that he is considering scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). In this contentious context, Trudeau pushed an agenda at the summit that included trade, tackling income and gender equality, female empowerment, climate change, and peace and security. With the Trump tensions, discussion over numerous of these issues was stymied — as proved the case last year at the Italian-hosted event too. In this atmosphere of discord, significant emphasis was put at the meeting on finding greater G7 consensus on a range of security and geopolitical issues. Examples here included the upcoming Singapore summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, plus the continuing clampdown against Daesh (the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) in Syria and Iraq. Despite Trump calling Friday for Russia to be allow to rejoin the group (as the G8), as was the case from 1997 to 2013, G7 leaders called for a “rapid and unified” response to malign international interference, including by Moscow, such as cyber and chemical weapon attacks like those recently in Salisbury, England. Despite the US president’s desire for warmer ties with Vladimir Putin, there is little sign that Russia will be invited back to the club any time soon after being told it can only rejoin if “it changes course and an environment is once again created in which it is possible for the G8 to hold reasonable discussions.” The G7 also expressed concerns over the process leading to the re-election of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Western leaders remain worried about the destabilising geopolitical and economic impact of the Caracas crisis for the wider region, including bordering states of Brazil and Colombia, and the fact that Venezuela is the third-largest oil exporter to the United States and has the world’s largest proven oil reserves. The G7’s emphasis on such issues underlines, yet again, the group’s often under-appreciated importance as an international security linchpin — despite the fact that it was originally conceived in the 1970s to monitor developments in the world economy and assess macroeconomic policies. Last year’s Italy summit, for instance, was dominated by the aftermath of the Manchester terrorist attacks and development of a new G7 terrorism action plan; plus the-then brewing nuclear tensions on the Korean peninsula. In Italy, Trump also pushed other G7 members for Nato to become a full member of the global coalition against Daesh. The G7’s involvement in this multitude of geopolitical dialogues is not without controversy given its original macroeconomic mandate. For instance, China strongly objected to discussion of maritime security in Asia at the 2016 Japan-hosted summit. It is sometimes asserted, especially by developing countries, that the G7 lacks the legitimacy of the UN to engage in these geopolitical issues, and/or is a historical artefact given the rise of new powers, including China and India. However, it is not the case that the international security role of the G7 is new. An early example of the linchpin function the body has played here was in the 1970s and 1980s when it helped coordinate Western strategy towards the then-Soviet Union. Moreover, following the September 2001 terrorist attacks, the then-G8 (including Russia) assumed a key role in the US-led ‘campaign against terrorism’. Taken overall, this year’s G7 saw significant splits, especially on trade. While some of these fissures pre-date the Trump presidency, his agenda has grown these gaps into what could soon become unprecedented strains in the western alliance.

© Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg U.S. Isolationism Migration Tensions Chancellor Angela Merkel made a forceful pitch for Europe to play a more assertive role in global affairs as U.S. President Donald Trump dismantles the post-World War II order, setting the stage for a potential tense standoff at the Group of Seven summit this week.The German leader again questioned the durability of trans-Atlantic relations by referring to eye-raising comments she made over a year ago in which she said that "the times when we could fully rely on others are to some extent over." Those words, spoken at a beer-tent election rally, were a reaction to Trump hectoring European leaders for not spending enough on defense at a North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels. Since then, more fuel has been added to the fire."That was my takeaway from the NATO summit, and in the meantime I continue to feel confirmed by my statement," Merkel said in Munich on Wednesday, this time to a meeting of the European People's Party, a grouping of center-right parties in the European Parliament.In addition to the disruptive effects of the rift in NATO and Trump's exit from the Paris global climate treaty, Merkel pointed to the fresh conflict over trade and the U.S. leader's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear accord last month.Merkel told the EPP.The German chancellor has taken a firmer stance leading up to the two-day G-7 gathering in Canada, which starts Friday. Earlier on Wednesday, Europe's most experienced government leader vowed to challenge Trump on trade and climate, saying the lack of room for compromise means leaders may fail to agree on a final statement.Trump's "America First" doctrine shows that "we have a serious problem with multilateral agreements," Merkel told German lawmakers, adding that failure to reach common ground could lead to the highly unusual step of host Canada issuing a concluding statement not agreed to by all participants.With Trump's unpredictable leadership and the U.S. turn toward isolationism , Merkel said that the European Union needs to hone its response to a raft of issues in an environment in which global institutions need to be "newly proven."The 28-member bloc -- soon to lose the U.K. after the 2016 referendum to exit the EU -- managed to grapple with a financial meltdown and the biggest influx of refugees since World War II only with "great effort," Merkel said. "But we don't have a sufficient foundation to confront crises of the future," she added, underscoring her push for reforms.To give the region more political heft, she called for joint action on security and migration, saying the bloc should "Europeanize" its presence on the United Nations Security Council. A rotating group of about 10 member states could work with veto-power France and the European Commission in order to "speak with one European voice" on the global stage, the chancellor said.The effort involves resolving tensions over migration. The contentious issue has driven a wedge between states calling for asylum seekers to be distributed within the bloc and those -- particularly in central and eastern Europe -- insisting migrants must be kept out.Merkel said, citing freedom of movement across the EU's borders.

Those words, spoken at a beer-tent election rally, were a reaction to Trump hectoring European leaders for not spending enough on defense at a North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels. Since then, more fuel has been added to the fire."That was my takeaway from the NATO summit, and in the meantime I continue to feel confirmed by my statement," Merkel said in Munich on Wednesday, this time to a meeting of the European People's Party, a grouping of center-right parties in the European Parliament.In addition to the disruptive effects of the rift in NATO and Trump's exit from the Paris global climate treaty, Merkel pointed to the fresh conflict over trade and the U.S. leader's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear accord last month.Merkel told the EPP.The German chancellor has taken a firmer stance leading up to the two-day G-7 gathering in Canada, which starts Friday. Earlier on Wednesday, Europe's most experienced government leader vowed to challenge Trump on trade and climate, saying the lack of room for compromise means leaders may fail to agree on a final statement.Trump's "America First" doctrine shows that "we have a serious problem with multilateral agreements," Merkel told German lawmakers, adding that failure to reach common ground could lead to the highly unusual step of host Canada issuing a concluding statement not agreed to by all participants.With Trump's unpredictable leadership and the U.S. turn toward isolationism , Merkel said that the European Union needs to hone its response to a raft of issues in an environment in which global institutions need to be "newly proven."The 28-member bloc -- soon to lose the U.K. after the 2016 referendum to exit the EU -- managed to grapple with a financial meltdown and the biggest influx of refugees since World War II only with "great effort," Merkel said. "But we don't have a sufficient foundation to confront crises of the future," she added, underscoring her push for reforms.To give the region more political heft, she called for joint action on security and migration, saying the bloc should "Europeanize" its presence on the United Nations Security Council. A rotating group of about 10 member states could work with veto-power France and the European Commission in order to "speak with one European voice" on the global stage, the chancellor said.The effort involves resolving tensions over migration. The contentious issue has driven a wedge between states calling for asylum seekers to be distributed within the bloc and those -- particularly in central and eastern Europe -- insisting migrants must be kept out.Merkel said, citing freedom of movement across the EU's borders.

Belgian politician Alain Destexhe from the Reformist Movement party believes that the summit was a failure because of Trudeau's jibe at the United States. "Justin Trudeau has played with fire. There was an agreement. Why on earth does he feel he has to add a layer of insults and personal attacks on Donald Trump in the closing press conference? It is childish. Trudeau is responsible for this failure," Destexhe told Sputnik. Transatlantic Partnerships in Disarray The G7 summit showed clearly that the transatlantic alliance is not in the best shape at the moment, torn apart by squabbles over trade and defense spending, Sebastien Cochard, a member of the National Rally party in France, told Sputnik. "The G7 discussions were just another blow to the transatlantic alliance. The explicit US threats of secondary sanctions on EU companies in commercial relations with Iran or Russia were already a big thing," Cochard said. Washington's insistence that all NATO members should spend the required 2 percent of their GDP on defense is another sore point, according to Cochard.

"In the past, you saw European countries that did not dare to condemn the US. That time is over, yet the disagreements within the EU are high when it comes to the future and our economic ties with China or Russia," Vos said. Start Negotiating The Europeans should begin serious negotiations with Trump based on the "protected exchange" model rather than unrestrained free trade, Prof. Gilles Lebreton, a French member of the Europe of Nations and Freedom Group (ENF) at the European Parliament, said. "Europeans should begin to negotiate seriously with Trump on the basis of the new "protected exchange" model, rather than cling to their dogma of unbridled free trade. [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel will probably understand it sooner than [French President Emmanuel] Macron (too dogmatic) because she has a good handle on German interests," Lebreton told Sputnik. Germany is not likely to respond to Trump's tariffs out of fear to hurt its own car exports, Cochard noted. "I do not expect any retaliatory move, as Germany is too scared to be submitted to subsequent retaliation from the US. Germany is in particular scared to see its precious car exports submitted to tariffs by the US. Such an action from the US would compromise German's economic export-oriented model," the French politician said.

"Given the trade imbalance between the US and the EU, Mr. Trump is absolutely right to take measures. The EU is a failed project. The European Commission has no position at all to lecture Mr. Trump. The UK should disembark from this sinking ship as soon as possible and join the winning team," de Graaf told Sputnik. Return to G8 Trump went against the grain in urging for the return to G8, a format that included G7 states and Russia. The reactions of other G7 members varied: Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte backed the call for the G8 restoration. Trudeau dismissed the idea as something of little interest at the moment.

News article:
https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/12512/germany-russia-sanctions President Trump is taking flak for having introduced a subject to the G-7 meeting that our European friends wanted to keep under the table. Russia. The allies expressed horror when Mr. Trump said, “Why are we having a meeting without Russia? We have a world to run… We should have Russia at the negotiating table.” Aside from the hyperbole over who actually runs the world, his comment and the allied response are only shocking if one thinks the Europeans have been boycotting Russia. There are sanctions on Moscow since it illegally invaded and seized Ukraine and Crimea, but sanctions are one thing and trade is another. Germany leads the pack in trade with Russia. This may have something to do with the fact that Germany, in particular but not only, stays warm in the winter with Russian natural gas meeting about 40% of its requirements. This is an old story. The Reagan administration objected to Russian-European plans to build the natural gas Yamal Pipeline from Siberia to Germany from which gas would be distributed to much of Western Europe. The American position was that, In the middle of the Cold War, having the USSR control a majority of the supply of natural gas to Germany’s industrial heartland would make it difficult for Germany to resist Russian political and military demands. But the Europeans wanted to sell Russia the machinery for the pipeline, making money as they mortgaged their energy future to Moscow. After a bitter fight, the Yamal pipeline was partially blocked and only one strand of two was built. Post-Soviet, the Russians were able, with European support, to build the second strand. In the early 2000’s Europe bought into yet another Russian-originated pipeline — an undersea project called Nord Stream — again providing manufacturing jobs and pipeline work for Europe as well as gas. Early in 2018, Bloomberg reported, “Russia, which shipped some $38 billion of gas to its most lucrative markets in Europe last year, has diminished thoughts that other suppliers could ensure supplies in Europe anytime soon.” Nord Stream, and its successor Nord Stream 2, will give Russia the same influence its predecessor, the USSR, would have had. Russia is now a fine partner for Europe. The Vice President of the Bundestag Thomas Opperman said, “Nord Stream 2 is an important economic project, which we support and it should not be threatened by sanctions from third countries.” Mrs. Merkel would agree, no doubt, not only for the warmth, but because the pipeline will enter Germany at Greifswald in the old East Germany, part of her constituency. The underwater Nord Stream 2 will reduce the price of natural gas by about 40% compared to overland pipelines, benefitting Germany, the UK, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands — among the countries most outspoken about the invasion of Ukraine. But to make Nord Stream 2 work, Gazprom has to get out of old contracts with Ukraine and Poland. Gazprom is presently suing Ukraine in the international arbitration court in Stockholm to cancel both its gas supply and transit contracts, stiffing Kiev. Ukraine won the first round, but Russia appealed. In the wake of the Ukrainian victory, the EU offered to “mediate” between the two. Mediate away a favorable judgment for Ukraine? Isn’t this whole Russia-boycott project about Putin’s interference in Ukraine’s march to democracy? Talk about collusion. So, now that we are clear on Germany and the EU’s interest in maintaining economic ties with Russia, consider why they are pretending to keep Putin out in the hallway. Russia, they say, is out because of its horrendous behavior in Ukraine, but — while no additional sanctions have been imposed for Russian support for the Syrian war criminal regime of Bashar Assad (which may make Moscow complicit in war crimes) — Syria is on European minds. Germany, in particular, has had harsh words for Russia over its veto of 12 UN Security Council Resolutions on Syria. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters, “We can’t go on like this… So, we’re keeping up the political pressure on Russia and we’d like to increase it further. Getting Russia to change its behavior is a condition for solving the Syria conflict.” Germany has backed allied air strikes on Syria as “necessary and appropriate.” While claiming to be appalled by Russia’s behavior in Syria, however, Germany continues to push trade not only with Russia, but with Russia’s partner in the Syrian genocide, Iran. European firms raced to enter Iran under the terms of the 2015 JCPOA; American firms were less aggressive. But since the U.S. has withdrawn from the never-signed deal, major European companies have been winding down or winding up operations in Iran. At the same time, though, the EU has begun to update its ” blocking statute,” the most powerful response it has to prevent European companies from complying with impending Iran sanctions. In what Mrs. Merkel has said is a bid to “protect European companies” in Iran, the statute will nullify in Europe punishment the U.S. imposes for sanctions violations and allows EU companies to sue for damages caused by leaving Iran for fear of U.S. sanctions. So, the EU will use its leverage to keep companies in a country, Iran, that hangs gay people from cranes in the street, holds American hostages, threatens democratic Israel with annihilation, participates fully in the Syrian genocide, and actively seeks nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology. And as Iran seeks military technology, Germany obliges. In 2016, with government permission, the German company Krempel sold electronic press boards to Iranian companies. The German newspaper Bild reported that Krempel parts were discovered at the site of a Syrian government chemical attack on its civilian population. The Jerusalem Post said the technology was used in the rockets that delivered the chemicals . Krempel didn’t deny it, telling Bild the company was “shocked” to find its product in Syria. A 2018 German intelligence report confirms that Iran is currently seeking nuclear technology in Germany. Since the 2015 JCPOA, Germany, has been Iran’s largest European trading partner: 2.9 billion euros in 2016 according to the German government and 3.6 billion euros in 2017. Interestingly, the trade goes only one way: in 2016, Germany exported 2.6 billion euros worth to Iran and took back only 300 million euros. According to Deutsche Welle, Germany imports dried fruits, pistachios, rugs and industrial raw materials from Iran and sends machinery and equipment, cars, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and medical products, and takes back Chemicals, machinery, industrial raw materials for Iran’s mullahs. What could go wrong? In sum, then, President Trump’s faux pas appears to be having the temerity to suggest that Russia — a key German trading partner — have a place at the table for international trade talks. Perhaps it would be better to leave the hypocritical Germany out in the hallway.

So, the EU will use its leverage to keep companies in a country, Iran, that hangs gay people from cranes in the street, holds American hostages, threatens democratic Israel with annihilation, participates fully in the Syrian genocide, and actively seeks nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology. And as Iran seeks military technology, Germany obliges. In 2016, with government permission, the German company Krempel sold electronic press boards to Iranian companies. The German newspaper Bild reported that Krempel parts were discovered at the site of a Syrian government chemical attack on its civilian population. The Jerusalem Post said the technology was used in the rockets that delivered the chemicals . Krempel didn’t deny it, telling Bild the company was “shocked” to find its product in Syria. A 2018 German intelligence report confirms that Iran is currently seeking nuclear technology in Germany. Since the 2015 JCPOA, Germany, has been Iran’s largest European trading partner: 2.9 billion euros in 2016 according to the German government and 3.6 billion euros in 2017. Interestingly, the trade goes only one way: in 2016, Germany exported 2.6 billion euros worth to Iran and took back only 300 million euros. According to Deutsche Welle, Germany imports dried fruits, pistachios, rugs and industrial raw materials from Iran and sends machinery and equipment, cars, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and medical products, and takes back Chemicals, machinery, industrial raw materials for Iran’s mullahs. What could go wrong? In sum, then, President Trump’s faux pas appears to be having the temerity to suggest that Russia — a key German trading partner — have a place at the table for international trade talks. Perhaps it would be better to leave the hypocritical Germany out in the hallway.

News article:
https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/12512/germany-russia-sanctions President Trump is taking flak for having introduced a subject to the G-7 meeting that our European friends wanted to keep under the table. Russia. The allies expressed horror when Mr. Trump said, “Why are we having a meeting without Russia? We have a world to run… We should have Russia at the negotiating table.” Aside from the hyperbole over who actually runs the world, his comment and the allied response are only shocking if one thinks the Europeans have been boycotting Russia. There are sanctions on Moscow since it illegally invaded and seized Ukraine and Crimea, but sanctions are one thing and trade is another. Germany leads the pack in trade with Russia. This may have something to do with the fact that Germany, in particular but not only, stays warm in the winter with Russian natural gas meeting about 40% of its requirements. This is an old story. The Reagan administration objected to Russian-European plans to build the natural gas Yamal Pipeline from Siberia to Germany from which gas would be distributed to much of Western Europe. The American position was that, In the middle of the Cold War, having the USSR control a majority of the supply of natural gas to Germany’s industrial heartland would make it difficult for Germany to resist Russian political and military demands. But the Europeans wanted to sell Russia the machinery for the pipeline, making money as they mortgaged their energy future to Moscow. After a bitter fight, the Yamal pipeline was partially blocked and only one strand of two was built. Post-Soviet, the Russians were able, with European support, to build the second strand. In the early 2000’s Europe bought into yet another Russian-originated pipeline — an undersea project called Nord Stream — again providing manufacturing jobs and pipeline work for Europe as well as gas. Early in 2018, Bloomberg reported, “Russia, which shipped some $38 billion of gas to its most lucrative markets in Europe last year, has diminished thoughts that other suppliers could ensure supplies in Europe anytime soon.” Nord Stream, and its successor Nord Stream 2, will give Russia the same influence its predecessor, the USSR, would have had. Russia is now a fine partner for Europe. The Vice President of the Bundestag Thomas Opperman said, “Nord Stream 2 is an important economic project, which we support and it should not be threatened by sanctions from third countries.” Mrs. Merkel would agree, no doubt, not only for the warmth, but because the pipeline will enter Germany at Greifswald in the old East Germany, part of her constituency. The underwater Nord Stream 2 will reduce the price of natural gas by about 40% compared to overland pipelines, benefitting Germany, the UK, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands — among the countries most outspoken about the invasion of Ukraine. But to make Nord Stream 2 work, Gazprom has to get out of old contracts with Ukraine and Poland. Gazprom is presently suing Ukraine in the international arbitration court in Stockholm to cancel both its gas supply and transit contracts, stiffing Kiev. Ukraine won the first round, but Russia appealed. In the wake of the Ukrainian victory, the EU offered to “mediate” between the two. Mediate away a favorable judgment for Ukraine? Isn’t this whole Russia-boycott project about Putin’s interference in Ukraine’s march to democracy? Talk about collusion. So, now that we are clear on Germany and the EU’s interest in maintaining economic ties with Russia, consider why they are pretending to keep Putin out in the hallway. Russia, they say, is out because of its horrendous behavior in Ukraine, but — while no additional sanctions have been imposed for Russian support for the Syrian war criminal regime of Bashar Assad (which may make Moscow complicit in war crimes) — Syria is on European minds. Germany, in particular, has had harsh words for Russia over its veto of 12 UN Security Council Resolutions on Syria. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters, “We can’t go on like this… So, we’re keeping up the political pressure on Russia and we’d like to increase it further. Getting Russia to change its behavior is a condition for solving the Syria conflict.” Germany has backed allied air strikes on Syria as “necessary and appropriate.” While claiming to be appalled by Russia’s behavior in Syria, however, Germany continues to push trade not only with Russia, but with Russia’s partner in the Syrian genocide, Iran. European firms raced to enter Iran under the terms of the 2015 JCPOA; American firms were less aggressive. But since the U.S. has withdrawn from the never-signed deal, major European companies have been winding down or winding up operations in Iran. At the same time, though, the EU has begun to update its ” blocking statute,” the most powerful response it has to prevent European companies from complying with impending Iran sanctions. In what Mrs. Merkel has said is a bid to “protect European companies” in Iran, the statute will nullify in Europe punishment the U.S. imposes for sanctions violations and allows EU companies to sue for damages caused by leaving Iran for fear of U.S. sanctions. So, the EU will use its leverage to keep companies in a country, Iran, that hangs gay people from cranes in the street, holds American hostages, threatens democratic Israel with annihilation, participates fully in the Syrian genocide, and actively seeks nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology.

News article:
The head of NATO has warned that splits between the U.S. and its European allies risk endangering the trans-Atlantic security alliance. In an editorial in The Guardian, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg writes that "the ties that bind us are under strain." He said: "We must continue to work hard to settle our differences—and where differences persist, we must limit any negative impact on our security cooperation." Stoltenberg's warning follows attacks on German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday by President Donald Trump, who criticized Germany over its immigration policy and taunted Merkel over a cabinet crisis that threatens her leadership. Trump tweeted Monday that Germans are "turning against their leadership" over immigration and falsely claimed that immigrants had caused a spike in crime rates. Stoltenberg's message comes less than a month before NATO leaders are set to meet in Brussels. In the article, he enumerated deep divisions between the U.S. and Europe, but he expressed his belief that NATO leaders could overcome their differences and the alliance could endure. "Since the alliance was created almost 70 years ago, the people of Europe and North America have enjoyed an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity. But, at the political level, the ties which bind us are under strain. "There are real differences between the United States and other allies over issues such as trade, climate change and the Iran nuclear agreement. "These disagreements are real and they won't disappear overnight. In fact, nowhere is it written in stone that the transatlantic bond will always thrive. That doesn't, however, mean that its breakdown is inevitable. We can maintain it, and all the mutual benefits we derive from it." Trump's attacks on Europe came as he faces fierce domestic criticism over his administration's policy of separating immigrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexican border and holding them in mass detention centers. Trump also clashed with Europe after pulling out of the Paris climate deal in the first year of his presidency, and in May after withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal. He has also castigated European nations for failing to meet their NATO military spending commitments, and for what he claims are unfair trade practices.

News article:
* U.S. official seeks to explain Trump's actions in speech * Europeans deeply concerned by withdrawal from Iran deal By Robin Emmott BRUSSELS, June 21 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's tough stance on Iran, new tariffs on European Union metal imports and U.S. demands for higher defence spending in Europe are part of a strategy to strengthen the West, a senior U.S. official said on Thursday. Wess Mitchell, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, said that without such actions, U.S. and European diplomatic and military leadership would be overtaken by China, Russia and Iran. "Taking strong positions on these issues may not always lead to immediate agreement. But the long term costs of neglecting these things far outweigh political unity," Mitchell told European and NATO officials, in a rare speech by a Trump administration official in Brussels. European leaders are deeply worried by Trump's foreign policy and his "America first" rhetoric, while his May 8 decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal undermined an agreement prized by Europeans. A Group of Seven summit in Canada earlier this month laid bare tensions between NATO allies after Trump's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the European Union and Canada on national security grounds. Mitchell, who studied in Berlin and speaks German, sought to place Trump's decisions into a coherent policy plan that would benefit European countries because Trump was acting decisively to bring change, rather than relying on endless negotiations. "In all of these areas, with Iran, defence spending, trade, we are committed to finding a common way forward, we are committing to acting. We can debate, we can strategise, we can coordinate, but we must act," he said. "In the actions we take, we are hoping to spur a multilateral response to address some of the world's toughest challenges," Mitchell said at the Carnegie Europe think-tank gathering in Brussels. Mitchell said U.S. import tariffs on European goods would end "structural trade imbalances and predatory trade practices" in U.S.-EU trade, which would weaken the West if they continue. Reimposing sanctions on Iran by withdrawing from the Iran nuclear accord would help stop Tehran's missile programme and limit the regional reach of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, he said. Mitchell also repeated Trump's central message to NATO that European allies must spend 2 percent of economic output a year on defence to rebuild "atrophied European militaries." Trump is expected at a NATO summit in Brussels in July, a year since he first came to the alliance and publicly admonished allies for not spending enough on defence. Many EU and NATO diplomats now view the U.S. president as an unknown quantity with a lack of interest in the transatlantic ties that Europe and Canada cherish, and who is unnecessarily stoking a global trade war that will hurt economic growth.

But the long term costs of neglecting these things far outweigh political unity," Mitchell told European and NATO officials, in a rare speech by a Trump administration official in Brussels. European leaders are deeply worried by Trump's foreign policy and his "America first" rhetoric, while his May 8 decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal undermined an agreement prized by Europeans. A Group of Seven summit in Canada earlier this month laid bare tensions between NATO allies after Trump's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the European Union and Canada on national security grounds. Mitchell, who studied in Berlin and speaks German, sought to place Trump's decisions into a coherent policy plan that would benefit European countries because Trump was acting decisively to bring change, rather than relying on endless negotiations. "In all of these areas, with Iran, defence spending, trade, we are committed to finding a common way forward, we are committing to acting. We can debate, we can strategise, we can coordinate, but we must act," he said. "In the actions we take, we are hoping to spur a multilateral response to address some of the world's toughest challenges," Mitchell said at the Carnegie Europe think-tank gathering in Brussels. Mitchell said U.S. import tariffs on European goods would end "structural trade imbalances and predatory trade practices" in U.S.-EU trade, which would weaken the West if they continue. Reimposing sanctions on Iran by withdrawing from the Iran nuclear accord would help stop Tehran's missile programme and limit the regional reach of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, he said. Mitchell also repeated Trump's central message to NATO that European allies must spend 2 percent of economic output a year on defence to rebuild "atrophied European militaries." Trump is expected at a NATO summit in Brussels in July, a year since he first came to the alliance and publicly admonished allies for not spending enough on defence. Many EU and NATO diplomats now view the U.S. president as an unknown quantity with a lack of interest in the transatlantic ties that Europe and Canada cherish, and who is unnecessarily stoking a global trade war that will hurt economic growth.

* U.S. official seeks to explain Trump's actions in speech * Europeans deeply concerned by withdrawal from Iran deal By Robin Emmott BRUSSELS, June 21 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's tough stance on Iran, new tariffs on European Union metal imports and U.S. demands for higher defence spending in Europe are part of a strategy to strengthen the West, a senior U.S. official said on Thursday.

Europe seeks to pin down President Trump – and America Caroline Glick http://carolineglick.com/europe-seeks-to-pin-down-president-trump-and-america/ National Security Advisor John Bolton said last Wednesday that while discussion of President Donald Trump’s decision to leave the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has centered on the administration’s revulsion with its institutional anti-Israel bias, the move was really about restoring American control over U.S. foreign policy. In his words: “We did talk about Israel [in setting out our reasons for leaving the UNHRC] because it’s singled out unfairly. But in many respects, Israel is, as the saying goes, ‘the canary in the mine shaft’ for the United States. Countries that attack Israel do so because they think it’s easier, but much of their criticism is really aimed at us.” Bolton added, “Getting off of the council is an assertion of America’s determination to stick to its Constitution and not to recognize that there’s some ‘higher authority’ at the UN … to judge our performance or to give us advice on how to implement the constitution … That’s what this is about: self-government.” The Trump administration’s determination to restore American power and independence in the international arena places it on a collision course with the European Union, whose perspective on the proper goal of international affairs is diametrically opposed to the administration’s. American power abroad rests on military and economic power. Since the end of the Second World War, Europe has been militarily dependent on the U.S. Rather than build their own military power to secure their interests and enable them to play a leading role in world affairs, European leaders have based their international position on their power as a voting bloc in international and transnational institutions, and on their collective financial power. Since the mid-1970s, Europe has used its power in international institutions and its financial power to advance one consistent policy position: hostility towards Israel. The UNHRC is a perfect vehicle for advancing Europe’s foreign policy. Its name gives it a do-gooder halo effect. The notion that a “human rights council” could be anything but a force for good in the world is hard to accept. But a year after it was established, the council focused its efforts not on protecting human rights, but on attacking the human rights of Jews in Israel. In 2007, the UNHRC passed Permanent Agenda Item 7. Item 7 created a separate standard for judging the Jewish state. Under Item 7, Israel is automatically subjected to condemnation for every action it takes to defend itself. Under Item 7, the council automatically embraces every Palestinian libel against Israel. To get a sense of how this agenda item has perverted the council, from 2006-2016, the council passed 135 resolutions in total. 68 were condemnations of Israel. Syria was condemned 20 times, North Korea nine, and Iran six. In her remarks Tuesday explaining America’s decision to leave the UNHRC, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley expressed frustration at the fact that Europe had refused to assist in the U.S.’s efforts to reform the UNHRC by, among other things, cancelling Agenda Item 7. In her words: There are several countries on the Human Rights Council who do share our values. Many of them strongly urged us to remain engaged in the council. They are embarrassed by the obsessive mistreatment of Israel. … Ultimately, many of these likeminded countries were unwilling to seriously challenge the status quo. We gave them opportunity after opportunity and many months of consultations, and yet they would not take a stand unless it was behind closed doors. Some even admittedly were fine with the blatant flaws of the council as long as they could pursue their own narrow agenda within the current structure. Haley attributed their refusal to help to cowardice – or what she called “moral compromise.” Haley’s explanation for Europe’s refusal to work with the U.S. on what she thought was a common goal of ending the UNHRC’s anti-Semitism was reasonable, but wrong. And her mistake was understandable. The EU and its member nations go to great lengths to hide the fact that they are on the opposite side of the fence from the U.S. in regards to Israel specifically and the issue of nationalism and U.S. independence more broadly. The day before Haley and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the U.S. withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council, British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson addressed the body. His speech was a case study in how this double game works. Johnson began his address by offering fulsome praise for the UNHRC. Johnson said, “Britain considers this Council to be part of the rules-based international system in which we believe and that we strive to protect.: He then proceeded to pay lip service to America’s opposition to the council’s institutional bias against Israel. “I will say that we share the [U.S.] view that a dedicated agenda item focused solely on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories is disproportionate and damaging to the cause of peace and unless things change, we shall move next year to vote against all resolutions introduced under Item 7.” Then he went back to roundly praising the council. “But I stress that that does not mean that we in the UK are blind to the value of this Council – including the work it could do on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict under the right agenda item – and we support its emphasis on freedom of religion and expression and the empowerment of women.” Johnson devoted the rest of his remarks to an impassioned call for universal K-12 education for girls worldwide as a means to “solve the majority of the world’s most serious problems.” Three things stand out in Johnson’s speech. First, while he said that Britain supports a “rules-based international system,” he effectively endorsed the destruction of all rules in the international system. Permanent Agenda Item 7 created a set of rules that it applies only to Israel. Under the rules it set up, Israel is always guilty of abusing human rights. By setting up a system of rules it applies only to the Jewish state, Item 7 abolished the entire notion of international law. After all, if there is one law for Jews, and another law for everyone else, then there is no rule of law at all. If his statement about Britain’s commitment to the “rules-based international system,” were serious, then Britain would have withdrawn from the council with the U.S. By remaining in, and praising, the UNHRC, Johnson made clear that Britain couldn’t care less about a “rules-based international system.” The second thing that stands out in his speech is the disingenuousness of his opposition to Item 7. Johnson said that the UK opposes Item 7 because it is “disproportionate and damaging to the cause of peace.” Let us leave aside the fact that Item 7 scuppers the entire system of international law and judge Johnson’s credibility within the limited scope of his statement. Johnson said that due to the “disproportionate” character of anti-Israel resolutions, Britain will stop voting in favor of those drafted in the framework of Item 7 in six months. Why the long wait? If Britain really views Item 7 as damaging to the cause of peace, then in the interest of peace Britain must oppose all Item 7 resolutions effective yesterday. The six-month waiting period tells us that Britain is not serious about peace, and that it is not at all upset with the fact that Item 7 is “disproportionate” (whatever that means). The final notable aspect of Johnson’s speech was his ode to universal female education. Johnson’s impassioned cri de coeur speech was remarkable for its irrelevance. True, educating girls would have a positive impact on many of the world’s major problems. But the UNHRC has about as much power to bring about K-12 education for the girls of Nigeria and Yemen as Micronesia has of dictating world oil prices. Apparently, in presenting his pie-in-the-sky plan, Johnson was advocating on behalf of what Haley referred to as a “narrow agenda,” which he apparently believes is so important it justifies remaining in an institutionally anti-Semitic body. In short, Johnson pretended to side with the U.S in its opposition to the UNHRC’s antisemitism while he substantively endorsed that antisemitism. Finally, Johnson pretended that Britain cares about human rights with his plea for universal K-12 education for girls. But actually, he was just bloviating. Three days before he made his manipulative speech, Israel’s Channel 10 reported that Johnson is trying to organize a meeting of European and Arab foreign ministers with Trump’s senior advisor Jared Kushner, who is leading the U.S. team forming a new U.S. plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The meeting is tentatively scheduled for July. It is supposed to serve as an opportunity for the Europeans and the Arabs to present their “red lines” for peace. In light of Europe’s institutional hostility towards Israel, and given the collective Arab rejection of Israel’s right to exist, it is obvious that Johnson doesn’t want this meeting because he is keen to advance the cause of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. He is working to set up a meeting where the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan gang up on the U.S. and tell the President’s son-in-law that they will not accept any plan that doesn’t reflect their animus towards Israel. Kushner, for his part, reportedly responded to Johnson’s attempt to railroad the White House into giving the EU veto power over U.S. Middle East policy by saying that while he is open to outside input in the U.S. peace plan, the President will decide its contents. Kushner’s response hit the proper note. But it bears pointing out that Johnson’s speech at the UNHRC, like his attempt to build a coalition to ensnare the White House in a Middle East policy predicated on hostility towards Israel, show that Europe’s refusal to back the U.S.’s positions at the UNHRC was not a simple disagreement about the best way to achieve common ends. Rather, Johnson’s efforts reveal a much more basic and unbridgeable conflict between the U.S. and Europe about the proper ends of foreign policy, and the sovereign right of the U.S. to advance its goals in the international arena.

The final notable aspect of Johnson’s speech was his ode to universal female education. Johnson’s impassioned cri de coeur speech was remarkable for its irrelevance. True, educating girls would have a positive impact on many of the world’s major problems. But the UNHRC has about as much power to bring about K-12 education for the girls of Nigeria and Yemen as Micronesia has of dictating world oil prices. Apparently, in presenting his pie-in-the-sky plan, Johnson was advocating on behalf of what Haley referred to as a “narrow agenda,” which he apparently believes is so important it justifies remaining in an institutionally anti-Semitic body. In short, Johnson pretended to side with the U.S in its opposition to the UNHRC’s antisemitism while he substantively endorsed that antisemitism. Finally, Johnson pretended that Britain cares about human rights with his plea for universal K-12 education for girls. But actually, he was just bloviating. Three days before he made his manipulative speech, Israel’s Channel 10 reported that Johnson is trying to organize a meeting of European and Arab foreign ministers with Trump’s senior advisor Jared Kushner, who is leading the U.S. team forming a new U.S. plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The meeting is tentatively scheduled for July. It is supposed to serve as an opportunity for the Europeans and the Arabs to present their “red lines” for peace. In light of Europe’s institutional hostility towards Israel, and given the collective Arab rejection of Israel’s right to exist, it is obvious that Johnson doesn’t want this meeting because he is keen to advance the cause of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. He is working to set up a meeting where the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan gang up on the U.S. and tell the President’s son-in-law that they will not accept any plan that doesn’t reflect their animus towards Israel. Kushner, for his part, reportedly responded to Johnson’s attempt to railroad the White House into giving the EU veto power over U.S. Middle East policy by saying that while he is open to outside input in the U.S. peace plan, the President will decide its contents. Kushner’s response hit the proper note. But it bears pointing out that Johnson’s speech at the UNHRC, like his attempt to build a coalition to ensnare the White House in a Middle East policy predicated on hostility towards Israel, show that Europe’s refusal to back the U.S.’s positions at the UNHRC was not a simple disagreement about the best way to achieve common ends. Rather, Johnson’s efforts reveal a much more basic and unbridgeable conflict between the U.S. and Europe about the proper ends of foreign policy, and the sovereign right of the U.S. to advance its goals in the international arena.

News article:
Topic: Security Region: Americas Tags: NATOAlliancesAlliesNational SecurityDonald Trump Alliances allow America to effectively restrain its allies from large conflicts. Recently, following a meeting with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) G7, United States President Donald Trump used Twitter to express his frustrations with the European alliance network. The president noted that the United States pays “close to the entire cost of NATO— protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on trade.” He also said that “Germany pays 1% (slowly) of GDP towards NATO, while we pay 4% of a MUCH larger GDP.” In these tweets, Trump echoes two large myths about America’s alliance system. These myths are that NATO allies free ride off the United States and that American allies provide little-to-no security benefit. The idea that European allies free ride off U.S. security spending is long-standing. George Kennan posited that a united Europe would effectively balance against the Soviet Union, but politicians are less trusting. Dwight Eisenhower frequently lamented that European allies were not spending enough for their defense. Furthermore, historical documents show that, when England cut its defense spending in the mid-1960s, the Johnson administration was noticeably frustrated. Moreover, according to Pew Research Center’s surveys conducted since the end of the Cold War, most Americans support NATO, but a large proportion believes Washington’s policymakers spend too much money helping the organization. In other words, Americans think that NATO allies are paying their “fair share” on defense, and thereby take advantage of U.S. security spending. Consequently, there is broad acceptance regarding the myth of a free riding NATO. The problem is that this myth ignores Kennan’s still-standing Cold War logic. For Kennan, the central idea of NATO was to de-securitize Western European states and, paradoxically, strengthen European security. This meant that by reducing the Europeans’ state-led processes of increasing power, European states would focus on “collective security” instead of just their own. Such a plan was compelling because, after World War II, European states faced a threat from communism and the Soviet Union. Accordingly, they were willing to avoid things like building nuclear weapons so that they could join Washington’s “security umbrella.” Furthermore, this increased European collective security. Additionally, for the United States, this reduced the likelihood of war between its European allies and provided a way to balance against the Soviet Union. In the present, while there is no Soviet threat, avoiding a European security dilemma is advantageous for Washington. G. John Ikenberry’s book After Victory examines the history of “world order.” He finds that liberal, rules-based orders—like that established by the United States after World War II—last longer and are significantly more peaceful than both hegemonic rule and “balance of power” systems. Two of the most critical contemporary threats to the rules-based order is Russia’s and China’s rising power and their expanding interests throughout Europe. NATO serves to counteract those threats, and in doing so, maintains the international system’s stability. Therefore, retrenching from Europe is another grave threat facing the U.S.-led international order, and one Trump should take seriously. The second myth that Trump’s statements feed is that United States’ alliances provide minimal benefits. Individuals who agree with this argue that Washington’s commitments to its friends both limit America’s ability to establish its supremacy and entrap it into conflict because of contractual obligations. Consequently, by retrenching from formal defense pacts, the United States could elongate its unipolar status. Inverting this logic, however, shows the reality of the situation. First, allies limiting American primacy is a net benefit. Frankly, reducing the amount of war and conflict is inherently advantageous, and can preserve U.S. economic and military strength. In his 2015 article, “The Myth of Entangling Alliances,” Michael Beckley argues that U.S. defense pacts reduce the risks of conflict. This is because, by having many allies across the world, America faces conflicting commitments and needs to restrain itself militarily so that it can satisfy these varying agreements. The offsetting obligations allow Washington to avoid unnecessary conflict. Thus, similar to investment portfolios, America’s significant number of alliances reduce the risk of future war. Furthermore, because of Washington’s dominant position in its alliance hierarchies, it can effectively restrain its allies from great conflicts. Smaller countries that do not want to increase their security risk will not engage in wars that their stronger allies wish to avoid. These small countries see a security benefit from great power alliances, and the former is subservient to the latter. For example, in Asia after World War II, Washington restrained South Korea from attacking North Korea and Taiwan from fighting China via threats to reduce American military and economic support. Moreover, the United States threatened to end its arms sales to Iran, thus forcing Tehran to avoid joining the 1973 oil embargo. Accordingly, America’s alliances provide it leverage that increases its immediate security and decrease global conflict. Overall, Trump and other critics fundamentally misunderstand the benefit to the U.S. alliance network. NATO and other allies serve to maintain the current rules-based international order, reduce Washington’s risk of war, and decrease levels of global conflict. Therefore, abandoning U.S. allies under the guise of “America first” would harm American security, and just mean “America alone.” Jordan Cohen is a Political Science Ph.D. student at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government.

News article:
Ahead of the Brussels summit, the U.S. President Donald Trump lambasted the leaders of NATO allies in harsh letters, warning that the U.S. is losing patience with their failure to meet security obligations within the alliance, widening the rift between its European allies. Trump has repeatedly criticized NATO allies for failing to meet a 2014 commitment to spend two percent of GDP on defense by 2024, accusing them of leaving the U.S. to shoulder an unfair burden for defending Europe. Currently, the U.S. accounts for nearly 72 percent of all defense spending in NATO and only three European countries hit the two percent GDP target, Britain, Greece and Estonia. He was reported saying during the G7 summit in Canada earlier this month that NATO is "as bad as NAFTA." However, Germany, which has had tense ties with the U.S. in recent months, has already indicated it will be unable to meet that goal. German defense spending is currently at 1.22 percent, according to the figures released by NATO. In response, the Trump administration has started evaluating the costs of transferring or withdrawing troops from Germany, where the United States has its biggest contingent outside the country, The Washington Post reported earlier. Among the options under consideration are rep atriating a large contingent of the approximately 35,000 active duty troops, or a full or partial move of the military personnel from Germany to Poland, according to the Post. Citing anonymous sources, the newspaper stressed that the study was only an internal examination of options at this stage. "Continued German underspending on defense undermines the security of the alliance and provides validation for other allies that also do not plan to meet their military spending commitments, because others see you as a role model," Trump said in an individual letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, The New York Times reported. Trump's move came after he rattled his G7 allies with blistering rhetoric about their trading relationships with the United States and a series of scathing remarks about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum in response to what he calls unfair trade practices from Europe, Canada, and other allies around the world, who have responded with retaliatory sanctions in kind. Trump has been complaining about the unfair treatment of international organizations and multilateral agreements. First he withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal three days after his inauguration last January and then wanted NAFTA to be renegotiated. Now, U.S. membership to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is under question as it could greatly hurt global trade, widening the rift between its European allies. His decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal was another important factor for the deteriorating ties between the U.S. and its European allies. Trump piled pressure on close allies with a threat to sanction European companies that do business with Iran.

First he withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal three days after his inauguration last January and then wanted NAFTA to be renegotiated. Now, U.S. membership to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is under question as it could greatly hurt global trade, widening the rift between its European allies. His decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal was another important factor for the deteriorating ties between the U.S. and its European allies. Trump piled pressure on close allies with a threat to sanction European companies that do business with Iran.

News article:
Ahead of the Brussels summit, the U.S. President Donald Trump lambasted the leaders of NATO allies in harsh letters, warning that the U.S. is losing patience with their failure to meet security obligations within the alliance, widening the rift between its European allies. Trump has repeatedly criticized NATO allies for failing to meet a 2014 commitment to spend two percent of GDP on defense by 2024, accusing them of leaving the U.S. to shoulder an unfair burden for defending Europe. Currently, the U.S. accounts for nearly 72 percent of all defense spending in NATO and only three European countries hit the two percent GDP target, Britain, Greece and Estonia. He was reported saying during the G7 summit in Canada earlier this month that NATO is "as bad as NAFTA." However, Germany, which has had tense ties with the U.S. in recent months, has already indicated it will be unable to meet that goal. German defense spending is currently at 1.22 percent, according to the figures released by NATO. In response, the Trump administration has started evaluating the costs of transferring or withdrawing troops from Germany, where the United States has its biggest contingent outside the country, The Washington Post reported earlier. Among the options under consideration are rep atriating a large contingent of the approximately 35,000 active duty troops, or a full or partial move of the military personnel from Germany to Poland, according to the Post. Citing anonymous sources, the newspaper stressed that the study was only an internal examination of options at this stage. "Continued German underspending on defense undermines the security of the alliance and provides validation for other allies that also do not plan to meet their military spending commitments, because others see you as a role model," Trump said in an individual letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, The New York Times reported. Trump's move came after he rattled his G7 allies with blistering rhetoric about their trading relationships with the United States and a series of scathing remarks about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum in response to what he calls unfair trade practices from Europe, Canada, and other allies around the world, who have responded with retaliatory sanctions in kind. Trump has been complaining about the unfair treatment of international organizations and multilateral agreements. First he withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal three days after his inauguration last January and then wanted NAFTA to be renegotiated.

News article:
HAPPENING TODAY: Mattis is scheduled to have lunch today with Trump at the White House. The Pentagon says Mattis, who is just back from his trip to China, as well as consultations with allies South Korea and Japan, is said to have basically cleared his schedule to prepare for the NATO summit July 11-12. Tonight, Trump delivers remarks at the Salute to Service dinner in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. POMPEO TO PYONGYANG: The White House yesterday confirmed reports from last week that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will leave for North Korea on Thursday for a meeting with Kim Jong Un and his “team.” Pompeo will be seeking specific commitments and timetables for North Korea to show it’s serious about meeting a vague commitment it made last month in Singapore “to work towards complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” The White House yesterday refused to confirm widely reported U.S. intelligence assessments that the North was preparing to conceal the extent of its nuclear arsenal and related programs. “We aren’t going to confirm or deny any intelligence reports,” said press secretary Sarah Sanders. “What I can tell you is that we’re continuing to make progress. In the last eight months, you haven’t seen missile launches. You haven’t seen nuclear detonations. And again, these conversations are continuing to evolve.” Pompeo plans to wrap up his talks in Pyongyang in time to joint Trump and Mattis at the NATO summit in Brussels. BEIJING BRUSH OFF: Meanwhile, China is dismissing those intel assessments, touting instead the “momentum” behind the denuclearization process. “I don’t know where they come from or on what basis those U.S. officials made the relevant comments,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said. “I think you may have to seek clarification from them.” THE ‘CODSPREY’ COMETH: U.S. troops and supplies will have a new way to arrive on aircraft carriers now that the Pentagon has inked a new $4 billion aircraft contract. The contract with Boeing and Bell Helicopter includes 39 of a new Navy variant of the Osprey aircraft, called the CMV-22B, that would land on the massive ship decks and act as a transport. The Marine Corps is set to get 34 of its own “B” variant Osprey aircraft and Japan will buy four under the contract. The carrier transport job is now handled by C-2A Greyhound turboprop aircraft that make catapult launches, harrowing dives and jarring arrested stops onto the carriers. Known as the carrier onboard delivery aircraft, or COD, the Greyhounds were introduced in the 1960s and have had a stellar safety record, despite last year’s emergency water landing in the Philippine Sea that claimed the lives of three crew members. But the CODs were notoriously hot, noisy and uncomfortable, with passengers strapped in backward and given only two small porthole windows. The new “Codsprey” CMV-22B tilt-rotor aircraft will have an enlarged fuel tank for longer range and be able to hover and land on the carriers like a helicopter. HIGH-POWERED ARMY LASER: It may be only a $10 million defense contract, but who doesn’t love laser weapons? Raytheon announced it won the contract to demonstrate a combat-strength 100-kilowatt laser to be mounted on Army trucks, specifically what the service calls its family of medium tactical vehicles. “This system is being designed to knock out rockets, artillery or mortar fire, or small drones,” Roy Azevedo, vice president of intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance systems with the Raytheon space and airborne systems business unit, said in a statement. NO IRAN WAIVERS FOR ALLIES? The United States will not hesitate to enforce sanctions on countries doing business with Iran despite deep concern among allies in Europe, the State Department said Monday. “We will not hesitate to take action when we see sanctionable activity and that is consistent with our policy of economic and diplomatic isolation of Iran,” said Brian Hook, the department’s director of policy planning. Waivers for the allies could undermine the Trump administration’s aim of curbing Tehran’s malign activities in the Middle East, Hook said. But he also hinted there might be some flexibility, saying that countries making an effort to reduce Iranian imports such as oil could be considered. CRIMEA NOT IN PLAY: The Kremlin says Russian President Vladimir Putin has no intention of discussing the status of Crimea, a region annexed from Ukraine in 2014, during his summit with Trump. “Crimea cannot and will never be on the agenda because Crimea is an integral part of Russia,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said yesterday. “We do not recognize Russia’s attempt to annex Crimea,” Sanders said at the White House yesterday. “We agree to disagree with Russia on that front, and our Crimea sanctions against Russia will remain in place until Russia returns the peninsula to the Ukraine.” TERROR LABEL: The Trump administration is considering designating Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a branch of Iran’s military, as a foreign terrorist organization, CNN reports. The move is controversial among senior Cabinet officials, as some caution it could jeopardize U.S. personnel and installations overseas. For example, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats warned that the new label could present challenges to U.S. forces. OPERATION ROUNDUP: The U.S. military says the operation to eradicate the remaining elements of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria is gaining momentum. In a release yesterday, Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve said the coalition and its partners have accelerated offensive activity against ISIS targets in both Iraq and Syria. “Since the May 1 start of Operation Roundup, Syrian Democratic Forces resumed major offensive operations in the Middle Euphrates River Valley,” the statement said. “Since then, the SDF has continued to gain ground through offensive operations coupled with precision Coalition strike support.” The coalition says ISIS morale is “sinking on the frontlines as privileged [ISIS] leaders increasingly abandon their own fighters on the battlefield, taking resources with them as they flee.” TAKING THE MEASURE OF MATTIS: Talk Radio News Pentagon correspondent Tom Squitieri spent some quality time with Mattis on his Asia trip last week, and had an interesting take on how Mattis approached the Chinese. “Mattis is a true soldier. He has fought and led others to victory. For all its strengths and paper prowess, the Chinese military is untested. It may train well yet that guarantees nothing,” Squitieri writes, observing it was Mattis’ legendary military career that was his “secret weapon” to get the Chinese to pay attention to what he said. “The Chinese also know all this about him. It is that war fighting experience, that battlefield success, that they value, that makes his words ones they were open to hearing. That permitted Mattis to press Chinese President Xi Jinping and other top leaders on China’s buildup of military bases on disputed islands in the South China Sea — even as Xi defiantly stated Beijing would not give up ‘an inch of sovereignty,’ according to Chinese media. Mattis did not blink. He pressed the issue of China’s broken promise not to militarize the islands in every meeting except that with the president. In the meeting with Xi, he played his straight flush of geography, history, experience, calmness, and steadfastness.” McMASTER’S NEXT ACT: Former national security adviser retired Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster has been named a visiting fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University, beginning Sept. 1. McMaster, who was fired by tweet in March by Trump, will also serve as a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business in management. “I am delighted to welcome H.R. McMaster back to the Stanford community,” said FSI Director Michael McFaul, in a statement. “In addition to his insights regarding national security strategy for the academic and policy worlds, we look forward to his contributions to the education and training of future foreign policy leaders from Stanford University.” THE RUNDOWN Bloomberg: Pentagon Hyped $1.2 Billion F-35 Savings Claim, Senators Say Defense News: US spy planes are breaking down ― and lawmakers want answers Stars and Stripes: Former Army Europe boss: Pulling US troops from Germany would be a big win for Russia Business Insider: Trump is trying to increase the pressure on Iran, but that means 'threading the needle' with a major ally Foreign Policy: The EU and NATO and Trump — Oh My!

President Donald Trump reportedly greeted German Chancellor Angela Merkel with a massive bill when she visited him soon after he entered the White House. Related: Watch: Angela Merkel looks unamused as Trump brags about saving money on Jerusalem embassy building "Angela, you owe me $1 trillion," Trump said, referring to the gulf between what Germany agreed to contribute to its defense under a NATO arrangement and what it actually spent over the previous 14 years, an official briefed on the meeting told The Wall Street Journal in a story published Sunday. Trump's brash remark to Merkel more than a year ago showcases his insistence that U.S. allies pay more for their defense—a stance he has maintained ahead of the NATO summit later this week. "The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country. This is not fair, nor is it acceptable," Trump tweeted Monday morning. "While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office, they must do much more. Germany is at 1%, the U.S. is at 4%." The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country. This is not fair, nor is it acceptable. While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office, they must do much more. Germany is at 1%, the U.S. is at 4%, and NATO benefits....... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2018 He continued by arguing that NATO benefits Europe "far more than it does the U.S." "By some accounts, the U.S. is paying for 90% of NATO, with many countries nowhere close to their 2% commitment," Trump tweeted. "On top of this the European Union has a Trade Surplus of $151 Million with the U.S., with big Trade Barriers on U.S. goods. NO!" Trump has complained about NATO since 2016 when he was on the campaign trail and said the U.S. could decline to meet its commitment to mutual defense because allies have not paid 2 percent of their gross domestic product, as agreed. Since his initial meeting with Merkel, the relationship between the two leaders has become only more tense. When Merkel visited the White House in April, Trump said, "Angela, you need to stop buying gas from Putin," referring to a Russia-Germany natural gas pipeline, according to an official at the meeting. Merkel responded that she wanted to broaden natural gas purchases and said she would try to convince members of the European Union to include this in trade talks. The divide between the two has often been painfully visible. The chancellor in April looked unamused during a joint press conference in which Trump boasted at length about how he had negotiated a lower price for the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. Germany is among several countries that urged the U.S. not to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. At the G-7 summit in Quebec last month, a photo went viral of Trump sitting with his arms crossed and smirking as Merkel stared him down. Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer said what happened next was Trump "stood up, he put his hand in his suit jacket pocket and he took two Starburst candies out, threw them on the table and said to Merkel, 'Here, Angela, don't say I never gave you anything.'"

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 complementary.

The image shows Donald Trump and Angela Merkel standing next to each other, looking at each other, and seemingly having a conversation. This is an event that could happen during any of the news events in the set. The image does not provide any specific information about the conversation, but it does provide a visual representation of the relationship between Trump and Merkel. The image is also a good example of how two people can have very different facial expressions while still having a conversation. Trump is smiling, while Merkel is looking more serious. This difference in facial expressions could be interpreted in many ways, but it is likely that it reflects the different personalities of the two leaders. Overall, the image is a good complement to the news events set, as it provides a visual representation of the relationship between Trump and Merkel.

News article:
by Xinhua writers Liu Chen, Guo Yina WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The current U.S.-Europe relations are at a "difficult" time with a looming trade war and lingering political disputes, said a U.S. expert on the trans-Atlantic ties. It's hard to predict their future right now, Frances Burwell, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council, a U.S. think tank, told Xinhua in an interview ahead of the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels. "A LOT MORE BARK THAN BITE" The United States' relations with Europe, its traditional closest ally, have been bumpy since President Donald Trump took office in 2017, as Washington kept lashing out at Europe's "unfair trade practices" amid their disagreements on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. Trump, in his first year of presidency, has already started to complain about imports of German cars and almost anywhere where the United States has a "trade imbalance," said Burwell. It was "a lot more bark than bite," the expert said. But now, "the bite is becoming as loud as the bark," Burwell noted. Recently, Trump has shaken up the world trading system by imposing tariffs on nearly all steel and aluminum imports for "national security reasons," including those from its European Union allies. Now Washington is considering doing the same for imports of automobiles. Linking the trade disputes to a "national security threat" is something that is "very difficult" for the Europeans to understand, Burwell, who once served as director of the Program on Transatlantic Relations at the Washington D.C.-based think tank, told Xinhua. The scholar warned that the disruption that the "bite" can cause should not be underestimated. She pointed out that the Europeans used to see Americans "as law-abiding, as trustworthy allies," a viewpoint she is not sure whether the Europeans are still holding. "We are now at a place where over the next couple of years ... we will see whether that public sympathy for us continues," the expert said. DIPLOMACY OR CAMPAIGN PROMISE For Burwell, the upcoming July 11-12 NATO summit in Brussels, which will gather leaders of the 29-nation security bloc, can be a chance for Trump to mend ties with the European allies. The defense spending is no doubt among the major topics for the summit. Trump has long been scolding those NATO countries which have not met the 2-percent-of-GDP benchmark. "I think most of the countries can make a very good case of that by 2024," the expert said. However, Burwell told Xinhua that what worried her most was the issues "that are not directly related to NATO," particularly "since the G7 (Group of Seven) summit ended as it did." Amid criticism from Germany and France, Trump unexpectedly withdrew his support for a G7 communique inked at a Canadian summit in early June, after calling Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau "very dishonest and weak." "If there is a revisiting of that and then that could be a challenge for the NATO summit," Burwell commented. For Burwell, Trump's understanding of U.S. foreign policy may not be of anything similar to his predecessors. "We need to understand that a lot of the things that he (Trump) says are directed at his base of support," said Burwell. "And they're not necessarily really based on familiarity with international issues as much as they are on reaffirming the messages that he sent during the campaign," the expert added. Meanwhile, Burwell believed that Trump holds a personalistic view of international politics. "Trump sees himself as a deal maker," believing that the personal touches could make the deal, the expert said. However, when it comes to Europe, it is more like a system based on institutions rather than personalities. Obviously, "the president is much more interested in personalities," said Burwell, hinting that it can somehow explain Trump's unease when dealing with Europe. CONNECTIONS BUILT IN DECADES Despite current disputes and name-calling rhetoric, Burwell still observes close cooperation on security across the Atlantic. "In fact, we were seeing more U.S. engagement in military exercises, more deployment in Europe, and more funding behind the deployments," said the scholar. After all, the trans-Atlantic connections "have been built up over many decades," she said. Meanwhile, Burwell also admitted that Washington and its European allies are "at a difficult place," where, differing from those "bad places" they had before, the problems come "from the president himself." Given Trump's unpredictable temperament, it is really difficult to say if there will be "moments of reconciliation" in the coming high-level encounters like the NATO summit, said Burwell. "We just don't know at this point," she added.

"We are now at a place where over the next couple of years ... we will see whether that public sympathy for us continues," the expert said. DIPLOMACY OR CAMPAIGN PROMISE For Burwell, the upcoming July 11-12 NATO summit in Brussels, which will gather leaders of the 29-nation security bloc, can be a chance for Trump to mend ties with the European allies. The defense spending is no doubt among the major topics for the summit. Trump has long been scolding those NATO countries which have not met the 2-percent-of-GDP benchmark. "I think most of the countries can make a very good case of that by 2024," the expert said. However, Burwell told Xinhua that what worried her most was the issues "that are not directly related to NATO," particularly "since the G7 (Group of Seven) summit ended as it did." Amid criticism from Germany and France, Trump unexpectedly withdrew his support for a G7 communique inked at a Canadian summit in early June, after calling Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau "very dishonest and weak." "If there is a revisiting of that and then that could be a challenge for the NATO summit," Burwell commented. For Burwell, Trump's understanding of U.S. foreign policy may not be of anything similar to his predecessors. "We need to understand that a lot of the things that he (Trump) says are directed at his base of support," said Burwell. "And they're not necessarily really based on familiarity with international issues as much as they are on reaffirming the messages that he sent during the campaign," the expert added. Meanwhile, Burwell believed that Trump holds a personalistic view of international politics. "Trump sees himself as a deal maker," believing that the personal touches could make the deal, the expert said. However, when it comes to Europe, it is more like a system based on institutions rather than personalities. Obviously, "the president is much more interested in personalities," said Burwell, hinting that it can somehow explain Trump's unease when dealing with Europe. CONNECTIONS BUILT IN DECADES Despite current disputes and name-calling rhetoric, Burwell still observes close cooperation on security across the Atlantic. "In fact, we were seeing more U.S. engagement in military exercises, more deployment in Europe, and more funding behind the deployments," said the scholar. After all, the trans-Atlantic connections "have been built up over many decades," she said. Meanwhile, Burwell also admitted that Washington and its European allies are "at a difficult place," where, differing from those "bad places" they had before, the problems come "from the president himself." Given Trump's unpredictable temperament, it is really difficult to say if there will be "moments of reconciliation" in the coming high-level encounters like the NATO summit, said Burwell. "We just don't know at this point," she added.

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 complementary.

The image shows U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev signing the INF treaty in 1987. The news events set is about the current U.S.-Europe relations and the upcoming NATO summit. The image is complementary to the news events set because it provides historical context for the current situation. The INF treaty was a major arms control agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union. It was signed in 1987 and it led to the destruction of all intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe. The treaty was a major step in reducing the risk of nuclear war between the two superpowers. The image is complementary to the news events set because it shows that the United States and Russia have been able to work together in the past to reduce the risk of nuclear war. This is a hopeful sign for the future of U.S.-Europe relations.

Protestors carry placards as they take part in a rally in Brussels on July 7, 2018, against the forthcoming NATO summit and scheduled visit of U.S. President Donald Trump on July 11 and 12. (Xinhua/AFP) by Xinhua writers Liu Chen, Guo Yina WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The current U.S.-Europe relations are at a "difficult" time with a looming trade war and lingering political disputes, said a U.S. expert on the trans-Atlantic ties. It's hard to predict their future right now, Frances Burwell, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council, a U.S. think tank, told Xinhua in an interview ahead of the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels. "A LOT MORE BARK THAN BITE" The United States' relations with Europe, its traditional closest ally, have been bumpy since President Donald Trump took office in 2017, as Washington kept lashing out at Europe's "unfair trade practices" amid their disagreements on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. Trump, in his first year of presidency, has already started to complain about imports of German cars and almost anywhere where the United States has a "trade imbalance," said Burwell. It was "a lot more bark than bite," the expert said. But now, "the bite is becoming as loud as the bark," Burwell noted. Recently, Trump has shaken up the world trading system by imposing tariffs on nearly all steel and aluminum imports for "national security reasons," including those from its European Union allies. Now Washington is considering doing the same for imports of automobiles. Linking the trade disputes to a "national security threat" is something that is "very difficult" for the Europeans to understand, Burwell, who once served as director of the Program on Transatlantic Relations at the Washington D.C.-based think tank, told Xinhua. The scholar warned that the disruption that the "bite" can cause should not be underestimated. She pointed out that the Europeans used to see Americans "as law-abiding, as trustworthy allies," a viewpoint she is not sure whether the Europeans are still holding. "We are now at a place where over the next couple of years ... we will see whether that public sympathy for us continues," the expert said.

© Francois Lenoir / Reuters European Council President Donald Tusk called on Donald Trump to be more respectful towards America's allies ahead of a NATO summit, arguing that they are now in short supply."Dear America, appreciate your allies, after all you don't have that many," Tusk said after signing a statement on cooperation between the EU and NATO.The declaration was signed ahead of a two-day meeting of NATO members in Brussels starting Wednesday, in which Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, will represent the European Union.Trump brushed aside Tusk's criticism as he was leaving the US for a trip to Europe, which will include a NATO summit, a visit to the UK and his first dedicated bilateral meeting with Russia's Vladimir Putin:The US leader has been repeatedly voicing his unease about NATO partners. He once branded the bloc a vehicle used by European allies to abuse America's generosity and gain military protection while failing to pull their weight financially. The rhetoric sparked fears in Europe that the US may announce the downgrading of its military presence on the continent during this week's meeting.The abrasive personal style and US-centered policies of the US president put long-established ties between America and its closest allies under strain. Critics say Trump undermined US global leadership less than half-way through his first term.Some European nations, including heavyweight Germany, have been targeted by the Trump administration for energy trade with Russia. Washington threatened European companies involved in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project with sanctions. In Germany the threat is perceived as an attempt to push the expensive liquefied natural gas produced by the US to the European market.Threats of sanctions are also used by the US to push Europeans away from Iran after Trump withdrew America from a key multilateral deal with Tehran over its nuclear program. Negotiated under Barack Obama, the 2015 deal offered Iran the lifting of economic sanctions and new business opportunities in Europe in exchange for placing significant restrictions and a transparency mechanism on its nuclear industry. The withdrawal came against vocal criticism from other participants of the agreement, including Russia, China and the EU.

News article:
Trump's attacks on Germany have become routine, but they have strengthened rather than weakened the chancellor at home. So, does Trump merely have a personal problem with Merkel, or does he have other motives? Donald Trump seems to have a Germany obsession, the country's biggest newspaper, Bild, said on Thursday. Whether it's the country's refugee policy (Merkel is "ruining Germany," he tweeted in 2015), luxury cars (he told Playboy as long ago as 1990 that he would like to tax them more heavily), or its NATO contributions, the US president has consistently picked on Germany when he needs a foreign power to lash out at. The latest rock was thrown on Wednesday night, when Trump took to Twitter to repeat his blustering opening tirade before NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels. For the US president, Germany's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline deal with Russia was at odds with its defense budget, which he thinks is too low. Defending Merkel Once Merkel had delivered her own reaction, in the form of a history lesson and her personal history in East Germany, other German government politicians lined up to reject Trump's criticisms. First Foreign Minister Heiko Maas vehemently rejected Trump's description of Germany as a "captive of Russia." Germany was one of the "guarantors of the free world," he told reporters in Brussels. "We're not captives — neither of Russia nor the US." Meanwhile, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen pointed out to US radio station NPR that Trump's assertion that Germany gets 70 percent of its energy from Russia was "simply not true." The actual figure, the German government said, is around 9 percent. Merkel's coalition partners also circled the wagons. "The accusations of the American president against Germany because of the building of Nord Stream 2 are not objective and immoderate," said Rolf Mützenich, senior MP of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), in a statement. "They simply follow his trade policy instincts." Mützenich went on to explain patiently why building a new gas pipeline from Russia to Europe made economic sense for Germany, and contrasted Trump's "intimidation attempts" with the more diplomatic approach from Ukraine, whose government has its own concerns about Nord Stream 2. Read more: Opinion: A NATO summit in Trump's parallel universe Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen pointed out the facts to Donald Trump Image: Reuters/R. Krause Germany's former foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, also of the SPD, accused Trump of angling for a "regime change" in Berlin. "America under Trump cannot be relied upon," Gabriel told the Spiegel news magazine. "Trump is giving the North Korean dictator a survival guarantee and wants regime change in Germany at the same time." He also urged Germany to strengthen its stance and issue "clear, firm, and above all, unified European responses," to Trump. "We can't stand for this," Gabriel said. "If he demands billions of dollars for US military expenses, then we have to demand the return of billions spent on refugees that were created by failed US military intervention in Iraq." Strengthening Merkel It's no secret that Trump and Merkel have a poor personal relationship, but German political analysts don't think she is Trump's real target. "He sees Germany as the entry point to try to crack the European Union," said Josef Janning, head of the Berlin bureau of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). "Because if you want to crack a pack, you attack the alpha animal." But even if Trump succeeds in weakening the EU, Janning thinks it is having the opposite effect on Merkel herself – especially in the rift between herself and those on the right of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and the domestic forces who would like to see the end of the Merkel era. "Within her own government she is closing the ranks, very clearly," he told DW. "When she is under obviously unfair attack from the outside, that will bring at least the mainstream together behind her." Janning argued that Trump's stark overstatements, be it on trade, on defense spending or on Russia, might play well with voters supporting the fringes of the German political spectrum, but not with Merkel's own CDU voters – even the more conservative ones. Undermining the world order But for other analysts, all this is beside the point. Claudia Major, senior researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP), thinks the criticism of Germany is just a sideshow. "It's not about Merkel or Russia or energy or pipelines, or any of that," she told DW. "That's just an excuse for Trump. For him it's about completely undermining the multilateral trans-Atlantic order as we know it. And I think that the scale of the problem we have hasn't yet been realized in Germany. If he valued NATO, and if he felt that its survival was important, he wouldn't act this way." Read more: Can the trans-Atlantic relationship survive Donald Trump? Major pointed out that Trump had taken up a different position to most of his European partners on nearly every major international issue, from the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement to moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. "Trump rejects the entire multilateral, rule-based architecture — like NATO, WTO, EU — which is based on solidarity," she said. "What he wants is not alliances but deals." She also had little optimism about the apparent agreement on Thursday that NATO partners would raise their defense expenditure. "Do you think he's going to be happy with 2 percent?" she asked. "The core function of NATO — as a defensive alliance — has already been enormously undermined by all this bickering. Even if he says now that 2 percent is great — the damage has been done." "I think he has Germany especially in his sights because Germany stands for everything he thinks is stupid," Major added. "But at the end of the day, Germany is just the hook — it's about much more."

Krause Germany's former foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, also of the SPD, accused Trump of angling for a "regime change" in Berlin. "America under Trump cannot be relied upon," Gabriel told the Spiegel news magazine. "Trump is giving the North Korean dictator a survival guarantee and wants regime change in Germany at the same time." He also urged Germany to strengthen its stance and issue "clear, firm, and above all, unified European responses," to Trump. "We can't stand for this," Gabriel said. "If he demands billions of dollars for US military expenses, then we have to demand the return of billions spent on refugees that were created by failed US military intervention in Iraq." Strengthening Merkel It's no secret that Trump and Merkel have a poor personal relationship, but German political analysts don't think she is Trump's real target. "He sees Germany as the entry point to try to crack the European Union," said Josef Janning, head of the Berlin bureau of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). "Because if you want to crack a pack, you attack the alpha animal." But even if Trump succeeds in weakening the EU, Janning thinks it is having the opposite effect on Merkel herself – especially in the rift between herself and those on the right of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and the domestic forces who would like to see the end of the Merkel era. "Within her own government she is closing the ranks, very clearly," he told DW. "When she is under obviously unfair attack from the outside, that will bring at least the mainstream together behind her." Janning argued that Trump's stark overstatements, be it on trade, on defense spending or on Russia, might play well with voters supporting the fringes of the German political spectrum, but not with Merkel's own CDU voters – even the more conservative ones. Undermining the world order But for other analysts, all this is beside the point. Claudia Major, senior researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP), thinks the criticism of Germany is just a sideshow. "It's not about Merkel or Russia or energy or pipelines, or any of that," she told DW. "That's just an excuse for Trump. For him it's about completely undermining the multilateral trans-Atlantic order as we know it. And I think that the scale of the problem we have hasn't yet been realized in Germany. If he valued NATO, and if he felt that its survival was important, he wouldn't act this way." Read more: Can the trans-Atlantic relationship survive Donald Trump? Major pointed out that Trump had taken up a different position to most of his European partners on nearly every major international issue, from the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement to moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. "Trump rejects the entire multilateral, rule-based architecture — like NATO, WTO, EU — which is based on solidarity," she said. "What he wants is not alliances but deals." She also had little optimism about the apparent agreement on Thursday that NATO partners would raise their defense expenditure. "Do you think he's going to be happy with 2 percent?" she asked. "The core function of NATO — as a defensive alliance — has already been enormously undermined by all this bickering. Even if he says now that 2 percent is great — the damage has been done." "I think he has Germany especially in his sights because Germany stands for everything he thinks is stupid," Major added. "But at the end of the day, Germany is just the hook — it's about much more."

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 complementary.

The image shows Donald Trump and Angela Merkel standing with their backs to each other, which is a metaphor for the strained relationship between the two leaders. The image is cropped in such a way that only their heads and shoulders are visible, which emphasizes the seriousness of the situation. The image is taken from a low angle, which makes Trump look more powerful and Merkel look more vulnerable. The overall tone of the image is negative, which reflects the current state of relations between the United States and Germany.

News article:
Trump and Europe: Friend or Foe? By Jamie Dettmer July 17, 2018 Europeans have reacted with a mixture of alarm and relief to Monday’s summit between President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. They are relieved the U.S. leader did not give away any aces but they remain queasy about Trump’s apparent eagerness to get on with the Russian leader while displaying to them a combativeness normally reserved for opponents rather than allies. Their mood was downcast even before the summit kicked-off, disheartened by President Trump denouncing the European Union as a greater "foe" than Russia and China in a media interview just hours before the summit in Finland’s capital Helsinki. Beforehand, there was alarm in Europe on whether the U.S. President would be lured by the more experienced and disciplined summiteer Putin into giving ground on the Russian annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula or Moscow's fomenting of rebellion in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. But the Russian president apparently secured no concessions on Crimea, no public promise to re-admit Russia into the G7, and no reversal on Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. And Trump maintained opposition to the Nord Stream 2 natural-gas pipeline, which will be increasing Russian energy exports to Germany. But what Trump described as a "deeply productive dialogue" and a first step in improving strained relations between the U.S. and Russia has prompted accusations in Europe that, in his eagerness to be an international deal-maker, he overlooks Kremlin aggression – including alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 White House race. The summit dominated the front pages of Europe’s newspapers Tuesday with Spain’s ABC running a full-page picture of the leaders of the world’s biggest nuclear-armed nations shaking hands, under the tart headline: "Trump and Putin: Such friends." The paper said the two leaders had buried the Cold War and the issue of Russian interference in America’s election – at least "for now." Another Spanish newspaper, El País, said Trump was befriending Putin while bashing the EU. And Belgium’s Le Soir argued Trump had "aligned himself" with Putin over his own authorities on the subject of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Some newspapers were less indignant. Belgium’s De Morgen wrote that the leaders were "working on their relationship" in a story headlined: "On to a better future." But Britain’s Daily Telegraph, a newspaper that has generally been sympathetic to Trump, especially over his spats with Europe, said the U.S. leader’s aim to establish peace was laudable. At the same time, it warned the summit was a big win for the Kremlin. "By affording him [Putin] the trappings of an equal partner Mr. Trump has given President Putin what he craved most: respect… The relationship has been reset without the Russians having to change anything," the paper said in an editorial. The reaction of European leaders and officials to Trump has been subdued. Few have gone public with their thoughts, preferring to stay out of the furious fight between the U.S. president and his critics in the U.S. over the summit. But privately there is indignation at Trump’s blaming the West as much as Russia for the strained relations, with German officials saying the summit advances their fears of a widening rift between Europe and Trump-led America. Privately, they worry that Trump’s determination to forge a personal bond with Putin is adding to a shift in the dynamics of America’s relationship with Europe. "I am relieved there were no concessions," said a senior British diplomat. "But it is unnerving to see the U.S. President being friendlier with Putin than with America’s traditional allies," he said. Speaking to Britain's Sky News, Jeremy Greenstock, a former British ambassador to the U.N., said he regarded Trump's effort to forge better relations with Putin a "good thing." But faulted the U.S. leader, saying, "he is doing it naively and is taking too much from President Putin at face value." Coming on the back of a pre-summit interview during which Trump described the EU as a "foe," European officials and analysts are still scrambling to understand what he meant and whether the U.S. and Europe are set on a path of separation. Some officials console themselves by saying Trump seems to use "foe" and "competitor" as interchangeable. And they point to the formal paperwork of diplomacy as more reassuring, like the 23-page communique agreed at last week’s NATO summit, which reaffirmed the alliance’s principle of collective defense and rebuked Russia. "We are confronted with that dilemma that we have often had with the Trump administration," said Mark Leonard of the European Council for Foreign Relations. "The president is a raging bull, he makes all sorts of statements, yet the policy beneath him doesn’t look that dramatically different than traditional American policy. And so people are left trying to figure out who they should believe – the policy or the President of the United States." In some ways, the Europeans have no alternative but to hold fast to the idea that the transatlantic relationship remains solid – their security assumptions are based on it and they are not ready to go it alone, say analysts. In the margins of last week’s summit, U.S. senators and government officials went out of their way to reassure America’s formal European allies and to soothe frayed nerves, saying they should discount Trump’s freewheeling statements and not interpret them at face value, arguing it is the way he wheels-and-deals, pursuing tactics of disruption to get what he wants. "It isn’t personal; it is business, I was told by a White House aide," a European minister told VOA. Cutting through Trump’s transactional approach, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis reaffirmed the "unbreakable trans-Atlantic bond," underscoring after NATO’s tumultuous summit Washington’s enduring commitment to peace and prosperity on the European continent at a meeting of southern European security ministers in Zagreb, Croatia. But some European officials see an emerging trend with U.S. policy decisions and actual decisions being colored – or telegraphed – by the presidential tweets, pointing to Trump’s early social-media threats of a trade war with Europe and his subsequent hiking of tariffs on imported European metals. "President Trump has personally made criticism of Europe, and particularly the European Union, pivotal to his foreign policy," according to Robin Niblett of Britain’s Chatham House. "Europe is the poster child for his thesis that America has been taken advantage of for the past 30 years," Niblett said in an expert comment posted on the Chatham House web-site. "Trump doesn’t believe in allies," argued Mark Leonard in a podcast. "If you think about America First and you think about the transactional approach, it means you work with the countries you can work with at that moment. You don’t really have long-term relationships. Allies are a problem. They are sort of like relatives who show up at your house to borrow money and stay all day and won’t leave your pool," he says.

News article:
A file picture shows children walking past damaged homes in the West Bank Bedouin camp of Khan al-Ahmar on April 7, 2016 after Israeli authorities demolished four houses they said were built without permission Israel's supreme court ruled Thursday in favour of demolishing a Palestinian Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank, despite a campaign by European governments to save it. Campaigners said the hearing had been the final appeal open to the village of Khan al-Ahmar, located close to several Israeli settlements east of Jerusalem. It was unclear when the demolition of the village home to around 180 residents would take place. In its ruling the court said it found "no reason to intervene in the decision of the minister of defence to implement the demolition orders issued against the illegal structures in Khan al-Ahmar." The residents would be relocated elsewhere, it added, in a move critics say amounts to forcible transfer. The court ruled that the village was built without the relevant building permits. Such permits are nearly impossible to obtain for Palestinians in Israeli-controlled areas of the West Bank. "This verdict takes away the absolute minimal protection the Bedouin communities received until recently from the court," Shlomo Lecker, the lawyer representing the village, said in a statement. "By any standard of international humanitarian law, the verdict is an approval by the Israeli court of a crime against humanity." The decision was likely to be met with anger by European governments, who had been fighting to save the village. Last week the head of the British consulate-general in Jerusalem visited the village and said in a video clip published online that the planned demolition was a "matter of great concern for the UK and indeed for the European Union." Earlier Thursday Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman announced 2,500 new settlement units in the West Bank. All settlements are considered illegal under international law.

"This verdict takes away the absolute minimal protection the Bedouin communities received until recently from the court," Shlomo Lecker, the lawyer representing the village, said in a statement. "By any standard of international humanitarian law, the verdict is an approval by the Israeli court of a crime against humanity." The decision was likely to be met with anger by European governments, who had been fighting to save the village. Last week the head of the British consulate-general in Jerusalem visited the village and said in a video clip published online that the planned demolition was a "matter of great concern for the UK and indeed for the European Union." Earlier Thursday Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman announced 2,500 new settlement units in the West Bank. All settlements are considered illegal under international law.

News article:
Students walk home from school in the Palestinian village of Khan al-Ahmar. Their village and school will be destroyed to make way for Israeli settlements. Faiz Abu Rmeleh ActiveStills Israel’s high court this week approved the forced displacement of residents from Khan al-Ahmar village in the occupied West Bank. Their village will be destroyed to make way for the expansion of Israeli settlements. That is a war crime under international law, human rights groups have warned. Israel issued expulsion orders to residents of Khan al-Ahmar multiple times in the past year, even though legal proceedings were ongoing in Israeli courts. The Israeli authorities were waiting for the high court’s blessing to complete the forcible transfer. Following this week’s verdict, the village can be destroyed “any time the government sees fit as of next month,” the Tel Aviv newspaper Haaretz reported. Residents had devised an alternative plan for their community but it was rejected by Israel’s defense ministry. A village leader, Eid Khamis Jahalin, said that residents of the community do not accept the court’s decision, according to Quds News Network. He stressed that there is no alternative for the community other than to return to the Naqab region of historic Palestine, from which they were originally displaced by the Israeli military in the 1950s. “Israel has not made a counteroffer for the issue to be resolved without a demolition,” The Times of Israel reported. Khan al-Ahmar is home to members of the Jahalin Bedouin tribe. It includes 32 families, numbering more than 170 people, half of them children. The entire community will be forcibly displaced to an area near the garbage dump for the Palestinian village of Abu Dis to make way for Israeli settlement expansion. Palestinian schoolchildren pose for a picture in Khan al-Ahmar. Israel is planning to demolish their school, which serves 160 children from five villages. Faiz Abu Rmeleh ActiveStills A judge on the case, Noam Sohlberg, said he was aware that the forced displacement of the community near the landfill “does not suit their needs as residents and as schoolchildren.” The judge added, however, that the jury in the case was not concerned with the plan for the community but in assessing the legality of the proposed demolition. Khan al-Ahmar’s school was built in 2009 out of rubber tires and mud with the help of an Italian organization – in an attempt to evade Israel’s restriction on Palestinians using cement for construction – and has been under constant threats of demolition. It is the “only school accessible to 160 children from five villages in the area,” Human Rights Watch has stated. Making way for illegal settlements Khan al-Ahmar is located in Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank. Area C remains under complete Israeli military rule under the terms of the Oslo accords signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1990s. Israel has refused to permit nearly all Palestinian construction in Area C, forcing Palestinians to build without permits and to live in constant fear that their homes will be demolished. Khan al-Ahmar also lies between the Israeli settlements of Maaleh Adumim and Kfar Adumim. This land east of Jerusalem, the so-called E1 area, is where Israel plans to expand its mega-settlement of Maaleh Adumim, completing the isolation of the northern and southern parts of the West Bank from each other. All of Israel’s settlements in the occupied West Bank are illegal under international law. International calls The high court’s decision also comes after numerous international calls to stop the demolition. More than 70 US lawmakers wrote a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on 21 May urging him to halt the demolition of Khan al-Ahmar and Susiya, a second village. “Instead of forcibly evicting Palestinian communities, we encourage your government to fairly re-evaluate their requests for building rights,” the letter states. It follows a letter written last year by 10 US senators who also appealed to Netanyahu to halt the demolitions. European Union delegations have paid visits to Khan al-Ahmar in the past year to also show support for the community. The EU has funded some construction projects in the neighborhood. EU Heads of Missions in Jerusalem and Ramallah visited Khan al Ahmar. They are deeply concerned about the stated intention of Israeli authorities to demolish & force relocation of the community.

The image shows four Palestinian schoolgirls walking home from school in the Palestinian village of Khan al-Ahmar. The village is located in Area C of the occupied West Bank, which is under complete Israeli military rule. Israel has refused to permit nearly all Palestinian construction in Area C, forcing Palestinians to build without permits and to live in constant fear that their homes will be demolished. Khan al-Ahmar is one of 12 Palestinian communities in the area east of Jerusalem that are now facing expulsion. The Israeli high court recently approved the forced displacement of residents from Khan al-Ahmar, and the village is expected to be demolished in the coming months.

The image is complementary to the news events set because it provides a visual representation of the human toll of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. The image shows the innocent faces of four young girls who are simply trying to get home from school. The image is a reminder that the Israeli occupation has a real and lasting impact on the lives of ordinary Palestinians.

News article:
Israeli authorities have resumed excavation work at the historic Bab Al-Rahma cemetery, just outside the eastern wall of Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. Israel's Nature And Parks Authority (INPA) reportedly began digging up graves about three weeks ago in order to establish "a national park on parts of the cemetery's land," Wafa said. The centuriesold cemetery has great religious significance and is the site of the graves of Ubada ibn as-Samit and Shadad ibn Aus, companions of the Prophet Muhammad. Wafa said INPA last month fenced off the parts of the cemetery it plans to annex, including the land on which the Muslim leaders are buried. Several Palestinians were reportedly injured by Israeli police as they tried to stop the demolition of the graves over the weekend. Demolition at Bab Al-Rahma began in 2015, when Israeli authorities announced they would seize sections of the cemetery to build a national park trail. Israel has no legal rights to annex land in occupied East Jerusalem, according to several United Nations resolutions. However, such desecration of holy sites – both Muslim and Christian – is routinely carried out by Israel.

A number of Israeli settlers yesterday seized a Palestinian house in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, local media reported. The spokesman of the Youth Against Settlements (YAS) movement, Mohammed Azghir, told Safa that the settlers took over a Palestinian house in the neighbourhood of Qaitun. "The house is currently occupied by the settlers and is being guarded by the occupation's military forces," Azghir added. He explained that the area has been besieged by the Israeli forces since 2001, noting that Palestinians have not been allowed to access it. In 2016, the UN Security Council overwhelmingly approved Resolution 2334 which considered Israeli settlements in the 1967 occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, as "illegal". Fourteen States voted in favour, while the United States abstained without using its power of veto. Read: Israel approves construction of 261 settlement units in Hebron

News article:
Israeli Supreme Court Issues Decision to Demolish Khan Al-Ahmar Bedouin Community, East of Jerusalem Ref: 58/2018 The Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR) condemns the Israeli Supreme Court’s decision to demolish Khan Al-Ahmar Bedouin Community, east of occupied Jerusalem, and expresses its concern over implementing this decision at any moment by Israeli forces. PCHR calls upon the international community to immediately intervene and assume its legal and moral responsibilities to stop the implementation of this serious scheme that is in favor of the settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). According to PCHR’s investigations, on Thursday, 24 May 2018, the Israeli Supreme Court Justices Noam Solberg, ‘Anat Brown and Yael Fellner, issued a decision that allow Israel to demolish the houses of Khan Al-Ahmar Bedouin Community, east of the city, and to transfer them from their houses to what is known as “Jerusalem Gate” in al-‘Izariyah village, east of the City. The demolition decision included all the Bedouin community houses, including a mosque and a school that were built of mud bricks and rubber tires. ‘Eid Khamis Jahaleen, Head of Khan al-Ahmar Bedouin community, said that he was informed of the court’s decision on Thursday, 24 May 2018. He also stated that the court held a hearing on 25 April 2018 to consider the challenge on the displacement decision. At that time, a decision was issued to give the Bedouin Community residents 10 days to find another place. ‘Eid Jahaleen expected the demolition and displacement decisions will be implemented at any moment. Khan Al-Ahmar Bedouin Community, which is near “Ma’ale Adumim” and “Kefar Adumim” settlements established east of Jerusalem, shelters around 35 families comprised of 190 persons who live in tin-plate houses and tents. Regarding the school, it is the only one in the community that includes around 170 students and 16 teachers. The number of the Bedouin communities, east of Jerusalem, is 23 communities where around 5,000 civilians live. This Bedouin area in East Jerusalem is one of those areas that have been targeted by the colonization for decades. The Israeli Government has unprecedentedly accelerated its settlement, particularly in East Jerusalem and its surroundings. On 16 November 2017, the Organization and Construction Department of the Israeli Civil Administration issued orders to evacuate the residents of Pope Mountain Community in al-‘Izzariyha village near “Ma’aleh Adumim” settlement. This community is inhabited by 57 families comprised of 320 members; half of them are children. In the same date, the Israeli Prime Minister issued a decision ordering the Palestinian Bedouins living in communities to evacuate their houses in the vicinity of occupied Jerusalem, near Street No. (1) and relocate them to the Dead Sea. The later Israeli Supreme Court’s decision came in favor of the settlement projects in that area. PCHR believes that the targeting and transferring the Bedouin communities, east of occupied Jerusalem by the Israeli authorities came in favor of their settlement projects, which unprecedentedly escalated last year, particularly in East Jerusalem and its surroundings. The (E1) Settlement Plan comes at the forefront of these projects, seeking to annex the settlements established, east of the city, within the boundaries of the Israeli municipality and so separating the north of West Bank from the south of it and burry any possibility of a viable Palestinian state. In light of the above, PCHR: Calls upon the international community to intervene in order to oblige Israel to stop all its settlement activities in the oPt, particularly in East Jerusalem; Emphasizes East Jerusalem is an occupied territory, and all the measures taken by the Israeli authorities following the 1967 occupation of it do not change its legal status as an occupied territory; Confirms that all Israeli settlement activities in occupied East Jerusalem are considered a crime against humanity according to the international humanitarian law; Calls upon the High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Conventions to fulfill their obligation under Article 1 to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances; and Believes that the conspiracy of silence practiced by the international community has encouraged Israel to commit further violations of international human rights and international humanitarian laws, including the efforts made to create a Jewish majority in occupied East Jerusalem.

The community is made up of a number of small, makeshift structures, and is located in a barren area of the desert. The image is a good representation of the living conditions of the Bedouin community, and it is clear that the community is living in poverty. The image also shows the close proximity of the community to the Israeli settlement of Ma'ale Adumim, which is located on the other side of the highway. The image is a good example of how the Israeli settlements are encroaching on the land of the Bedouin community, and it is clear that the community is at risk of being displaced.

Israeli forces demolish a home in Kobar village, August 16, 2018. Photo credit: Bahaa Nasr for WAFA. Even if Palestinians fulfill the appeal requirements put in place by military order 1797, Israeli authorities maintain complete authority to proceed with demolition. Two Jerusalem legal aid organizations will petition the Israeli Supreme Court to overturn a new military order which makes it possible for Israeli forces to demolish Palestinian homes in Area C within 96 hours after delivering demolition orders. The petition follows a formal letter the Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Rights Center (JLAC) and the St. Yves Society sent to the Israeli defense ministry on June 4, 2018 in which they argue that the military order “blatantly violates…international law and contravenes existing local legislation.” The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Occupied Territories (COGAT) issued military order 1797 on April 17, 2018. COGAT, under the direct control of the Israeli defense ministry, runs civil affairs in the occupied West Bank. Order 1797 will go into effect on June 19, 2018. Under the order, COGAT excuses itself from informing Palestinian homeowners directly that their homes are slated for demolition. JLAC and St. Yves explain in a joint press release that Israeli authorities only require demolition orders be placed “next to” relevant structures 96 hours before Israeli forces arrive to execute demolitions. If a homeowner does catch wind of an impending demolition, he or she must present an approved master plan and building permit to appeal the demolition. Israel’s discriminatory housing policies in the West Bank ensure that this is an almost impossible requirement for the 300,000 Palestinians living in Area C, 60 percent of the West Bank, to fulfill. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), between 2010 and 2014, for example, Israel approved 1.5 percent of building applications in Area C. Israeli authorities, however, routinely approve of settlement master plans and even halt demolitions of settler outposts citing the existence of master plans, JLAC and St. Yves point out. Indeed, since 2017 Israeli officials have approved nearly 14,000 settlement units in the West Bank. In addition to having to produce an approved master building plan within four days, Palestinian residents of Area C attempting to forestall demolition must prove that construction on their home or home addition has been completed for six months or that the structure has been inhabited for thirty days. By requiring that Palestinians produce so many documents in such a short period of time, this military order “virtually strips the affected residents of the right to due process and the capacity to challenge the demolition orders through legal avenues, by requiring that objections to the demolition order be accompanied with a valid building permit,” JLAC and St. Yves wrote in their press release. Moreover, COGAT remains the sole arbiter of these appeals. Put differently, even if Palestinians fulfill the appeal requirements put in place by military order 1797, COGAT empowers itself to proceed with demolition anyway. St. Yves and JLAC emphasize that this new military order violates international law, including Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which defines forcible transfer of occupied populations as a crime against humanity. The order also violates Article 43 of the 1907 Hague Regulations, which requires that an occupying power respect the laws in the country that it occupies. In this case, that means the Jordanian Planning and Construction Law, which allows residents to retroactively legalize home constructions in the face of a demolition order stemming from illegal construction. One area that may be acutely impacted by this new military order is the E1 corridor, which sits between the Jerusalem municipality’s borders and the settlement of Ma’ale Adumim. For years, Israeli politicians have proposed incorporating this area, which is in Area C, into the Jerusalem municipality. Such developments are key to maintaining what Israel euphemistically calls a “demographic balance” in Jerusalem, i.e. restricting the Palestinian population to 30 percent of the city’s total population. Palestinian presence in Jerusalem today likely constitutes at least 40 percent of the city’s population. The Palestinian Authority condemned military order 1797 when it was first announced. “This illegal development would generate more crimes against Palestinian rights of access to a safe and stable living environment and would worsen the already dire conditions of 393,000 Palestinian citizens,” the government said in a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office.

According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), between 2010 and 2014, for example, Israel approved 1.5 percent of building applications in Area C. Israeli authorities, however, routinely approve of settlement master plans and even halt demolitions of settler outposts citing the existence of master plans, JLAC and St. Yves point out. Indeed, since 2017 Israeli officials have approved nearly 14,000 settlement units in the West Bank. In addition to having to produce an approved master building plan within four days, Palestinian residents of Area C attempting to forestall demolition must prove that construction on their home or home addition has been completed for six months or that the structure has been inhabited for thirty days. By requiring that Palestinians produce so many documents in such a short period of time, this military order “virtually strips the affected residents of the right to due process and the capacity to challenge the demolition orders through legal avenues, by requiring that objections to the demolition order be accompanied with a valid building permit,” JLAC and St. Yves wrote in their press release. Moreover, COGAT remains the sole arbiter of these appeals. Put differently, even if Palestinians fulfill the appeal requirements put in place by military order 1797, COGAT empowers itself to proceed with demolition anyway. St. Yves and JLAC emphasize that this new military order violates international law, including Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which defines forcible transfer of occupied populations as a crime against humanity. The order also violates Article 43 of the 1907 Hague Regulations, which requires that an occupying power respect the laws in the country that it occupies. In this case, that means the Jordanian Planning and Construction Law, which allows residents to retroactively legalize home constructions in the face of a demolition order stemming from illegal construction. One area that may be acutely impacted by this new military order is the E1 corridor, which sits between the Jerusalem municipality’s borders and the settlement of Ma’ale Adumim. For years, Israeli politicians have proposed incorporating this area, which is in Area C, into the Jerusalem municipality. Such developments are key to maintaining what Israel euphemistically calls a “demographic balance” in Jerusalem, i.e. restricting the Palestinian population to 30 percent of the city’s total population. Palestinian presence in Jerusalem today likely constitutes at least 40 percent of the city’s population. The Palestinian Authority condemned military order 1797 when it was first announced. “This illegal development would generate more crimes against Palestinian rights of access to a safe and stable living environment and would worsen the already dire conditions of 393,000 Palestinian citizens,” the government said in a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office.

News article:
Israeli authorities have recently resumed work on the park and have been seen digging up and marking graves, removing trees and fencing off areas to halt future burials. During the first weekend of June, several Palestinians were injured and arrested while protesting the desecration of the cemetery. Outside of Jerusalem proper, in the West Bank, authorities are also clearing the way for a new settlement over the village of al-Khana Ahmar, a village mostly inhabited by Bedouin refugees who were expelled from southern Israel in 1952. In 2009, an Italian aid organization constructed a school there, but Israel ordered it to be demolished one month after it opened. After that, residents in neighboring Israeli settlements petitioned the courts to demolish the community, which has been slated for destruction since February 2010. In 2015, authorities confiscated solar panels that provided the only source of electricity to the village. ​Israel plans to relocate them yet again, this time north to a village called An-Nuway'imah, allowing Jewish settlers to claim the strategically significant spot. Building an Israeli settlement there would allow the government to connect the urban Israeli settlement of Ma'ale Adumim to Jerusalem and to control the gateway between northern and southern parts of the West Bank. Abu Khamiss, a spokesman for the current Khan al-Ahmar villagers, told France 24 in 2014 that "the place where Israel wants us to ‘relocate' would be like a prison for us. We'd be surrounded by Israeli settlements, a checkpoint and military training camps." The demolition is expected to begin any day now. Already, Israeli authorities have been accused of poisoning locals' dogs under cover of night, robbing the villagers of the "faithful shepherds."

News article:
Israeli occupation forces scuffle with protesters during the eviction of 15 illegal Jewish settler families from the illegal outpost of Netiv Ha’avot in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Tuesday (Reuters photo) NETIV HA’AVOT, West Bank — Israeli occupation forces on Tuesday began evicting illegal Jewish settlers from 15 homes which Israel’s highest court ruled were built illegally on privately-owned Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank. Under a supreme court order, the 15 dwellings are to be demolished within the next few days. Hundreds of young pro-settlement hard-liners gathered on Tuesday in several of the homes slated for demolition. Some of the protesters climbed onto the roof of one dwelling and hoisted Israeli flags. A few scuffles ensued with police but for the most part, demonstrators offered passive resistance and were carried away by officers who grabbed hold of their arms and legs. Most countries consider all Israeli settlements built in the West Bank and other land captured in the 1967 war as illegal. There are now about 500,000 illegal Israeli settlers living among some 2.6 million Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank. The entire Netiv Ha’avot settlement was built without official Israeli authorisation, but the government has retroactively agreed to allow the rest of the community to stay once the 15 homes built on private Palestinian land come down. Palestinians dismissed the dismantling of a small number of homes as an empty gesture. Wassel Abu Youssef, a Palestine Liberation Organisation official said: “All settlement is illegal and must be removed. Israel is trying to fool world public opinion by removing some homes here and there while it continues to build settlements.” The Israeli government has announced a plan to pay compensation to the families whose homes are to be razed and rehouse them on adjacent tracts not owned by individual Palestinians. The remainder of Netiv Ha’avot, where some 20 houses stand on land not covered by the court ruling, is to be granted legal status and designated a neighbourhood of an Israeli government-recognised settlement, Elazar, the Cabinet decided in February. Israeli occupation authorities have carried out similar evictions in the past under court order. In February 2017, some 300 illegal settlers were removed from the unauthorised outpost of Amona in the West Bank. But settlement expansion, which has drawn Palestinian and international condemnation, has continued, with little objection from the administration of US President Donald Trump, in contrast to criticism voiced by his predecessor Barack Obama. Palestinians seek to establish a state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and say Israeli settlements are intended to deny them a viable and contiguous country. Israel’s refusal to halt settlement expansion was one of the reasons peace talks collapsed in 2014.

Israeli army forces reportedly ordered a Palestinian farmer in the Jordan Valley to evacuate his land on Tuesday, with forces saying they were going to raze the land. WAFA agency said, according to Ma’an, that Ahmad Assi Damra, from Hijlet al-Zour, east of Jericho, was ordered to evacuate his 25 dunam (six acre) plot of land, which is planted with palm trees, in order raze it. A similar order was reportedly made to another Palestinian farmer, Suleiman al-Zayed, who has planted his four dunam plot in the village of Nuweimeh, north of Jericho, with olive trees. The majority of the Jordan Valley is under full Israeli military control, despite being within the West Bank. Meanwhile, at least 44 percent of the total land in the Jordan Valley has been appropriated by Israeli forces, for military purposes and training exercises. Forming a third of the occupied West Bank and with 88 percent of its land classified as Area C, the Jordan Valley has long been a strategic area of land unlikely to return to Palestinians following Israel’s occupation in 1967.

News article:
About three weeks ago, Supreme Court Justices Noam Sohlberg, Anat Baron and Yael Willner allowed the state to destroy the Palestinian community of Khan al-Ahmar and expel its citizens to a site near a dumpster in Abu Dis. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter A total of 32 families—173 persons, including 92 children—will be expelled. All structures, including a school serving more than 150 children from Khan al-Ahmar and from neighboring Palestinian communities, will be demolished. Khan al-Ahmar is but one of dozens of Palestinian communities under threat of expulsion. It will be the first such community in many years to be forcibly expelled in its entirety and relocated deep into the enclaves the state created for its Palestinian subjects in the West Bank, though such mass forcible transfers are rare in the West Bank. Khan al-Ahmar (Photo: Amit Gilutz, B'Tselem) In recent decades, however, Israeli policymakers have been trying to silently transfer Palestinians from all of Area C (the 60 percent of the West Bank that Israel exploits as though it were its own). The upcoming war crime in Khan al-Ahmar is merely an extreme example of an expulsion strategy that Israel is undertaking vis-a-vis all Palestinian communities in Area C, to create an environment that will coerce them into leaving. The mechanical details of this environment are simple: The state forbids residents from connecting to infrastructural networks like water, sewage and electricity, prevents them from building legally, demolishes homes that residents had to build without permits, destroys basic infrastructure laid by them (such as solar panels, water containers and unpaved paths) and holds military training exercises that include firing live ammunition and shelling on agricultural land, in pastures and even within residential areas and between houses. As in the case of Khan al-Ahmar, the state does not spare educational establishments: In the last year alone, the Civil Administration demolished two schools and one kindergarten in Area C—in Jub a-Dib in the Bethlehem area, in Jabal al-Baba in the Ma’ale Adumim area and in Khirbet Zanutah in the South Hebron Hills. This left 138 children with no educational framework. Today, 45 schools in Area C are under threat of partial or full demolition. The vast majority of Palestinians in Area C cannot build legally without master plans. These do not fall from the sky, but have to be approved by the Civil Administration (spoiler alert: it never approves them). In discussing the future of Khan al-Ahmar, the Supreme Court’s basic assumption was that the residents are criminals who built their homes illegally. Yet in the West Bank, Palestinians do not have the privilege of building legally outside the small, crowded enclaves the state allocates for them. The master plans they submit for approval are rejected time after time and when they do build, having run out of options, Israel responds with demolition. In other words: The state has created an unbearable daily reality for Palestinians in Area C in order to make them leave as though of their own free will. These actions are part of a deliberate, premeditated policy aimed at expelling Palestinian residents from Area C and building (and expanding) settlements in their place. A Western-liberal state in theory; silent transfer of an entire population in practice. If we take a few steps back and look at Israel’s policy in the Occupied Territories since the Oslo Accords, a clear picture emerges. Israel is trying to concentrate Palestinians in the tiniest enclaves possible, while taking over as much land as it can. This policy is twofold: For Palestinians, creating unbearable living conditions to make them transfer themselves; for Jews, building and expanding settlements. Think about it. No infrastructure, no running water, no electricity and no educational framework for your children. You live under the constant whir of projectiles fired by training military forces, and all the while, the state destroys the few buildings and basic infrastructure you managed to lay out. Would you stay? Although Israel has been carrying out this policy of silent expulsion for years, the forcible transfer of Khan al-Ahmar’s residents to the dumpster in Abu Dis is a horrific escalation. No more coercion, no more leaving-as-though-freely, but a violent transfer out in the open. By the book. There is no telling how this decision might affect other Palestinian communities in Area C. However, Israel’s heightened motivation to accelerate the process of expulsion, coupled with the green light given by the Supreme Court in the case of Khan al-Ahmar, is a bad omen for other Palestinian communities—especially those that have legal processes pending a Supreme Court decision. These include Khirbet Umm al-Jamal and Khirbet Ein al-Hilweh in the Northern Jordan Valley, Abu a-Nuwar and Jabal al-Baba in the Ma’ale Adumim area, and the residents of Susiya and the South Hebron Hills in general. At the end of the day, whether this policy of expulsion is enacted silently over many years, and whether it morphs into open forcible transfer in Khan al-Ahmar and elsewhere, Israeli policymakers bear criminal liability for it. The prime minister, the minister of defense and the head of the Civil Administration are all responsible. The fact that Supreme Court justices openly authorized this war crime exposes the complicity of Israel’s legal system with dispossession and forcible transfer.

The image is a powerful visual representation of the human cost of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. It is a reminder that the occupation has a real impact on the lives of ordinary Palestinians. The image is also a reminder of the importance of the work of organizations like B'Tselem, which are fighting to protect the rights of Palestinians.


News article:
About three weeks ago, Supreme Court Justices Noam Sohlberg, Anat Baron and Yael Willner allowed the state to destroy the Palestinian community of Khan al-Ahmar and expel its citizens to a site near a dumpster in Abu Dis. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter A total of 32 families—173 persons, including 92 children—will be expelled. All structures, including a school serving more than 150 children from Khan al-Ahmar and from neighboring Palestinian communities, will be demolished. Khan al-Ahmar is but one of dozens of Palestinian communities under threat of expulsion. It will be the first such community in many years to be forcibly expelled in its entirety and relocated deep into the enclaves the state created for its Palestinian subjects in the West Bank, though such mass forcible transfers are rare in the West Bank. Khan al-Ahmar (Photo: Amit Gilutz, B'Tselem) In recent decades, however, Israeli policymakers have been trying to silently transfer Palestinians from all of Area C (the 60 percent of the West Bank that Israel exploits as though it were its own). The upcoming war crime in Khan al-Ahmar is merely an extreme example of an expulsion strategy that Israel is undertaking vis-a-vis all Palestinian communities in Area C, to create an environment that will coerce them into leaving. The mechanical details of this environment are simple: The state forbids residents from connecting to infrastructural networks like water, sewage and electricity, prevents them from building legally, demolishes homes that residents had to build without permits, destroys basic infrastructure laid by them (such as solar panels, water containers and unpaved paths) and holds military training exercises that include firing live ammunition and shelling on agricultural land, in pastures and even within residential areas and between houses. As in the case of Khan al-Ahmar, the state does not spare educational establishments: In the last year alone, the Civil Administration demolished two schools and one kindergarten in Area C—in Jub a-Dib in the Bethlehem area, in Jabal al-Baba in the Ma’ale Adumim area and in Khirbet Zanutah in the South Hebron Hills. This left 138 children with no educational framework. Today, 45 schools in Area C are under threat of partial or full demolition. The vast majority of Palestinians in Area C cannot build legally without master plans. These do not fall from the sky, but have to be approved by the Civil Administration (spoiler alert: it never approves them). In discussing the future of Khan al-Ahmar, the Supreme Court’s basic assumption was that the residents are criminals who built their homes illegally. Yet in the West Bank, Palestinians do not have the privilege of building legally outside the small, crowded enclaves the state allocates for them. The master plans they submit for approval are rejected time after time and when they do build, having run out of options, Israel responds with demolition. In other words: The state has created an unbearable daily reality for Palestinians in Area C in order to make them leave as though of their own free will. These actions are part of a deliberate, premeditated policy aimed at expelling Palestinian residents from Area C and building (and expanding) settlements in their place. A Western-liberal state in theory; silent transfer of an entire population in practice. If we take a few steps back and look at Israel’s policy in the Occupied Territories since the Oslo Accords, a clear picture emerges. Israel is trying to concentrate Palestinians in the tiniest enclaves possible, while taking over as much land as it can. This policy is twofold: For Palestinians, creating unbearable living conditions to make them transfer themselves; for Jews, building and expanding settlements. Think about it. No infrastructure, no running water, no electricity and no educational framework for your children. You live under the constant whir of projectiles fired by training military forces, and all the while, the state destroys the few buildings and basic infrastructure you managed to lay out. Would you stay? Although Israel has been carrying out this policy of silent expulsion for years, the forcible transfer of Khan al-Ahmar’s residents to the dumpster in Abu Dis is a horrific escalation. No more coercion, no more leaving-as-though-freely, but a violent transfer out in the open. By the book. There is no telling how this decision might affect other Palestinian communities in Area C. However, Israel’s heightened motivation to accelerate the process of expulsion, coupled with the green light given by the Supreme Court in the case of Khan al-Ahmar, is a bad omen for other Palestinian communities—especially those that have legal processes pending a Supreme Court decision. These include Khirbet Umm al-Jamal and Khirbet Ein al-Hilweh in the Northern Jordan Valley, Abu a-Nuwar and Jabal al-Baba in the Ma’ale Adumim area, and the residents of Susiya and the South Hebron Hills in general. At the end of the day, whether this policy of expulsion is enacted silently over many years, and whether it morphs into open forcible transfer in Khan al-Ahmar and elsewhere, Israeli policymakers bear criminal liability for it. The prime minister, the minister of defense and the head of the Civil Administration are all responsible. The fact that Supreme Court justices openly authorized this war crime exposes the complicity of Israel’s legal system with dispossession and forcible transfer.

The clashes started as hundreds of police officers arrived in Tapuah Maarav, a Jewish outpost in the northern West Bank, to evict 10 houses that were built without permits. The Supreme Court ruled that these houses were built illegally on privately-owned Palestinian land and should be evicted by the end of June. A police statement said that by noon, some 11 police officers were injured and six settlers were arrested for rioting. Under the international law, all Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, are illegal. However, Israel charges that the settlements, home to some 600,000 Israelis who live in heavily guarded communities among about 3 million Palestinians, are legal. Outposts like Tapuah Maarav are settlements built without official permits from the Israeli authorities and are also deemed illegal under the Israeli law.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the postponement of the evacuation and demolition of five illegal buildings in the Palestinian village of Khirbet Susya in South Mount Hebron. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter The demolition, which was scheduled for Tuesday morning, is being postponed following international pressure, Ynet has learned. This is the third time in the past few months that the evacuation is put off. Illegal construction in the Palestinian village of Kuirbet Susya (Photo: Regavim) Everything was already prepared for the evacuation. The Central Command and the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories had prepared an operation order, and hundreds of police officers and soldiers were recruited and placed on high alert. The Defense Ministry had hired civilian execution contractors and heavy equipment for the explosive demolition. But at around 10 pm Monday, an order arrived from the Prime Minister’s Office to stop the evacuation. The demolition of illegal Palestinian homes in Khirbet Susya is seen as one of the symbols of the Palestinian battle in the West Bank, and Israel has been under heavy international pressure—mainly in recent weeks—to prevent the evacuation which would have received wide international coverage. The demolition may have also been postponed due to the upcoming visit of US President Donald Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Jason Greenblatt, and his special advisor and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, this weekend.

News article:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has delayed indefinitely the scheduled demolition of a Bedouin Palestinian village in the West Bank, deemed illegal by authorities, reportedly due to intense international pressure. Foreign lawmakers and ministers have urged Jerusalem to refrain from razing houses built without a permit in Sussiya. Hundreds of police and soldiers were put on standby for the demolition, scheduled for Tuesday morning, but late Monday Netanyahu ordered a halt to the operation, according to the Ynet website. It is the third delay of the village’s court-approved demolition in the last two years. Israel maintains that the community was built illegally, but its plans to raze the villages have sparked a sustained international outcry. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms A group of 74 Democratic lawmakers from the US last month urged Netanyahu to halt the demolition of Sussiya and another village, Khan al-Ahmar. In a letter sent to Netanyahu they wrote that the “destruction and displacement of such communities would run counter to shared US and Israeli values, while further undermining long-term Israeli security, Palestinian dignity and the prospects for peacefully achieving two states for two people.” It said demolishing Sussiya and Khan al-Ahmar “endangers Israel’s future as a Jewish democracy,” and urged the government to “fairly reevaluate” Palestinian requests for building rights. Advertisement J Street, a liberal Jewish Mideast lobbying group that helped promote the appeal on Capitol Hill, welcomed the letter at the time, calling it the most significant criticism of Israeli settlement expansion by Congress ever. It followed a similar letter to Netanyahu signed by 10 Democratic senators, including such prominent figures as Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Dianne Feinstein of California. The Ynet report said Tuesday that some believe the decision to delay the demolition came due to the planned visit in Israel of US administration officials Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt, ahead of the unveiling of US President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan. The postponement was blasted by right-wing groups, who drew a comparison between the nixed demolition of the Palestinian villages and the razing of homes in two Israeli settlements in the past week, which were carried out as planned. “Netanyahu cannot only blame the High Court and the left-wing organizations, when in practice he employs strict enforcement for settlements but shows helplessness and zero action against the intensive illegal actions by the Palestinian Authority,” declared the pro-settler group Regavim, which spearheaded the High Court petition against Sussiya. Settler leader Yohai Damari, head of the Har Hebron Regional Council, decried the government’s “foolishness.” “I call on the Israeli government to do the right thing, stop making one-sided decisions, and have it as a top priority to safeguard state land for the benefit of the state and its citizens,” he said in a statement Tuesday. Advertisement Damari added that the repeated delays were a “clear message to the other side that we are turning a blind eye, and proof of that is the dozens of illegal houses built systematically every month in Area C.” Sussiya, in the southern West Bank, has been under threat of demolition for several years after Israel found that homes there had been built without authorization. The town’s residents argue that they had no choice but to build illegally because Israel’s Civil Administration rarely grants permits to Palestinians in the West Bank’s Area C, a zone officially under Israeli security and administrative control per the 1993 Oslo peace accords. A master plan devised by residents was rejected by the Defense Ministry. Israel has not made a counteroffer for the issue to be resolved without a demolition. Some 300 people live in Sussiya. They reside mainly on farmland and their community has had no running water or electricity since they were expelled from the village’s original location 30 years ago, when there were about 25 families living at the site. A number of traditionally nomadic Bedouin communities are based east of Jerusalem, where some rights groups fear demolitions could eventually clear the way for further Israeli settlement construction. Eric Cortellessa and Jacob Magid contributed to this report.

Hundreds of police and soldiers were put on standby for the demolition, scheduled for Tuesday morning, but late Monday Netanyahu ordered a halt to the operation, according to the Ynet website. It is the third delay of the village’s court-approved demolition in the last two years. Israel maintains that the community was built illegally, but its plans to raze the villages have sparked a sustained international outcry. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms A group of 74 Democratic lawmakers from the US last month urged Netanyahu to halt the demolition of Sussiya and another village, Khan al-Ahmar. In a letter sent to Netanyahu they wrote that the “destruction and displacement of such communities would run counter to shared US and Israeli values, while further undermining long-term Israeli security, Palestinian dignity and the prospects for peacefully achieving two states for two people.” It said demolishing Sussiya and Khan al-Ahmar “endangers Israel’s future as a Jewish democracy,” and urged the government to “fairly reevaluate” Palestinian requests for building rights. Advertisement J Street, a liberal Jewish Mideast lobbying group that helped promote the appeal on Capitol Hill, welcomed the letter at the time, calling it the most significant criticism of Israeli settlement expansion by Congress ever. It followed a similar letter to Netanyahu signed by 10 Democratic senators, including such prominent figures as Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Dianne Feinstein of California. The Ynet report said Tuesday that some believe the decision to delay the demolition came due to the planned visit in Israel of US administration officials Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt, ahead of the unveiling of US President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan. The postponement was blasted by right-wing groups, who drew a comparison between the nixed demolition of the Palestinian villages and the razing of homes in two Israeli settlements in the past week, which were carried out as planned. “Netanyahu cannot only blame the High Court and the left-wing organizations, when in practice he employs strict enforcement for settlements but shows helplessness and zero action against the intensive illegal actions by the Palestinian Authority,” declared the pro-settler group Regavim, which spearheaded the High Court petition against Sussiya. Settler leader Yohai Damari, head of the Har Hebron Regional Council, decried the government’s “foolishness.” “I call on the Israeli government to do the right thing, stop making one-sided decisions, and have it as a top priority to safeguard state land for the benefit of the state and its citizens,” he said in a statement Tuesday. Advertisement Damari added that the repeated delays were a “clear message to the other side that we are turning a blind eye, and proof of that is the dozens of illegal houses built systematically every month in Area C.” Sussiya, in the southern West Bank, has been under threat of demolition for several years after Israel found that homes there had been built without authorization. The town’s residents argue that they had no choice but to build illegally because Israel’s Civil Administration rarely grants permits to Palestinians in the West Bank’s Area C, a zone officially under Israeli security and administrative control per the 1993 Oslo peace accords. A master plan devised by residents was rejected by the Defense Ministry. Israel has not made a counteroffer for the issue to be resolved without a demolition. Some 300 people live in Sussiya. They reside mainly on farmland and their community has had no running water or electricity since they were expelled from the village’s original location 30 years ago, when there were about 25 families living at the site. A number of traditionally nomadic Bedouin communities are based east of Jerusalem, where some rights groups fear demolitions could eventually clear the way for further Israeli settlement construction. Eric Cortellessa and Jacob Magid contributed to this report.

Israeli soldiers invaded, Monday, the al-Jawaya area, east of Yatta town, south of the southern West Bank city of Hebron, and handed orders halting the construction of a home and a well. Rateb Jabour, the coordinator of the Popular Committee against the Annexation Wall and Colonies in southern West Bank, said the targeted property belongs to Issa Hasan Shawaheen, and is being built on his own land. He added that the army issued, over the past few months, more than ten orders, including demolition warrants, targeting Palestinian homes and structures in that area alone. The Israeli army said the Palestinian did not obtain permits from the Israeli Civil Administration Office, which runs the administrative aspect of Israel’s military occupation of the West Bank. Israel has been preventing the Palestinians from building, or expanding existing property, in Area C of the occupied West Bank, under full military and administrative control. Area C is more than %60 of the West Bank and is also subject to the seriously-escalating construction and expansion of Israel’s illegal colonies, in direct violation of International Law and the Fourth Geneva Convention.

Palestinian Bedouin children play on May 30 in the Khan al-Ahmar village, a Bedouin village which is located between the West Bank city of Jericho and Jerusalem and is under an Israeli demolition order. (AFP Photo) RAMALLAH, July 3 (Xinhua) --- The Palestinian authorities said on Tuesday that Israel's threat to forcibly transfer the Bedouin community on the periphery of East Jerusalem constitutes a "war crime." On May 24, the Israeli High Court reached a verdict to raze the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar in East Jerusalem, where 200 homes and community structures are slated for demolition. The ruling "is another testament to Israel's culture of impunity that allows it to continue endangering the very existence of the Palestinian people on their land and to commit further grave violations of international law," the Secretariat of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian presidency said in a joint statement. "There will be a war crime being committed before the eyes of the entire international community," the statement warned. The Palestinian authorities also appealed to the international community to "take concrete action to stop the Israeli occupation and to protect the Palestinian people." "Israel must be held accountable for its grave violations of the International Humanitarian Law, UN resolutions and the human rights of the Palestinian people," it said. Meanwhile, the top Palestinian political bodies accused the United States of giving the green light to Israel's threats. Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the EU's acquiescence pushed the Israeli government to "advance its annexation plans which affect vast occupied areas of vital importance for Palestine," the statement said. The community in the Khan al-Ahmar village is one of the 46 Bedouin communities in the central West Bank which the United Nations considers at the risk of forcible transfer.

Palestinian children at the Khan al-Ahmar school on 11 June. The school was built in 2009 out of rubber tires and mud in an attempt to evade Israel’s restriction on Palestinians using cement for construction, and has been under constant threats of demolition. Oren Ziv ActiveStills Israel’s destruction of the community of Khan al-Ahmar may be imminent, human rights defenders are warning. On Tuesday, the UN’s human rights office said it was concerned that residents of the community were “at high risk of forcible transfer” in coming days. Israeli forces arrived in the occupied West Bank village on Sunday, heightening fears among its almost 200 residents. Soldiers measured homes and road barriers and listed possessions, all of which is typically done prior to a demolition, according to Jahalin Solidarity, a group that advocates for the rights of the Jahalin Bedouin community. Israeli police told residents that they would be better off if they left “voluntarily,” according to Israeli human rights group B’Tselem.

This land east of Jerusalem, the so-called E1 area, is where Israel plans to expand its mega-settlement of Maaleh Adumim, completing the isolation of the northern and southern parts of the West Bank from each other. In May, Israel’s high court approved the forced displacement of the community to make way for Israeli settlement expansion. Their village will be destroyed and residents will be forced to an area near the garbage dump of the Palestinian village of Abu Dis. Residents had devised an alternative plan for their community but it was rejected by Israel’s defense ministry. Forced displacement is a war crime under international law, human rights groups have affirmed. No option to challenge demolitions Khan al-Ahmar is located in Area C, which constitutes 60 percent of the occupied West Bank. Area C remains under complete Israeli military rule under the terms of the Oslo accords signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1990s. Israel has refused to permit nearly all Palestinian construction in Area C, forcing Palestinians to build without permits and to live in constant fear that their homes or communities will be demolished. Israel is escalating its moves to force Palestinians off their lands. On 17 June, it imposed a new military order removing “any option for Palestinians to challenge demolition orders that the civil administration issues for new structures, allowing Israel to demolish homes summarily,” according to B’Tselem. The civil administration is the name Israel gives to the military bureaucracy that rules Palestinians in the occupied West Bank by force. Under the new order, the military can order the demolition of any uncompleted building, or any structure that has been completed in the last six months. This includes unoccupied buildings as well as homes whose residents moved in within the last 30 days. The military may even order the demolition of a property that has a building permit. Palestinians have just four days to appeal, after which the army can proceed with the destruction and seizure of property. “The new military order removes the façade of judicial review over demolition orders and over Israel’s planning and building policy in the West Bank,” according to B’Tselem. Fast-tracking expulsions B’Tselem pointed out that this is not the first time Israel has stripped away the façade of legal proceedings to fast-track expulsions and demolitions. In 2017, Israel began bypassing its own legal formalities in order to expedite the expulsion of Palestinians from land targeted for Israeli colonization. Previously Israel issued demolition orders for individual buildings. The expedited procedures include wholesale demolition orders for entire communities.

News article:
A liberal pro-Israel lobbying group in the United States on Wednesday accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government of using the American July 4 holiday as a “cover” to advance the court-ordered demolition of a West Bank hamlet. Clashes broke out earlier in the day between police and protesters at the illegally built Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar, east of Jerusalem, which is due to be demolished. The J Street organization said in a statement it was “outraged by the Israeli government’s dispatch of bulldozers today.” “Prime Minister Netanyahu’s government seems intent on using the July 4th holiday as cover to move forward with demolition plans that have been opposed by dozens of US lawmakers, hundreds of rabbis and thousands of pro-Israel, pro-peace Americans,” the group said in a statement. “Netanyahu and his government should know: Even on July 4th, Americans are watching their destructive actions in the West Bank, with deep frustration and concern for the damage they are doing to the future of both Israelis and Palestinians,” J Street said, noting that on July 2 it delivered a letter with 7,000 signatures to the Israeli embassy in Washington opposing the demolition.

Critics say building permits are nearly impossible to obtain for Palestinians in Israeli-controlled areas of the West Bank and the demolition is meant to clear the way for new Jewish settlements. Israel says it has offered the residents an alternative location, near a garbage dump belonging to the Palestinian town of Abu Dis. Bedouin villagers say the location is unsuitable for their way of life, and have asserted that residents of Abu Dis have warned them not to come there. According to the UN, the village has 180 residents.

Eleven people were arrested, including an activist from the B’Tselem rights group. Three police officers were lightly injured in the confrontation, the force said, and some 35 protesters were hurt, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. After a years-long legal battle, the Supreme Court approved the demolition in May. The state says the structures were built without the relevant building permits and pose a threat to residents because of their proximity to a highway. Advertisement The hamlet has been the subject of international controversy over the years for, among other things, its elementary school, which is made of tires, mud and falafel oil. Critics say building permits are nearly impossible to obtain for Palestinians in Israeli-controlled areas of the West Bank and the demolition is meant to clear the way for new Jewish settlements. Israel says it has offered the residents an alternative location, near a garbage dump belonging to the Palestinian town of Abu Dis. Bedouin villagers say the location is unsuitable for their way of life, and have asserted that residents of Abu Dis have warned them not to come there. According to the UN, the village has 180 residents.

Scuffles broke out on Wednesday between Israeli authorities and protesters who feared preparations were underway to raze a Bedouin village in a strategic part of the occupied West Bank, despite international calls for a reprieve. Protesters, including some waving Palestinian flags, tried to block a bulldozer and scuffled with police at Khan al-Ahmar on the eastern outskirts of Jerusalem. Some climbed onto the bulldozer in protest. Israeli rights group B'Tselem said nine people were arrested -- five from the village and four others, including the organisation's own head of field research. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported 35 people injured, with four taken to hospital. Police reported two arrests and said stones were thrown at officers. The incident came after activists said the Israeli military had issued a warrant to the 173 residents of Khan al-Ahmar on Tuesday, authorising itself to seize access roads to the village. Heavy equipment was seen around the village on Wednesday, prompting speculation a road was being prepared to facilitate its evacuation and demolition. "Today they are proceeding with infrastructure work to facilitate the demolition and forcible transfer of residents," Amit Gilutz, spokesman for B'Tselem, told AFP. Israeli authorities say the village and its school were built illegally, and in May the supreme court rejected a final appeal against its demolition. But activists say the villagers had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, as the documents are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank where Israel has full control over civilian affairs. Israel authorities say they have offered villagers an alternative site. The village is made up mainly of makeshift structures of tin and wood, as is traditionally the case with Bedouin villages. Britain's minister of state for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, visited the village in May and called on the Israeli government to show restraint. He warned that any forced relocation "could constitute forcible transfer of people as far as the United Nations is concerned." Such an action would be considered a violation of the Geneva Conventions. Khan al-Ahmar is located east of Jerusalem near several major illegal Israeli settlement blocs and close to a highway leading to the Dead Sea. Activists are concerned continued Israeli settlement construction in the area could effectively divide the West Bank in two. In another Bedouin village in the same region, Abu Nuwar, Israel carried out a series of demolitions Wednesday on what it described as illegally built structures. B'Tselem said nine residential structures and three agricultural ones were demolished, leaving 62 people homeless. The Israeli defence ministry's COGAT unit for civilian affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories said the demolitions had taken place after the "owners of the buildings failed to utilise the planning procedures to their fullest extent". "This despite the fact that they were given the opportunity to enquire in the matter and were told that if they did not, the illegal construction would be demolished," it said in a statement.

The image shows a Bedouin boy standing in front of a tent in a makeshift village. The tent is made of white plastic sheeting and there are several other tents in the background. The boy is wearing a white shirt and black pants and he has a stick in his hand. The image is taken from a low angle, which makes the boy look larger than he is. The background of the image is a rocky hill. The image is a good representation of the living conditions of the Bedouin people in the West Bank. The image is also a reminder of the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians.

News article:
European countries are joining forces to prevent the demolition of the Bedouin community at Khan al-Ahmar in the West Bank, said British Minister of State for the Middle East Alistair Burt on Wednesday in Parliament. France and Ireland have both has since echoed Britain's resignations in a similar statement from their foreign ministries. More European countries are expected to voice their concerns. The UN also expressed its dismay over recent Israeli actions. The office of Nikolay Mladenov, the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, tweeted that the envoy "condemns the demolitions at Abu Nuwar and preparations to demolish Khan Al Ahmar." UN envoy Nikolay Mladenov condemns Israeli actions against Bedouin village Credit: UNSCO / Twitter "Israel should stop such actions and plans for relocating Bedouin communities in the occupied West Bank," the tweet read. "Such actions are contrary to international law and undermine the two-state solution." Open gallery view Palestinians protesting the planned demolition of Khan al-Ahmar, Wednesday, July 4, 2018 Credit: Majdi Mohammed/AP The European Union joined the criticism early on Thursday, saying in a statement that the demolitions "together with plans for new settlement construction for Israelis in the same area, exacerbate threats to the viability of the two-state solution and further undermine prospects for a lasting peace." The statement further said that the EU "expects the Israeli authorities to reverse these decisions and fully meet its obligations as an occupying power under International Humanitarian Law." Britain noted that it reiterated its concerns to the Israeli government over the planned demolitions, a fact that Alistair Burt mentioned in response to a parliamentary question from Labour MP Richard Burden. “This morning, officials from our embassy in Tel Aviv and from our consulate general in Jerusalem visited Khan al-Ahmar to express our concern and demonstrate the international community’s support for that community,” said Burt. “In accordance with our long-standing policy, we therefore condemn such a move, which would strike a major blow to prospects for a two-state solution with Jerusalem as a shared capital.” He revealed that the British ambassador had protested the matter on Monday to Israeli National Security Adviser Meir Ben Shabbat. “This should not be happening and need not be happening,” added Burt. Other members of Parliament joined in the discussion. While some spoke as friends of Israel who were worried about the lack of progress in the peace process with the Palestinians, others called for Britain to immediately and unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state in response to the evacuation of Khan al-Ahmar, and what they called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s refusal to abide by international law. A similar statement released by French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnès Von Der Mühll chided the action as going against international humanitarian law, and said the demolition makes the already precarious living conditions of the villages' residents more difficult. "The villages are also located in an area which is essential for the continuity of a future Palestinian state and thus the viability of the two-state solution, which has been undermined today by the Israeli authorities’ decisions," the statement said. France urged the Israeli authorities to "refrain from any measures aimed at extending [Israeli] settlements in the Occupied Territories or making them permanent, in contravention of international law, as United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 reaffirms. France, in conjunction with its European partners, will continue to keep a close eye on the issue." Ireland has also joined the condemnation of Israel's plan to demolish the village, with Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney saying on Wednesday night that he was "extremely worried about the imminent threat to the Bedouin community of Khan al Ahmar." "The eviction of families and demolition of their homes is an action which has a strong historical resonance in Ireland, and which brings discredit on Israel," Coveney added. Coveney said that "Ireland has made these points clearly to Israeli representatives... I have also made Ireland's views on settlements known directly to the Prime Minister of Israel." He added that in light of his previous statements, he found it "deeply disappointing that Israel is nonetheless proceeding with this reprehensible action." In Israel, Joint List chairman, MK Ayman Odeh, called the planned demolition a "war crime which will leave entire families without a roof over their heads. People already evicted twice by the state, struggling now for their home and their school which gives them hope." This is not only a human injustice, Odeh said, but a political maneuver by the government to sever and dismantle the Arab settlements in C areas, and to expand the Israeli settlement blocs, "thus preventing any chance for a Palestinian state and peace." Eleven people were arrested after throwing stones Wednesday in Khan al-Ahmar. Dozens of Palestinian were wounded, according to the Red Crescent. Four were taken to the hospital, and three police officers were lightly wounded, one of whom received medical care on the scene. Representatives of Israel's Civil Administration hung notices around Khan al-Ahmar in the West Bank on Tuesday evening, warning the village's inhabitants of their impending expulsion. By Wednesday morning there were bulldozers on the scene and clashes broke out. The expulsion of several dozen Bedouin families from Khan al-Ahmar is seen as enabling future expansion of the settlement of Kfar Adumim. The notes announcing the imminent eviction do not provide a certain timeline for intervention by authorities, though sources in the defense establishment told Haaretz that it could happen in weeks, or even days. Meanwhile, the area around Khan al-Ahmar has been closed to the general public until the end of July. The Civil administration is planning to build a road to the place for the purposes of the eviction. The works are supposed to start within days and the eviction can't begin until the road is ready. The residents are supposed to be moved to Al Jabel, a village near the Abu Dis garbage dump that the state allocated for the permanent settlement of the villagers. Earlier this week, Civil Administration officers, accompanied by police officers, took measurements in Khan al-Ahmar and reportedly counted the flocks of sheep as part of a close inspection. The village houses several dozen families from the Bedouin clan of Jahalin, who moved there after their expulsion from the Negev in the 1950s. They then built their homes in Khan al-Ahmar on state-owned land. Though in theory their homes could be legalized retroactively, the state declined to go down that route and offered them alternative housing in the nearby village of Al Jabel. On May 24, following a lengthy legal campaign, Supreme Court Justices Noam Sohlberg, Anat Baron and Yael Willner allowed the state to demolish the village’s homes.

The image does not show the specific event of the demolition, but it does provide a visual representation of the Bedouin community that is facing displacement. The image also shows the harsh living conditions in the area, which are likely to be exacerbated by the demolition of the village. The image is therefore complementary to the news article, as it provides additional information and context that helps to illustrate the story.

European countries are joining forces to prevent the demolition of the Bedouin community at Khan al-Ahmar in the West Bank, said British Minister of State for the Middle East Alistair Burt on Wednesday in Parliament. France and Ireland have both has since echoed Britain's resignations in a similar statement from their foreign ministries. More European countries are expected to voice their concerns. The UN also expressed its dismay over recent Israeli actions. The office of Nikolay Mladenov, the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, tweeted that the envoy "condemns the demolitions at Abu Nuwar and preparations to demolish Khan Al Ahmar."

"Such actions are contrary to international law and undermine the two-state solution." Open gallery view Palestinians protesting the planned demolition of Khan al-Ahmar, Wednesday, July 4, 2018 Credit: Majdi Mohammed/AP The European Union joined the criticism early on Thursday, saying in a statement that the demolitions "together with plans for new settlement construction for Israelis in the same area, exacerbate threats to the viability of the two-state solution and further undermine prospects for a lasting peace." The statement further said that the EU "expects the Israeli authorities to reverse these decisions and fully meet its obligations as an occupying power under International Humanitarian Law." Britain noted that it reiterated its concerns to the Israeli government over the planned demolitions, a fact that Alistair Burt mentioned in response to a parliamentary question from Labour MP Richard Burden. “This morning, officials from our embassy in Tel Aviv and from our consulate general in Jerusalem visited Khan al-Ahmar to express our concern and demonstrate the international community’s support for that community,” said Burt. “In accordance with our long-standing policy, we therefore condemn such a move, which would strike a major blow to prospects for a two-state solution with Jerusalem as a shared capital.” He revealed that the British ambassador had protested the matter on Monday to Israeli National Security Adviser Meir Ben Shabbat. “This should not be happening and need not be happening,” added Burt. Other members of Parliament joined in the discussion. While some spoke as friends of Israel who were worried about the lack of progress in the peace process with the Palestinians, others called for Britain to immediately and unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state in response to the evacuation of Khan al-Ahmar, and what they called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s refusal to abide by international law. A similar statement released by French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnès Von Der Mühll chided the action as going against international humanitarian law, and said the demolition makes the already precarious living conditions of the villages' residents more difficult. "The villages are also located in an area which is essential for the continuity of a future Palestinian state and thus the viability of the two-state solution, which has been undermined today by the Israeli authorities’ decisions," the statement said. France urged the Israeli authorities to "refrain from any measures aimed at extending [Israeli] settlements in the Occupied Territories or making them permanent, in contravention of international law, as United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 reaffirms. France, in conjunction with its European partners, will continue to keep a close eye on the issue." Ireland has also joined the condemnation of Israel's plan to demolish the village, with Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney saying on Wednesday night that he was "extremely worried about the imminent threat to the Bedouin community of Khan al Ahmar." "The eviction of families and demolition of their homes is an action which has a strong historical resonance in Ireland, and which brings discredit on Israel," Coveney added. Coveney said that "Ireland has made these points clearly to Israeli representatives... I have also made Ireland's views on settlements known directly to the Prime Minister of Israel." He added that in light of his previous statements, he found it "deeply disappointing that Israel is nonetheless proceeding with this reprehensible action." In Israel, Joint List chairman, MK Ayman Odeh, called the planned demolition a "war crime which will leave entire families without a roof over their heads. People already evicted twice by the state, struggling now for their home and their school which gives them hope." This is not only a human injustice, Odeh said, but a political maneuver by the government to sever and dismantle the Arab settlements in C areas, and to expand the Israeli settlement blocs, "thus preventing any chance for a Palestinian state and peace." Eleven people were arrested after throwing stones Wednesday in Khan al-Ahmar. Dozens of Palestinian were wounded, according to the Red Crescent. Four were taken to the hospital, and three police officers were lightly wounded, one of whom received medical care on the scene. Representatives of Israel's Civil Administration hung notices around Khan al-Ahmar in the West Bank on Tuesday evening, warning the village's inhabitants of their impending expulsion. By Wednesday morning there were bulldozers on the scene and clashes broke out. The expulsion of several dozen Bedouin families from Khan al-Ahmar is seen as enabling future expansion of the settlement of Kfar Adumim. The notes announcing the imminent eviction do not provide a certain timeline for intervention by authorities, though sources in the defense establishment told Haaretz that it could happen in weeks, or even days. Meanwhile, the area around Khan al-Ahmar has been closed to the general public until the end of July. The Civil administration is planning to build a road to the place for the purposes of the eviction. The works are supposed to start within days and the eviction can't begin until the road is ready. The residents are supposed to be moved to Al Jabel, a village near the Abu Dis garbage dump that the state allocated for the permanent settlement of the villagers. Earlier this week, Civil Administration officers, accompanied by police officers, took measurements in Khan al-Ahmar and reportedly counted the flocks of sheep as part of a close inspection. The village houses several dozen families from the Bedouin clan of Jahalin, who moved there after their expulsion from the Negev in the 1950s. They then built their homes in Khan al-Ahmar on state-owned land. Though in theory their homes could be legalized retroactively, the state declined to go down that route and offered them alternative housing in the nearby village of Al Jabel. On May 24, following a lengthy legal campaign, Supreme Court Justices Noam Sohlberg, Anat Baron and Yael Willner allowed the state to demolish the village’s homes.

MORE than 170 children at Al Khan Al Ahmar in the West Bank have lost their school following a demolition carried out by Israeli authorities today. Forty-four schools in the West Bank at risk of demolition – Save the Children calls for immediate commitments to protect schools and the right to learn for thousands of children across the West Bank. This follows the Israeli High Court of Justice’s 24 May decision to overturn the injunction protecting the community, marking an end to many years of legal efforts and leaving virtually no legal options1 to protect local Bedouin residents from having their community demolished, including their school. Thousands more Palestinian children living under Israeli occupation are at risk of losing their right to learn, as well as their homes. According to United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), there are currently 44 schools that have been issued demolition orders, further threatening children’s ability to access education in the Palestinian Territory. Jennifer Moorehead, Save the Children’s Country Director in the occupied Palestinian territories, warned the demolitions could have a grave psychological impact on children. “The impact these demolitions have on the wellbeing of children, and their ability to learn and feel safe, cannot be understated and must not be accepted,” Ms Moorehead said. In the first seven months of 2018, four schools have been demolished. This is already more than the total number of demolitions that took place in 2017, indicating a sharp increase in the demolition of educational facilities. On top of this, in many locations children and teachers face daily violence, injuries, humiliation or even arrests on their way to school or during the school day. Nabil*, 15, has been attending the Khan Al Ahmar school for eight years.“All my siblings went to this school and all the community helped build the school, so we had many memories here. This demolition will ruin our future,” Nabil* said. Like many others Nabil* worries about how he will continue his education without a nearby school and faced with forced relocation. "School will be far away because we will be living on the mountain, and we will have to walk really far to get there. There is no one there, no friends, nobody and it will be hard on us," Nabil* said. The principle of Al Khan Al Ahmar school, Haleema a- Zahuyqa, said her students – some as young as six years old – would lose their basic rights to a safe home, including play, protection and education. "The children are under pressure – particularly emotional pressure. They are not sleeping, they are tense, and they have headaches and are scared,” Ms Ali said. Moorehead said the demolition was a breach of international law and internationally recognised provisions to protect schools in conflict areas. “Schools must be safe havens where children are able to learn and shape their future,” Moorehead said. She also warned this demolition could be a watershed case that would open the door for more to follow. “A line must be drawn to ensure that no further demolitions occur and that even more children do not see their education in jeopardy,” Moorehead said. “The Israeli government must make every effort to allow for the unhindered passage of students and school staff through checkpoints on their way to and from schools, and to ensure that schools are recognised as protected, safe places for children. “We also urge the Israeli government to take measures to protect children’s right to education and sign up to the Safe Schools Declaration. “Education is a human right that no child should be denied.” *Name changed for protection reasons For spokespersons please contact: Alex Sampson alex.sampson@savethechildren.org.au+962 (0) 791799287 or Antonia Roupell: antonia.roupell@savethechildren.org +44(0) 7879885327 Out of hours: +44 (0) 7831650409 Note to editors: ** In the first quarter of 2018 alone, there were 78 incidents of education-related violence across the West Bank affecting 26,569 children; including 17 cases of tear gas firing in/around schools, affecting 5,423 students. In 2016 there were 3 partial demolitions of classrooms in schools in the West Bank. For one of the schools, Abu Nuwwar, the classrooms were demolished twice. In 2017 three schools were demolished, and in 2018 four schools were demolished (including Al Khan Al Ahmar) to date. All of these schools were in the West Bank. Israeli Authorities argue that the buildings in the community of Al Khan Al Ahmar were illegally constructed. However, figures show that it is nearly impossible for Palestiniansto obtain building permits in Area C of the West Bank. Available figures of approved development permits across the West Bank show that between January and June 2016, only 0.5 per cent of the 428 requests were approved. In 2015, only seven out of 385 requests were approved, i.e. 1.81 per cent; and there were nine approved out of 440 requests, or 2.04 per cent, in 2014. Since 2009, the EU and its Member States have provided more than 300,000 Euros of assistance to Khan Al Ahmar community, including contributions to the school. Save the Children has been active in the area for more than 50 years, focussing on quality education, protection for children, greater access to health care and employment opportunities for youth. After a school is demolished, it also provides school materials and psychosocial support to children in schools. The Safe Schools Declaration is a political document, which provides countries the opportunity to express political support for the protection of students, teachers, schools, and universities during times of armed conflict. The Declaration contains a number of commitments aimed at strengthening the prevention of, and response to, attacks on education during armed conflict. This includes improving reporting of attacks on schools; collecting reliable data on attacks and military use of schools and universities; providing assistance to victims of attacks; investigating allegations of violations of national and international law and prosecuting perpetrators where appropriate; developing and promoting “conflict sensitive” approaches to education.

The image shows a group of children playing in a schoolyard. The schoolyard is made of dirt and there are a few trees and shrubs in the background. The children are wearing uniforms and they look happy and carefree. The image is taken from a low angle, which makes the children look bigger and more powerful than they actually are. This image is complementary to the news events set because it shows the human side of the story.

News article:
The High Court of Justice on Thursday night issued a temporary injunction preventing the state from carrying out plans to demolish a West Bank Bedouin village. Following an urgent petition submitted by Alaa Mahajna on behalf of the Bedouin community of Khan al-Ahmar, the court froze the demolition of the village, giving the state until July 11 to respond. The petition says the Civil Administration, in charge of construction permits in the West Bank, never offered any plans to legalize the village, and refused to review a plan submitted by the villagers. After a years-long legal battle, the Supreme Court approved the demolition of Khan al-Ahmar in May. The state says the structures were built without the relevant building permits and pose a threat to the village residents because of their proximity to a highway. But activists say the villagers — who have lived at the site since the 1950s after the state evicted them from their Negev homes — had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, as these are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank, such as Khan al-Ahmar, where Israel has full control over civilian affairs.

Israel has pledged to resettle the residents, which the UN says number 180 people. Israel says it has offered the residents an alternative location, near a garbage dump in the nearby Palestinian town of Abu Dis. Bedouin villagers say the location is unsuitable for their way of life, and have also said residents of Abu Dis have warned them not to come there.

On Wednesday clashes broke out between police and protesters at the village. Residents and activists attempted to block construction equipment from advancing, leading to violent scuffles. Police said in a statement that 11 people were arrested during disturbances at the site, and that rocks were thrown at officers. Israeli rights group B’Tselem said the detainees included the organization’s own head of field research. And on Thursday European diplomats tried to pay a solidarity visit to the village, but police barred them from reaching a school there.

He said that demolishing the village would be a violation of the Geneva convention, laying out the obligations of an occupier toward those under its control. It would also significantly complicate the search for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he added. Opponents of the demolition say it is part of an effort to to enable the expansion of the nearby settlement of Kfar Adumim, and to create a region of contiguous Israeli control from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea.

The image shows a group of people, some of whom are wearing flak jackets and carrying guns, standing around a bulldozer. In the background, there are a number of tents and other structures. The image is consistent with the events described in the news article, which reports that Israeli forces have been demolishing a Bedouin village in the West Bank. The image reflects the events in the news events set as the bulldozer is being used to demolish the village and the people in the image are likely residents of the village who are protesting the demolition.

 complementary.

The image shows a group of people, some of whom are wearing hard hats, sitting in the bucket of a bulldozer. In the background, there is a group of people, some of whom are wearing military uniforms, standing around. The image is taken from a low angle, which makes the people in the bulldozer look vulnerable. The image is a powerful symbol of the struggle between the Bedouin community of Khan al-Ahmar and the Israeli government. The image is complementary to the news events set because it captures the human side of the story and highlights the plight of the Bedouin community.

News article:
Turkey on Thursday "strongly" condemned the Israeli army's demolition of the Palestinian Bedouin houses in Abu Nuwar. In a statement, the Foreign Ministry also condemned "the start of preparations for demolishing in the Bedouin region of Khan Al-Ahmar in the occupied Palestinian territories". "These acts carried out by the Israeli authorities with impunity jeopardize the contiguous and independent Palestinian State perspective," it said. The ministry urged Israel to end "its illegal activities which exacerbate tensions in the region and undermine the two-state solution vision." Under 1995 Oslo agreement between Israel and Palestine, the West Bank was divided into A, B and C areas. The administrative and security authority of the area A was given to Palestine while the administration of area B was given to Palestine but security to Israel, while in area C areas, both administration and security authority, were given to Israel. The 700-person strong Abu Nuwar Bedouin community, who are in the area C, refused to leave their villages despite continuous threats and pressures from the Israeli authority.

The image shows a Palestinian boy sitting in a chair and waving a Palestinian flag in front of an Israeli bulldozer. The bulldozer is in the background, and it is not clear what it is doing. The image is taken from a low angle, which makes the boy look small and vulnerable. The boy's expression is defiant, and he seems to be challenging the bulldozer. The image is a powerful symbol of the Palestinian struggle against Israeli occupation.

The news events set is about Turkey's condemnation of Israel's demolition of Palestinian Bedouin houses in Abu Nuwar. The image is complementary to the news events set because it provides a visual representation of the human toll of the Israeli occupation. The image shows how the occupation affects the lives of ordinary Palestinians, and it highlights the need for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

News article:
The UN Human Rights Office and many European countries have slammed Israel’s decision to demolish a small Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank. Activists claim Israel wants to use the land to expand settlements. Israeli authorities have moved three bulldozers to Khan al-Ahmar, a Bedouin herding village in the West Bank, following a court’s ruling that declared the settlement illegal under Israeli law. The military already left a land confiscation notice there on Tuesday, local media reported. The Supreme Court approved the demolition in May. The village had been built without an Israeli permit, but Palestinians say they are impossible to obtain. Protests erupted at the village on Wednesday, descending into clashes with Israeli police. Two people were arrested and over 30 were injured, according to a Palestinian ambulance service. Meanwhile, high-ranked EU and international officials began pounding Israel with condemnation of the looming demolition. Liz Throssell, a spokesperson for the UN human rights office, said that “international humanitarian law prohibits the destruction or confiscation of private property by the occupying power.” Maja Kocijancic, the EU spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy, lamented the West Bank demolitions, saying they “exacerbate threats to the viability of the two-state solution and further undermine prospects for a lasting peace.” The French Foreign Ministry asserted that bulldozing Khan al-Akhram, which is located in an area “essential for the continuity of a future Palestinian state,” goes against international humanitarian law. Its statement has also accused Israel of undermining peace prospects for Palestine. Jamie McGoldrick, the UN Development and Humanitarian Coordinator in Palestine, had also called upon Tel Aviv to reverse the demolition. “Like many Palestinians in Area C, the residents of Khan al Ahmar have fought for years to live with dignity, to protect their children, their homes, and their community,” he said, urging support for people who “have struggled in the face of tremendous daily pressure.” In light of today's worrying developments in Khan al Ahmar and Abu Nuwar, I reiterate my https://t.co/QNit6u4uVf abandon plans to demolish and transfer #Palestinian communities pic.twitter.com/Q7jtQLWHch — Jamie McGoldrick (@jamiemcgoldric8) July 4, 2018 Sarit Michaeli, an international advocacy officer with B'Tselem, uploaded images of Khan al-Ahmar bracing for the demolition. “This is what a war crime looks like,” she tweeted.

The image is a powerful visual representation of the human cost of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. It shows the destruction of a Palestinian home and the displacement of its residents. The image is also a reminder of the ongoing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians and the need for a just and lasting peace.

The article describes the demolition of Khan al-Ahmar, while the image shows the destruction of a different village. However, the image does provide visual information that complements the article, as it shows the aftermath of a demolition similar to the one described in the article.

Related Scuffles as Israel readies to demolish Palestinian Bedouin village European diplomats on Thursday tried to pay a solidarity visit to a West Bank village under threat of demolition by Israel but police barred them from reaching a school there. Diplomats from Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the European Union sought to visit the school in the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar which is funded by several European countries, but they were turned back at the village entrance. Police at the scene said the area had been declared a closed military zone. "We were briefed by local leaders but refused access by security forces to the school," the Irish representative office to the West Bank wrote on its official Twitter feed. "We wanted to show our solidarity with this village which is threatened with destruction, for humanitarian reasons and because it is a major issue of international law," the Consul General of France in Jerusalem, Pierre Cochard, told journalists at the scene. He said that demolishing the village of 173 residents, east of Jerusalem in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, would be a violation of the Geneva convention laying out the obligations of an occupier toward those under its control. It would also significantly complicate the search for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he added. Israeli authorities say the village and its school were built illegally, and in May the Supreme Court rejected a final appeal against its demolition. Activists say the villagers had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, as the documents are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank, such as Khan al-Ahmar, where Israel has full control over civilian affairs. The army said on Thursday that following the court ruling the process of enforcing eviction and demolition orders was under way, but did not say when the buildings would be razed. "The organisations responsible for the matter, including security forces, have begun preparing for the execution of demolition warrants that were issued against illegal buildings in Khan al-Ahmar," it said in an English-language statement "Accordingly, the preparation of the routes necessary to enforce the warrants has begun, as well as infrastructure works in an alternative area for the residents who will be evacuated." Activists expect the demolition to happen within the next few days. Scuffles broke out Wednesday as a bulldozer went to work levelling ground next to the village in what residents believed was preparation for an imminent eviction operation. Protesters, including some waving Palestinian flags, tried to block the bulldozer and tussled with police. Some climbed onto the machine in protest. The village is made up mainly of makeshift structures of tin and wood, as is traditionally the case with Bedouin villages. Dozens of journalists and activists stood at the edge of the village on Thursday. "What the Israeli authorities are doing is a population transfer contrary to the Rome and Geneva conventions," Palestinian lawyer Munji Abdallah, 50, told AFP. Khan al-Ahmar is located near several major Israeli settlements and close to a highway leading to the Dead Sea. Activists are concerned that continued Israeli settlement construction in the area could effectively divide the West Bank in two. Search Keywords: Short link:

Related Scuffles as Israel readies to demolish Palestinian Bedouin village European diplomats on Thursday tried to pay a solidarity visit to a West Bank village under threat of demolition by Israel but police barred them from reaching a school there. Diplomats from Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the European Union sought to visit the school in the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar which is funded by several European countries, but they were turned back at the village entrance. Police at the scene said the area had been declared a closed military zone. "We were briefed by local leaders but refused access by security forces to the school," the Irish representative office to the West Bank wrote on its official Twitter feed. "We wanted to show our solidarity with this village which is threatened with destruction, for humanitarian reasons and because it is a major issue of international law," the Consul General of France in Jerusalem, Pierre Cochard, told journalists at the scene. He said that demolishing the village of 173 residents, east of Jerusalem in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, would be a violation of the Geneva convention laying out the obligations of an occupier toward those under its control. It would also significantly complicate the search for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he added. Israeli authorities say the village and its school were built illegally, and in May the Supreme Court rejected a final appeal against its demolition.

Protesters at an illegal Bedouin encampment erupted in violence against Israel soldiers on Wednesday as forces moved in to demolish the illegal building, in accordance with a Supreme Court order. Protesters and residents of Khan al-Ahmar in the Judean Desert tried to block construction equipment from paving an access road to facilitate the demolition, and rocks were thrown at officers. No injuries or damage were reported. The Supreme Court approved the demolition in May after years of legal battles, finding that the makeshift village was built illegally and posed a threat to residents due to its proximity to a highway. Among the buildings to be demolished is a school that residents put together in partnership with an Italian pro-Palestinian eco-building organization using old tires, mud and used cooking oil. Israel has pledged to resettle the estimated 180 residents near the Jerusalem Arab neighborhood of Abu Dis. The villagers have rejected the plan. Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said demolishing Khan al-Ahmar would be a violation of international law, adding that Israel, an “occupying power,” should “respect the rights of residents to remain on their land.” The commission has never issued statements regarding the demolition of Jewish buildings that Israel’s courts have determined are illegal. J Street, a left-wing group in the United States that describes itself as “pro-Israel,”” brought a petition against the demolition to the Israeli Embassy in Washington, decrying the move as “a major blow to prospects for a two-state solution.” The radical left-wing B’Tselem organization reported that reported that Israeli security forces arrived at the Bedouin camp of Abu Nawwar near the Judean desert city of Ma’ale Adumim and demolished an additional nine houses. The organization also reported that Israeli security forces arrived in the southern Hebron hills community of Susiya, preparing to demolish another seven illegal Bedouin buildings slated for demolition.

News article:
Israeli police scuffled with activists protesting the planned demolition of a Bedouin hamlet in the West Bank on Wednesday amid international opposition to the razing of the site. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said 11 people were arrested in the “disturbance” including several for throwing stones at officers in Khan al-Ahmar. He said three officers were injured, including one evacuated to a hospital for treatment. Advertisement Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian legislator, said four protesters were injured. “This is a vicious, barbaric attack on peaceful demonstrators and they are trying to demolish Khan Al-Ahmar,” he said. Israel says the structures that make up the Khan al-Ahmar encampment of corrugated shacks and tents were illegally built and pose a threat to residents because of their proximity to a highway. Police could be seen dragging a handcuffed woman and pushing a Bedouin man. A construction vehicle flattened earth near the site. The Bedouin village outside the Kfar Adumim settlement, is set to be demolished at an unknown date after Israel's Supreme Court approved the move in May. Residents and activists voiced concern on Wednesday that Israel is set to raze the Bedouin village in a strategic part of the occupied West Bank ignoring international calls for a reprieve. Activists said the Israeli military issued a warrant to the 173 residents of Khan al-Ahmar on Tuesday authorizing it to seize access roads to the village. Heavy equipment, including at least one bulldozer, was seen around the village on Wednesday, leading to speculation a road was being prepared to facilitate its evacuation and demolition. “Today they are proceeding with infrastructure work to facilitate the demolition and forcible transfer of residents,” Amit Gilutz, spokesperson for Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, told AFP. Israeli authorities say the village and its school were built illegally and in May, the supreme court rejected a final appeal against its demolition. But activists say the villagers had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits as the documents are near impossible for Palestinians to obtain for that part of the occupied West Bank. Israel authorities say they have offered villagers a relocation site. They did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Britain’s minister of state for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, visited the village in May and called on the Israeli government to show restraint. He warned that any forced relocation “could constitute forcible transfer of people as far as the United Nations is concerned.” Forcible transfer is considered a violation of the Geneva Conventions. Khan al-Ahmar is located east of Jerusalem near several Israeli settlements along a road leading to the Dead Sea. Activists are concerned that continued Israeli settlement construction in the area could effectively divide the West Bank in two.

News article:
Jerusalem, 5 July 2018 Today, the Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. Jamie McGoldrick, the Head of West Bank Operations for UNRWA, Mr. Scott Anderson, and the Head of the UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. James Heenan, expressed serious concern over demolitions and related events in vulnerable Palestinian communities in the central West Bank Yesterday, Israeli forces began levelling access routes in the Palestinian Bedouin community of Khan al Ahmar-Abu al Helu, home to more than 180 people, 95 per cent of whom are Palestine refugees. The work comes in advance of the expected demolition of the entire community. Israeli forces injured thirty-five Palestinians and arrested others, including residents, in confrontations that ensued while bulldozers were levelling all entry and exit points. One Israeli soldier was also reported injured as well. Today, the Israeli authorities have declared Khan al Ahmar a closed military area, and are heavily restricting movement of residents and preventing the entry of others to the community. “What we are seeing unfold on the ground is deeply disturbing,” said Mr. McGoldrick. “Demolitions have a devastating impact on families and on communities. These demolitions are particularly outrageous because they target communities who already live in extremely difficult conditions, with high levels of humanitarian needs. I call again on the Israeli authorities to cease demolitions and other measures that may result in the forcible transfer of Palestinians.” This situation occurs on the backdrop of a wave of demolitions across the West Bank in recent days. Since 1 July, eleven incidents have occurred, displacing 59 Palestinians, including 37 children, and affecting more than 200 others. Included within this is the demolition of 19 structures, including nine homes, in the Palestinian Bedouin community of Abu Nuwar (around 600 residents, 88 per cent Palestine refugees). As a result, 51 people, including 33 children, were displaced and another 13 people, including five children, who had family property destroyed, were directly affected. Also, one home was destroyed today in Susiya, displacing a family of five. “The escalation of events in the last few days – the demolitions in Abu Nuwar, the declaration of the Khan al Ahmar community as a closed military zone, the violence and large presence of armed Israeli forces – makes life in these communities virtually untenable. The latest developments are of serious concern as it is evident that they are undertaken with the objective of relocating the concerned communities, as well as causing serious distress to the vulnerable residents who are watching what appear to be preparations for the demolition of their community,” said Mr. Scott Anderson. “These pastoral communities are mostly Palestine refugees – originally displaced from their tribal lands in the Negev. They should not be forced to experience a second displacement against their will.” “The demolitions in the community will have serious human rights and humanitarian law consequences,” said Mr. Heenan. “There is high risk of forced evictions of individuals, destruction of private property as well as a dramatic increase in the coercive environment under which the community already lives, in turn raising the risk of forcible transfer.” END For more information, please contact Mr. Ofir Feuerstein, +972 (0) 54 33 11 836, feuerstein@un.org (mailto:feuerstein@un.org) Background: Khan al Ahmar – Abu al Helu and Abu Nuwar are among the 46 Palestinian Bedouin communities (8,100 people) at risk of forcible transfer in the central West Bank and among the more than 3,500 residents living in 18 communities located in the area slated for the E1 settlement plan that seeks to connect the Ma’ale Adummim settlement bloc with East Jerusalem. International humanitarian law (IHL) requires an occupying power to protect the population of the territory that it occupies, ensure its welfare and wellbeing, as well as the respect for its human rights. Any destruction of property by the occupying power is prohibited, except when rendered absolutely necessary by military operations, which is not relevant in the West Bank where there are currently no active hostilities.

News article:
Jerusalem, 5 July 2018 Today, the Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. Jamie McGoldrick, the Head of West Bank Operations for UNRWA, Mr. Scott Anderson, and the Head of the UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. James Heenan, expressed serious concern over demolitions and related events in vulnerable Palestinian communities in the central West Bank Yesterday, Israeli forces began levelling access routes in the Palestinian Bedouin community of Khan al Ahmar-Abu al Helu, home to more than 180 people, 95 per cent of whom are Palestine refugees. The work comes in advance of the expected demolition of the entire community. Israeli forces injured thirty-five Palestinians and arrested others, including residents, in confrontations that ensued while bulldozers were levelling all entry and exit points. One Israeli soldier was also reported injured as well. Today, the Israeli authorities have declared Khan al Ahmar a closed military area, and are heavily restricting movement of residents and preventing the entry of others to the community. “What we are seeing unfold on the ground is deeply disturbing,” said Mr. McGoldrick. “Demolitions have a devastating impact on families and on communities. These demolitions are particularly outrageous because they target communities who already live in extremely difficult conditions, with high levels of humanitarian needs. I call again on the Israeli authorities to cease demolitions and other measures that may result in the forcible transfer of Palestinians.” This situation occurs on the backdrop of a wave of demolitions across the West Bank in recent days. Since 1 July, eleven incidents have occurred, displacing 59 Palestinians, including 37 children, and affecting more than 200 others. Included within this is the demolition of 19 structures, including nine homes, in the Palestinian Bedouin community of Abu Nuwar (around 600 residents, 88 per cent Palestine refugees). As a result, 51 people, including 33 children, were displaced and another 13 people, including five children, who had family property destroyed, were directly affected. Also, one home was destroyed today in Susiya, displacing a family of five. “The escalation of events in the last few days – the demolitions in Abu Nuwar, the declaration of the Khan al Ahmar community as a closed military zone, the violence and large presence of armed Israeli forces – makes life in these communities virtually untenable. The latest developments are of serious concern as it is evident that they are undertaken with the objective of relocating the concerned communities, as well as causing serious distress to the vulnerable residents who are watching what appear to be preparations for the demolition of their community,” said Mr. Scott Anderson. “These pastoral communities are mostly Palestine refugees – originally displaced from their tribal lands in the Negev. They should not be forced to experience a second displacement against their will.” “The demolitions in the community will have serious human rights and humanitarian law consequences,” said Mr. Heenan. “There is high risk of forced evictions of individuals, destruction of private property as well as a dramatic increase in the coercive environment under which the community already lives, in turn raising the risk of forcible transfer.” END For more information, please contact Mr. Ofir Feuerstein, +972 (0) 54 33 11 836, feuerstein@un.org (mailto:feuerstein@un.org) Background: Khan al Ahmar – Abu al Helu and Abu Nuwar are among the 46 Palestinian Bedouin communities (8,100 people) at risk of forcible transfer in the central West Bank and among the more than 3,500 residents living in 18 communities located in the area slated for the E1 settlement plan that seeks to connect the Ma’ale Adummim settlement bloc with East Jerusalem. International humanitarian law (IHL) requires an occupying power to protect the population of the territory that it occupies, ensure its welfare and wellbeing, as well as the respect for its human rights. Any destruction of property by the occupying power is prohibited, except when rendered absolutely necessary by military operations, which is not relevant in the West Bank where there are currently no active hostilities. The extensive demolition of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly, may be a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and may amount to a war crime. Other than for the security of the population or imperative military reasons, IHL further prohibits the transfer of the population of an occupied territory without the genuinely and fully informed consent of the affected people, regardless of the motive.

News article:
KHAN AL-AHMAR, Palestinian Territories: Scuffles broke out on Wednesday between Israeli authorities and protesters who feared preparations were underway to raze a Bedouin village in a strategic part of the occupied West Bank, despite international calls for a reprieve. Protesters, including some waving Palestinian flags, tried to block a bulldozer and scuffled with police at Khan al-Ahmar on the eastern outskirts of Jerusalem. Some climbed onto the bulldozer in protest. Israeli rights group B´Tselem said nine people were arrested — five from the village and four others, including the organisation´s own head of field research. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported 35 people injured, with four taken to hospital. Police reported two arrests and said stones were thrown at officers. The incident came after activists said the Israeli military had issued a warrant to the 173 residents of Khan al-Ahmar on Tuesday, authorising itself to seize access roads to the village. Heavy equipment was seen around the village on Wednesday, prompting speculation a road was being prepared to facilitate its evacuation and demolition. “Today they are proceeding with infrastructure work to facilitate the demolition and forcible transfer of residents,” Amit Gilutz, spokesman for B´Tselem, told AFP. Israeli authorities say the village and its school were built illegally, and in May the supreme court rejected a final appeal against its demolition. But activists say the villagers had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, as the documents are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank where Israel has full control over civilian affairs. Israel authorities say they have offered villagers an alternative site. The village is made up mainly of makeshift structures of tin and wood, as is traditionally the case with Bedouin villages. Britain´s minister of state for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, visited the village in May and called on the Israeli government to show restraint. He warned that any forced relocation “could constitute forcible transfer of people as far as the United Nations is concerned.” Such an action would be considered a violation of the Geneva Conventions.

The image shows a Bedouin woman walking in a makeshift village. The village is made up of tents and other temporary structures. The woman is wearing a traditional Bedouin dress. The image is taken from a low angle, which makes the woman look larger than life. The background is a barren desert landscape. The image is a powerful visual representation of the plight of the Bedouin people. It is a reminder that these people are living in a very harsh environment and that they are struggling to survive. The image is also a reminder that the Bedouin people are a proud and resilient people. The woman in the image is a symbol of strength and determination. She is a reminder that the Bedouin people will not give up without a fight.

News article:
Israel's top court today suspended the planned demolition of a Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank whose fate has become a focus of Palestinian protests and international concern, a lawyer for the residents said, Reuters reports. The Supreme Court injunction, issued a day after Israeli security forces violently attacked protesters in Khan Al-Ahmar, gave the state until 11 July to respond to the villagers' contention that they had been unfairly denied building permits, lawyer Alaa Mahajna told Reuters. The court spokesman could not be reached for comment. Around 180 Bedouin, raising sheep and goats, live in tin and wood shacks in Khan Al-Ahmar. Demolition of Khan Al-Ahmar: Another chapter in the ethnic cleansing of Palestine Last year Israeli authorities informed the High Court that they plan to seize the land where the community is located and displace its residents, although the land is registered as owned by Palestinian citizens from the nearby town of Anata. The land is set to be used to expand nearby illegal Jewish only settlements. The residents of Khan Al-Ahmar, known as Al-Jahhalin Bedouins, are refugees from the Negev desert who have lived in the area south of Jerusalem since their displacement by the Israeli army in 1967. Israel has refused to recognise Al-Jahhalin Bedouin communities or grant them building permits.

Israel has long sought to clear Bedouin from the area between the two settlements, and the Supreme Court approved the demolition in May. Israel police violently attack and evict Palestinians near Jerusalem Removing the Bedouin, human rights groups say, would create a bigger settlement pocket near Jerusalem and make it more difficult for Palestinians to achieve territorial contiguity in the West Bank, a territory they seek along with the Gaza Strip for a future state. Israel said it plans to relocate the residents to an area about 12 kilometres (seven miles) away, near the Palestinian village of Abu Dis. The new site is adjacent to a landfill and rights advocates say that a forcible transfer of the residents would violate international law applying to occupied territory. The United Nations and European Union have come out against the plan. Why is Israel ignoring the West Bank protests to lift Gaza sanctions? Most countries regard settlements Israel has built in the West Bank as illegal. Israel disputes this. Khan al-Ahmar's residents belong to the Jahalin tribe of Bedouin who were expelled from southern Israel by the military in the 1950s. Interviewed before the Supreme Court injunction on Thursday, Israeli Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan signalled that the Khan al-Ahmar demolition might not be imminent. Noting the level of international opposition to the move, Erdan told the Ynet news site: "I hope this decision will be implemented in the coming weeks."

Israel has long sought to clear Bedouin from the area between the two settlements, and the Supreme Court approved the demolition in May. Israel police violently attack and evict Palestinians near Jerusalem Removing the Bedouin, human rights groups say, would create a bigger settlement pocket near Jerusalem and make it more difficult for Palestinians to achieve territorial contiguity in the West Bank, a territory they seek along with the Gaza Strip for a future state. Israel said it plans to relocate the residents to an area about 12 kilometres (seven miles) away, near the Palestinian village of Abu Dis. The new site is adjacent to a landfill and rights advocates say that a forcible transfer of the residents would violate international law applying to occupied territory. The United Nations and European Union have come out against the plan. Why is Israel ignoring the West Bank protests to lift Gaza sanctions? Most countries regard settlements Israel has built in the West Bank as illegal. Israel disputes this. Khan al-Ahmar's residents belong to the Jahalin tribe of Bedouin who were expelled from southern Israel by the military in the 1950s. Interviewed before the Supreme Court injunction on Thursday, Israeli Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan signalled that the Khan al-Ahmar demolition might not be imminent. Noting the level of international opposition to the move, Erdan told the Ynet news site: "I hope this decision will be implemented in the coming weeks."

News article:
Israel's Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the demolition of a Palestinian Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank, following growing international concerns over the move. The order, issued on Thursday night, stops the Israeli authorities razing Khan al-Ahmar until at least July 11 to give the state time to respond, according to a copy of the document posted Friday on the court website. "A temporary injunction is hereby granted forbidding the implementation of the demolition orders," it said. Attorney Shlomo Lecker, representing villagers, told AFP that the respite followed a new petition by residents who submitted a planning application to rebuild the village at its present location. The present village consists mainly of makeshift structures of tin and wood, as is generally the case with Bedouin sites. There has been strong international pressure on Israel to reverse its plans to raze Khan al-Ahmar, which the Israeli authorities say was built illegally. In May, the Supreme Court rejected a final appeal against its demolition. Activists say the villagers had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits that are almost never issued to Palestinians in the parts of the West Bank where Israel has full control over civilian affairs. - Diplomatic pressure - Israeli rights activist Angela Godfrey-Goldstein said she believed that diplomatic pressure played a role in the stay of execution. Diplomats from Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the European Union tried Thursday to visit Khan al-Ahmar's school, which is funded by several European countries, but they were turned back at the village entrance. The consul general of France in Jerusalem, Pierre Cochard, told journalists at the scene that demolishing the village of 173 residents would be a violation of the Geneva convention which lays out the obligations of an occupying power toward those under its control. It would also significantly complicate the search for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he added. Police said the area had been declared a closed military zone. The army had said on Thursday that the process of enforcing eviction and demolition orders was under way, but did not give a date when the buildings would be razed. The U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, Jamie McGoldrick, has condemned the move. "These demolitions are particularly outrageous because they target communities who already live in extremely difficult conditions, with high levels of humanitarian needs," he said in a statement on Thursday. Khan al-Ahmar is located near several major Israeli settlements and close to a highway leading to the Dead Sea. Right-wing Israeli NGO Regavim which supports Jewish settlements, called on Friday for the government to press ahead with dismantling the village. "European countries initiated and funded illegal construction throughout this area," it said in a statement. "Adding insult to injury, they now exert completely inappropriate pressure, through radical leftist organizations and the cynical abuse of Israel's judicial system." "The case of Khan al Ahmar has become a litmus test for the State of Israel," it added. "The government must take a firm stand in the face of the pressure campaign that is being waged against it." Activists are concerned that continued Israeli settlement construction in the area could effectively divide the West Bank in two.

News article:
Senior United Nations officials on the ground in the occupied Palestinian territory yesterday urged Israel to halt its demolition of Palestinian properties, expressing "serious concern" over events in Khan Al-Ahmar, a village slated for destruction. Humanitarian Coordinator, Jamie McGoldrick, the Head of West Bank Operations for UNRWA, Scott Anderson, and the Head of the UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights, James Heenan, spoke out as Israeli forces began preparations this week for the planned demolition of Khan Al-Ahmar and the expulsion of its residents. The Israeli Supreme Court – which has previously approved the demolition – yesterday issued a temporary injunction. McGoldrick said: What we are seeing unfold on the ground is deeply disturbing. Demolitions have a devastating impact on families and on communities. He added: "These demolitions are particularly outrageous because they target communities who already live in extremely difficult conditions, with high levels of humanitarian needs. I call again on the Israeli authorities to cease demolitions and other measures that may result in the forcible transfer of Palestinians." Demolition of Khan Al-Ahmar: Another chapter in the ethnic cleansing of Palestine The UN press release noted that "a wave of demolitions across the West Bank in recent days", with 59 Palestinians displaced since 1 July, including 37 children. "The escalation of events in the last few days – the demolitions in Abu Nuwar, the declaration of the Khan Al-Ahmar community as a closed military zone, the violence and large presence of armed Israeli forces – makes life in these communities virtually untenable," said Anderson. "The latest developments are of serious concern as it is evident that they are undertaken with the objective of relocating the concerned communities, as well as causing serious distress to the vulnerable residents who are watching what appear to be preparations for the demolition of their community." 17 Palestinians homeless as Israel demolishes their flats He added: "These pastoral communities are mostly Palestine refugees – originally displaced from their tribal lands in the Negev. They should not be forced to experience a second displacement against their will." "The demolitions in the community will have serious human rights and humanitarian law consequences," said Heenan. "There is high risk of forced evictions of individuals, destruction of private property as well as a dramatic increase in the coercive environment under which the community already lives, in turn raising the risk of forcible transfer."

"The community is terrified that the bulldozers will be back."This community has already suffered so much and the impending threat of demolition is having a huge impact on the psychological wellbeing of the children," she added, noting that Khan al-Ahmar is home to school that serves some 170 Palestinian children living in Bedouin communities in the area.However, Human Rights Watch notes that "the Israeli military refuses to permit most new Palestinian construction in the 60 percent of the West Bank where it has exclusive control over planning and building, even as the military facilitates settler construction".Walid Assaf, head of the National Committee to Resist the Wall and Settlements, credited activists on the ground for the injunction.

News article:
© Shadi Hatem/APA Images The villages Khan al-Ahmar, and Abu Nuwar are home to just around 2,000 Bedouins, but the impact of their removal would be lasting, making a Palestinian state no longer possible, advocates of the two-state solution warned.Today, bulldozers demolished nine homes and three farm buildings in Abu Nuwar and clashed with Bedouin residents in Khan al-Ahmar. According to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society Israeli police injured 35, of whom 4 were hospitalized. Founder of Rabbis for Human Rights, Rabbi Arik Ascherman posted a video of the encounter on social media, writing, "You can see some of the violence at the end of this video. My battery died, and I didn't get the worst of it. The police were swinging wildly and kicking viciously, until their commanding officer got a hold of them."Activists on the ground say they fear the demolitions of the towns will be completed overnight, in darkness and after media and European consular officials, who were on site today, head home.Angela Godfrey-Goldstein who heads the group Jahalin Solidarity told Mondoweiss, "This demolition is Trump's gift to Netanyahu for July Fourth. But it has backfired. I don't think Trump understands what he has set in motion, which is why it's so dangerous." She warned the eviction would move Israel onto a path of "full fledged apartheid statehood, with no sustainable future ahead. SoAlso this morning Israeli authorities were spotted at Jabal West with construction materials. Jabal West is a proposed relocation site outfitted with an apartment building and buffered by a city dump. Spokesperson for the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem Amit Gilutz said in a statement that demolishing the Bedouin towns and then moving them to another location constitutes forcible transfer, a violation of international law."No military order or court ruling can make the transfer of these residents lawful or moral. Forcible transfer of Palestinian communities is a war crime, and all who are involved in approving or implementing it bear personal liability," Gilutz said.While demolitions were on-going today the UK's Parliament met for an emergency discussion on the demolitions. Lawmakers from Britain's Labour party called for a decisive response, weighing recognizing Palestinian statehood and banning trade with Israeli companies that operate in the settlements.Labour party parliamentarian Richard Burden said, "Speaking plainly, it is state sponsored theft. A theft that will cut the West Bank into two, making a continuous Palestinian state near impossible and the prospects of a two state solution so more remote."Bedouins Khan al-Ahmar and Abu Nuwar are from the Jahalin tribe, Palestinian herders and shepherds who lived in lands that became southern Israel until the 1950s. At that time Israel's military government transferred them to the hilltops outside of Jerusalem, where they live today."Words of warning to Israel are not enough. If there is no serious intervention from the international community towards the Israeli government and its belligerent military occupation, other villages will be next, and more Palestinian men, women and children will be displaced for another 70 years to come," she said.

He added: "The two houses were part of the city's plan and we had documents for this. We started the procedures to get the licenses, but we were surprised with demolition orders."

Israel demolished two houses belonging to Arabs in the city of Qalansawa and are to demolish 50 more under the pretext that they were built without the necessary planning consents, Safa News Agency reported. During a meeting held by the High Follow Up Committee for Arab Citizens of in Israel, engineer Nadi Al-Taya said two houses belonging to the Warda family had been levelled and the demolition of 50 more was underway.

Al-Taya said that Israel does this in order to the Arab population while encouraging Jewish expansionism. Head of the Follow Up Committee Mohamed Baraka said: "The crime which took place this morning [demolition of the two houses] is an extension of the crimes of the Israeli authorities in Umm Al-Fahm, Ar'ara and Jajoulia."

News article:
The High Court of Justice agreed on Thursday to hold a hearing on a petition filed by residents of Khan al-Ahmar against the state’s decision to demolish the Bedouin village near the West Bank settlement of Ma’ale Adumim. The top legal body ordered that a hearing on the matter be held by August 15, meaning the demotion of the hamlet — originally green-lighted by the court in May — will be further delayed until after the session takes place and a decision is handed down. In the beginning of July, the state began its preparations to raze the village, where none of the structures have been granted permits. Security forces were deployed to the village and construction workers began paving an access road that would facilitate the demolition and evacuation. With the eviction appearing just days away, attorneys representing Khan al-Ahmar submitted an urgent petition last Wednesday that claimed the Civil Administration — the Defense Ministry body in charge of construction permits in the West Bank — never offered any plans to legalize the village, and refused to review a plan submitted by the villagers. The High Court ordered the state to respond to the petition, which it did earlier this week. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms In its response, the state argued that the Supreme Court, in its initial ruling, discussed the option of legalizing the village but ultimately ruled against it. Moreover, the state claimed that village leaders had themselves never submitted any plans for the Civil Administration’s approval. In light of that response, the High Court had the option to either accept the claims of the state by rejecting the Khan al-Ahmar petition or hold a hearing to gain more clarity on the matter. It chose to do the latter, giving some weight to the claims of the Bedouin residents. An additional petition was filed on Monday by the same group of attorneys representing the village. That appeal claimed that no eviction orders were ever filed against the residents, as required before any village is cleared. Instead, the Palestinian attorneys asserted that only demolition orders were submitted. Advertisement In response to the petition, the High Court issued a temporary injunction preventing the state from carrying out its plans to evacuate Khan al-Ahmar, and ordered the state to respond by July 16. Also offering the village a reprieve, the Defense Ministry body responsible for overseeing the demolition announced that it was going on strike beginning next Sunday, due to what it says is the Finance Ministry’s failure to implement improvements to workers’ pension plans promised nearly three years ago. In their letter announcing the indefinite strike, the Civil Administration committee stated that among the projects that will not be carried out prior to their return to work is the Khan al-Ahmar evacuation. Residents say this means they will be able to begin the new school year in the village on July 15 as originally planned. The hamlet has gained international attention for its school buildings made from tires, mud, and used cooking oil due to Israeli restrictions on construction. After a years-long legal battle, the Supreme Court approved the demolition of Khan al-Ahmar in May. The state says the structures, mostly makeshift shacks and tents, were built without the relevant building permits and pose a threat to the village residents because of their proximity to a highway. But activists say the villagers — who have lived at the site, then in Jordan, since the 1950s, after the state evicted them from their Negev homes — had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, as they are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank, such as Khan al-Ahmar, where Israel has full control over civilian affairs. Advertisement Israel has pledged to resettle the residents, whom the UN says number 180 people. Israel says it has offered the residents an alternative location, near a garbage dump belonging to the nearby Palestinian town of Abu Dis. But the villagers say the location is unsuitable for their way of life, and have also said residents of Abu Dis have warned them to stay away. Opponents of the demolition also argue that it is part of an effort to enable the expansion of the nearby settlement of Kfar Adumim, and to create a region of contiguous Israeli control from Jerusalem almost to the Dead Sea, a move critics say will bisect the West Bank, and make a contiguous Palestinian state impossible. Last week, the IDF issued orders authorizing the seizure of access roads to the village. Heavy demolition equipment has since been moved there, and last Thursday bulldozers could be seen widening the access road to the village, feeding speculation that a road was being prepared to facilitate the evacuation and demolition. On the day prior, clashes broke out between police and protesters at the village. Residents and activists attempted to block construction equipment from advancing, leading to violent scuffles. Police said in a statement that 11 people were arrested during disturbances at the site, and that rocks were thrown at officers. Israeli rights group B’Tselem said the detainees included the organization’s own head of field research. Two of demonstrators were released shortly thereafter. Advertisement On Sunday, an Ofer Military Court judge ordered the conditional release of eight more Palestinians. On Thursday, the judge ordered the last suspect, who is accused of throwing stones at troops, be released to house arrest.

The image shows two Israeli security personnel looking down at the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar, which is located in the West Bank. The village is slated for demolition by the Israeli government, which says that the structures were built without the proper permits. The residents of the village say that they have been living there for decades and that they have never been given the opportunity to obtain permits. The image is complementary to the news events set because it provides a visual representation of the situation in Khan al-Ahmar. The image shows the village's proximity to the Israeli settlement of Ma'ale Adumim, as well as the security forces that are deployed in the area.

Israel's Supreme Court has postponed until mid-August the Israeli authorities' planned demolition of Khan Al-Ahmar, a Palestinian village in the occupied West Bank. Last week, the court issued an injunction against the demolition, after villagers said their efforts to secure retroactive building permits had been ignored by the Israeli authorities. Israel systematically denies such permits to Palestinian residents of "Area C" of the West Bank, at the same time as encouraging the growth of settlements built in contravention of international law. Yesterday, according to agency reports, the court summoned both sides for a session by 15 August, "effectively putting the demolitions on hold". Demolition of Khan Al-Ahmar: Another chapter in the ethnic cleansing of Palestine Israel intends to forcibly displace Khan Al-Ahmar's residents, as part of a long-standing plan to expand nearby Israeli settlements. Israel's policy of demolitions and displacement are grave violations of its responsibilities as an occupying power, and human rights groups have said the destruction of Khan al-Ahmar will amount to a war crime.

© via Twitter the razing of Khan al-Ahmar and the forcible transfer of its population are war crimes. © Reuters The elephant in the room is Israel itself - and its enduring bad faith. Jonathan Cook won the Martha Gellhorn Special Prize for Journalism. His books include Israel and the Clash of Civilisations: Iraq, Iran and the Plan to Remake the Middle East (Pluto Press) and Disappearing Palestine: Israel's Experiments in Human Despair (Zed Books). He contributed this article to PalestineChronicle.com. Visit: www.jonathan-cook.net. Israel finally built an access road to the West Bank village of Khan al-Ahmar last week, after half a century of delays.If one community has come to symbolize the demise of the two-state solution, it is Khan al-Ahmar.It was for that reason that a posse of European diplomats left their air-conditioned offices late last week to trudge through the hot, dusty hills outside Jerusalem and witness for themselves the preparations for the village's destruction. That included the Israeli police viciously beating residents and supporters as they tried to block the advance of heavy machinery.Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain have submitted a formal protest. Their denunciations echoed those of more than 70 Democratic lawmakers in Washington in May - a rare example of US politicians showing solidarity with Palestinians.It would be gratifying to believe that Western governments care about the inhabitants of Khan al-Ahmar - or the thousands of other Palestinians who are being incrementally cleansed by Israel from nearby lands but whose plight has drawn far less attention.After all,But in truth, Western politicians are more concerned about propping up the illusion of a peace process that expired many years ago than the long-running abuse of Palestinians under Israeli occupation.Western capitals understand what is at stake. Israel wants Khan al-Ahmar gone so that Jewish settlements can be built in its place, on land it has designated as "E1".That would put the final piece in place for Israel to build a substantial bloc of new settler homes to sever the West Bank in two.The erasure of Khan al-Ahmar has not arrived out of nowhere. Israel has trampled on international law for decades, conducting a form of creeping annexation that has provoked little more than uncomfortable shifting in chairs from Western politicians.Khan al-Ahmar's Bedouin inhabitants, from the Jahalin tribe, have been ethnically cleansedby Israel, but these war crimes went unnoticed.The first time was in the 1950s, a few years after Israel's creation, when 80 percent of Palestinians had been driven from their homes to clear the path for the creation of a Jewish state.Although they should have enjoyed the protection of Israeli citizenship, the Jahalin were forced out of the Negev and into the West Bank, then controlled by Jordan, to make way for new Jewish immigrants.A generation later in 1967, when they had barely re-established themselves, the Jahalin were again under attack from Israeli soldiers occupying the West Bank. The grazing lands the Jahalin had relocated to with their goats and sheep were seized to build a settlement for Jews only, Kfar Adumim, in violation of the laws of war.Ever since the Jahalin have dwelt in a twilight zone of Israeli-defined "illegality". Like other Palestinians in the 60 percent of the West Bank declared under Israeli control by the Oslo peace process, they have been denied building permits, forcing three generations to live in tin shacks and tents.Israel has also refused to connect the village to the water, electricity and sewage grids, in an attempt to make life so unbearable the Jahalin would opt to leave.When an Italian charity helped in 2009 to establish Khan al-Ahmar's first school - made from mud and tires - Israel stepped up its legal battle to demolish the village.Now, the Jahalin are about to be driven from their lands again, as though they are nothing more than wayward cattle. This time they are to be forcibly resettled next to a waste dump by the Palestinian town of Abu Dis, hemmed in on all sides by Israeli walls and settlements.In the new location, they will be forced to abandon their pastoral way of life. As a resident, Ibrahim Abu Dawoud observed: "For us, leaving the desert is death."In another indication of the Palestinians' dire predicament, the Trump administration is expected to propose in its long-awaited peace plan that the slum-like Abu Dis, rather than East Jerusalem, serve as the capital of a future pseudo-Palestinian state - if Israel ever chooses to recognize one.Khan al-Ahmar's destruction would be the first demolition of a complete Palestinian community since the 1990s when Israel ostensibly committed to the Oslo process.. It wants to annex the lands on which villages like Khan al-Ahmar stand and remove their Palestinian populations.There is a minor hurdle. Last Thursday, the Israeli supreme court tried to calm the storm clouds gathering in Europe by issuing a temporary injunction on the demolition works.The reprieve is likely to be short-lived. A few weeks ago the same court - in a panel dominated by judges identified with the settler movement - backed Khan al-Ahmar's destruction.The Supreme Court has also been moving towards accepting the Israeli government's argument that decades of land grabs by settlers should be retroactively sanctioned - even though they violate Israeli and international law - if carried out in "good faith".Whatever the judges believe, there is nothing "good faith" about the behavior of either the settlers or Israel's government towards communities like Khan al-Ahmar.Saeb Erekat, the Palestinians' veteran peace negotiator, recently warned that Israel and the US were close to "liquidating" the project of Palestinian statehood.Sounding more desperate than usual, the Europe Union reaffirmed this month its commitment to a two-state solution, while urging that the "obstacles" to its realization be more clearly identified.As Khan al-Ahmar demonstrates all too clearly, there will be no end to the slow-motion erasure of Palestinian communities until western governments find the nerve to impose biting sanctions on Israel.

Israel has trampled on international law for decades, conducting a form of creeping annexation that has provoked little more than uncomfortable shifting in chairs from Western politicians.Khan al-Ahmar's Bedouin inhabitants, from the Jahalin tribe, have been ethnically cleansedby Israel, but these war crimes went unnoticed.The first time was in the 1950s, a few years after Israel's creation, when 80 percent of Palestinians had been driven from their homes to clear the path for the creation of a Jewish state.Although they should have enjoyed the protection of Israeli citizenship, the Jahalin were forced out of the Negev and into the West Bank, then controlled by Jordan, to make way for new Jewish immigrants.A generation later in 1967, when they had barely re-established themselves, the Jahalin were again under attack from Israeli soldiers occupying the West Bank. The grazing lands the Jahalin had relocated to with their goats and sheep were seized to build a settlement for Jews only, Kfar Adumim, in violation of the laws of war.Ever since the Jahalin have dwelt in a twilight zone of Israeli-defined "illegality". Like other Palestinians in the 60 percent of the West Bank declared under Israeli control by the Oslo peace process, they have been denied building permits, forcing three generations to live in tin shacks and tents.Israel has also refused to connect the village to the water, electricity and sewage grids, in an attempt to make life so unbearable the Jahalin would opt to leave.When an Italian charity helped in 2009 to establish Khan al-Ahmar's first school - made from mud and tires - Israel stepped up its legal battle to demolish the village.Now, the Jahalin are about to be driven from their lands again, as though they are nothing more than wayward cattle.

News article:
Firefighters were working to put out three large fires along the Gaza Strip border, believed to have been started by incendiary kites flown from the coastal enclave on Saturday. The largest fire was near to Kibbutz Carmia, adjacent to the northern Gaza Strip. Preliminary estimates suggested that between 2,000 to 3,000 dunam (500 to 740 acres) of fields and parts of a nature reserve adjacent to the kibbutz were destroyed. Officials at the Israel Nature and Parks Authority estimated that at least one third of the Carmia reserve had been destroyed. Residents were working alongside with firefighters to try to contain the fires that have become almost daily occurrences since the start of the “March of Return” protests along the border at the end of March. During the protests, Gazans have been flying kites into Israel outfitted with Molotov cocktails and containers of burning fuel, setting fire to large swaths of land. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms It has become a widely adopted tactic during the weekly “March of Return” clashes on the Gaza border, which Israel accuses the Hamas terror group of orchestrating as a cover for attacks and attempts to breach the border fence. Firefighters were also working to gain control of a blaze near Kibbutz Be’eri, which borders the central Gaza Strip. Earlier Saturday, an additional fire had broke out in fields belonging to Kibbutz Nir Am also along the northern Gaza Strip. Advertisement [mappress mapid=”6384″] On Thursday, firefighters battled similar brush fires between the Kissufim and Ein Hashlosha kibbutzim that authorities suspect were caused by firebomb-laden kites flown across the security fence by Palestinians. Local residents told Israel Radio they were concerned that they would not be provided compensation for the damage, as the burden for proving they were victims of a terror attack fell on them. Zionist Union MK Eitan Brosh told the radio that lawmakers from his party would tour the area Sunday and work to provide the residents with solutions to their ongoing distress. The violent demonstrations were meant to end on May 15, but Hamas leaders have said they want them to continue. Advertisement In the past month, at least 300 attack kites have been flown across the border, starting hundreds of fires and causing an estimated tens of millions of shekels’ worth of damages.

News article:
Firefighters were working to put out three large fires along the Gaza Strip border, believed to have been started by incendiary kites flown from the coastal enclave on Saturday. The largest fire was near to Kibbutz Carmia, adjacent to the northern Gaza Strip. Preliminary estimates suggested that between 2,000 to 3,000 dunam (500 to 740 acres) of fields and parts of a nature reserve adjacent to the kibbutz were destroyed. Officials at the Israel Nature and Parks Authority estimated that at least one third of the Carmia reserve had been destroyed. Residents were working alongside with firefighters to try to contain the fires that have become almost daily occurrences since the start of the “March of Return” protests along the border at the end of March. During the protests, Gazans have been flying kites into Israel outfitted with Molotov cocktails and containers of burning fuel, setting fire to large swaths of land.

News article:
Jerusalem – Teams of firefighters worked throughout the day on Sunday putting out large brush fires in fields belonging to communities in southern Israel, after they had been hit by flaming-kites launched from the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. Hundreds of acres of land was burnt near the communities of Nir Am, Or Haner and Be’eri after one such kite triggered a fire in the Sha’ar Hanegev Regional Council’s Simhoni Forest. The fire caused the southbound lane of Route 34 to be closed to traffic, and Israel Railways shut down the Ashkelon-Netivot route, stopping trains coming from the north at Ashkelon railway station and trains coming from the south at the Netivot station. The fires came a day after some 500 to 750 acres of a nature reserve next to Kibbutz Carmiya were destroyed by kites. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he instructed National Security Adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat to push forward a process that will subtract the amount of money the government must pay to Gaza-area communities for the damages caused by the fires, from the Palestinian tax money Israel transfers each month to the Palestinian Authority. According to Hebrew media, Israel Nature and Parks estimates that at least one-third of the reserve was destroyed on Saturday, despite four air tankers and 12 firefighting teams working to put out the flames. Gazans have been protesting along the border since March 30 as part of the Great March of Return, with demonstrators throwing stones and Molotov cocktails towards troops and launching incendiary kites and balloons towards Israeli territory. Late Saturday night, the Israel Air Force attacked 15 Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip following mortar fire against southern Israeli communities on Saturday evening. The military said the strikes were a response to the earlier rocket fire as well as “terror incidents led and made possible by the Hamas terror organization over the course of the weekend,” which included the throwing of grenades, improvised explosive devices, attempts to infiltrate into Israel by damaging the security fence and the burning of Israeli fields by incendiary kites. The mortar fire was the first violation of a fragile cease-fire and two days of relative quiet in southern Israel after the most significant escalation between the IDF and the terrorist groups in the coastal enclave in four years. The first round of sirens was activated Saturday in several nearby communities in the Eshkol Regional Council at around 8 p.m., with one mortar falling in open territory and the other intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system. Additional sirens sounded several times in the same communities, as well as in communities within the Sha’ar Hanegev and Hof Asheklon regions and in the city of Sderot, following additional rocket fire from the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. According to the military, the IAF bombed targets across the entire Gaza Strip in three Hamas compounds, including two weapon-production and storage sites, as well as targets belonging to Hamas’s naval force. If Hamas “chooses to follow a path of terrorism and not solve the difficulties of the people of Gaza, it will continue to pay a heavy price that will only become steeper as much as needed,” read the statement released by the IDF. The Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that residential homes were damaged when Israeli jets targeted one site in the al-Waha area northwest of Gaza City with three missiles. The Hamas-affiliated Shehab news agency reported that Israeli jets struck targets in Gaza City’s Shejaia neighborhood as well as in the Nuseirat refugee camp near Deir al-Bireh. Another target was struck outside the southern Gazan city of Rafah. Earlier in the evening, Israeli jets bombed locations in the al-Zaytoun neighborhood of Gaza City as well as targets in Khan Yunis and Rafah. Meanwhile, the IDF announced Sunday morning that a large scale exercise across the southern part of the country would begin despite the heightened tensions in the area. Residents of southern Israel should expect to see an increased presence of troops as well as military equipment and aircraft in the skies over southern Israel. The drill, which will last throughout Wednesday, was planned in advance “to preserve the fitness and preparedness of the troops,” the military said. The Israel Air Force will also be holding a separate drill throughout the country that is set to last until Thursday.

News article:
Firefighters were dispatched Tuesday morning to the Gaza border area after flaming kites were sent soaring over the border, causing at least three fires in Israeli territory, ahead of expected violent demonstrations along the Strip’s security fence. Two large fires broke out near Kibbutz Nir Am, northeast of the Gaza Strip, while the third was reported in the area of Moshav Netiv Ha’asara, to the north. Since the “March of Return” protests began along the Gaza border at the end of March, hundreds of kites and helium balloons have been flown into Israel outfitted with Molotov cocktails and containers of burning fuel, setting fire to large swaths of land. A large blaze was reported south of Nir Am, across the street from the nearby town of Sderot’s Sapir College. Footage from the scene, filmed by a student, showed the fire spreading rapidly as firetrucks were heard rushing to the scene. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The fire forced authorities to temporarily close down the Route 232 highway in southern Israel until the flames could be brought under control, according to a spokesperson for the local Sha’ar Hanegev regional council. The road later reopened. The second fire outside Nir Am broke out in nearby grazing lands, according to the Sha’ar Hanegev spokesperson. The military anticipated that large protests would take place on Tuesday along the security fence to commemorate what Palestinians refer to as the Naksa, or setback, of Israel’s victory in the 1967 Six Day War, which brought East Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights under Israeli control. Advertisement Firefighters, soldiers and local residents have worked on an almost daily basis to try to contain fires in Israeli fields ignited by the burning kites. On Sunday, the heads of the local governments in the Gaza periphery sent a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and Interior Minister Arye Deri calling for increased investment in the area in light of the precarious security situation. “In the past week, including last night, almost 200 mortar shells and Qassam rockets have landed in Gaza periphery communities, serving as a painful reminder that the Gaza periphery must manage a fragile and complicated way of life, under constant threat to its residents,” the local mayors wrote. Israeli officials have said that since the start of the protests at the Gaza border, there have been more than 200 fires in the Gaza periphery, destroying some 17,500 dunams (4,300 acres) of land, the majority of it in nature reserves and parks. According to the Nature and Parks Authority, approximately 10,000 dunams in parks and reserves in southern Israel were burned, though a spokesperson for the authority said investigations were still underway to determine exactly how much of that was caused by incendiary kites and balloons, and how much was from other sources. On Saturday, a blaze devastated the Carmia nature reserve in southern Israel Israel, in what officials said was the worst day of fires since the demonstrators adopted the fire kite tactics a few months ago. Advertisement Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan said Tuesday that Israel should initiate a program of targeted assassinations against those who fly burning kites from Gaza to Israel, as well as Hamas commanders. “The fact that Hamas is the one enabling the shooting and the sending of the kites means we must return to targeted assassinations, and the kite-launchers and Hamas commanders should be targeted for killing,” said Erdan during a visit to the southern Israeli town of Sderot. On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered that funds be withheld from the Palestinian Authority to compensate Israeli farmers living on the Gaza border who had their agricultural lands destroyed. Israel’s Tax Authority said the agricultural damage alone stood at NIS 5 million ($1.4 million) and that damage caused to nature reserves and other land could drive up the figure. President Reuven Rivlin called PA President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday and asked him to condemn the airborne arson attacks on the Gaza border and attempts to cross into Israel. “The terror coming from Gaza is a problem for both sides and we should hear your voice on this matter,” Rivlin said, according to Hebrew media reports. “We have to see how to stop the arson and infiltration of the border fence.”

News article:
Firefighters were dispatched Tuesday morning to the Gaza border area after flaming kites were sent soaring over the border, causing at least three fires in Israeli territory, ahead of expected violent demonstrations along the Strip’s security fence. Two large fires broke out near Kibbutz Nir Am, northeast of the Gaza Strip, while the third was reported in the area of Moshav Netiv Ha’asara, to the north. Since the “March of Return” protests began along the Gaza border at the end of March, hundreds of kites and helium balloons have been flown into Israel outfitted with Molotov cocktails and containers of burning fuel, setting fire to large swaths of land. A large blaze was reported south of Nir Am, across the street from the nearby town of Sderot’s Sapir College. Footage from the scene, filmed by a student, showed the fire spreading rapidly as firetrucks were heard rushing to the scene. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The fire forced authorities to temporarily close down the Route 232 highway in southern Israel until the flames could be brought under control, according to a spokesperson for the local Sha’ar Hanegev regional council. The road later reopened. The second fire outside Nir Am broke out in nearby grazing lands, according to the Sha’ar Hanegev spokesperson. The military anticipated that large protests would take place on Tuesday along the security fence to commemorate what Palestinians refer to as the Naksa, or setback, of Israel’s victory in the 1967 Six Day War, which brought East Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights under Israeli control. Advertisement Firefighters, soldiers and local residents have worked on an almost daily basis to try to contain fires in Israeli fields ignited by the burning kites. On Sunday, the heads of the local governments in the Gaza periphery sent a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and Interior Minister Arye Deri calling for increased investment in the area in light of the precarious security situation. “In the past week, including last night, almost 200 mortar shells and Qassam rockets have landed in Gaza periphery communities, serving as a painful reminder that the Gaza periphery must manage a fragile and complicated way of life, under constant threat to its residents,” the local mayors wrote. Israeli officials have said that since the start of the protests at the Gaza border, there have been more than 200 fires in the Gaza periphery, destroying some 17,500 dunams (4,300 acres) of land, the majority of it in nature reserves and parks. According to the Nature and Parks Authority, approximately 10,000 dunams in parks and reserves in southern Israel were burned, though a spokesperson for the authority said investigations were still underway to determine exactly how much of that was caused by incendiary kites and balloons, and how much was from other sources. On Saturday, a blaze devastated the Carmia nature reserve in southern Israel Israel, in what officials said was the worst day of fires since the demonstrators adopted the fire kite tactics a few months ago. Advertisement Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan said Tuesday that Israel should initiate a program of targeted assassinations against those who fly burning kites from Gaza to Israel, as well as Hamas commanders. “The fact that Hamas is the one enabling the shooting and the sending of the kites means we must return to targeted assassinations, and the kite-launchers and Hamas commanders should be targeted for killing,” said Erdan during a visit to the southern Israeli town of Sderot. On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered that funds be withheld from the Palestinian Authority to compensate Israeli farmers living on the Gaza border who had their agricultural lands destroyed. Israel’s Tax Authority said the agricultural damage alone stood at NIS 5 million ($1.4 million) and that damage caused to nature reserves and other land could drive up the figure. President Reuven Rivlin called PA President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday and asked him to condemn the airborne arson attacks on the Gaza border and attempts to cross into Israel. “The terror coming from Gaza is a problem for both sides and we should hear your voice on this matter,” Rivlin said, according to Hebrew media reports. “We have to see how to stop the arson and infiltration of the border fence.”

News article:
Kibbutz Nir Am – After years of rocket attacks and militant infiltrations from Gaza, residents of southern Israel are now coping with a new kind of threat: incendiary kites and balloons that have damaged farmlands and nature reserves. The crude devices launched by Palestinians inside the blockaded territory have not been lethal. But they have sparked fires that have damaged agriculture, killed wildlife and whipped up considerable indignation. “It’s caused significant economic damage but more than that it is emotional,” said Itzik Ebbo, 78, a member of Kibbutz Nir Am, a collective farming community. “These are crops we poured our hearts into. These are fields we hiked with our children and grandchildren.” Sullen locals have become a fixture on Israeli TV, guiding reporters around smoldering fields and lamenting the loss of life among snakes, turtles and the like. The phenomenon is the latest twist in nearly three months of intermittent Palestinian border protests. To many Israelis the “kite terrorism” is yet more evidence of implacable — and creative — Palestinian hostility. But viewed another way it is a desperate ploy on behalf of the 2 million Palestinians largely penned into the impoverished seaside strip. A decade-old blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt to weaken Gaza’s ruling Hamas militant group has ravaged the local economy and caused widespread despair. Israeli forces have killed more than 120 Palestinians and wounded over 3,800 since the protests began on March 30. Israel says it’s the only way to prevent mass breaches of the border that would include militants. But the vast majority of the Palestinian casualties have been unarmed, drawing heavy international criticism of Israel’s open-fire orders. Israel blames Gaza’s militant Hamas rulers for the bloodshed. Drifting aimlessly over the border, the kites have caused more than 450 fires over the past month, torching some 7,000 acres (2,800 hectares) of land and causing some $2 million in damages. Israel says it plans to deduct from tax funds it collects for the Palestinians to compensate farmers, and the military has been stepping up its measures in recent days by firing warning shots at launchers. Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman vowed Monday that “kite terrorism cannot continue.” But Israel’s decision-makers must also consider the risk of sparking all-out war, as happened four years ago. Israel accuses Hamas, a militant group that seeks its destruction, of using the protesters as cover in an effort to engineer violent infiltrations. The current round of violence has yet to claim any serious Israeli casualties. Israel’s Iron Dome defense system has neutralized much of the rocket fire. A nearly-completed underground barrier and new technological means have thwarted or destroyed much of the Hamas tunnel network. But Israel has struggled with the low-tech kites and balloons drifting over the border. Gazans began flying kites with burning rags or cotton-stuffed cans attached to them several weeks ago and have since added helium-filled balloons with incendiary material attached. Aided by the hot and windy conditions, the devices have dropped in dry brush, destroying wheat and sunflower fields and sending animals scurrying away. Palestinian activists argue such economic damage is not unlike that caused to them by the blockade. The launchers seem to take pride in their project. One of the leaders, an 18-year-old who asked to withhold his name for fear of Israel targeting him, said it started with bored teens flying Palestinian flags. “We wanted to provoke the Israelis more, so we attached a burning rag to the kite. Thanks to God’s will, the thread was cut and the kite fell on the other side and started a fire. This is how we got the idea,” he said, adding that a kite only cost $1 to make and a balloon just 50 cents. “Unless there are 15 to 20 fires, we don’t consider this a good day,” he added. The military says drones intercept some 90 percent of the devices and it has also fired shots near kite launchers, targeting what it says are vehicles and Hamas posts used to launch the kites. “These are not toys. These are dangerous weapons that are used in order to terrorize Israeli civilians,” said Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman. Conricus would not comment on calls by hard-line government ministers to kill kite launchers on the spot, as Israel does to those firing rockets. Meanwhile the fires rage daily. Terrain along the border is pockmarked with black spots of scorched hillsides and charred palm trees. In Nir Am, which abuts Gaza’s northeast border, the fires have inched dangerously close to adjacent train tracks and a gas station. Residents and visiting firefighting crews are on standby to deploy at a moment’s notice. “Balloons and kites should be something fun, not something to avoid,” said Betty Gavri, 77. In an effort to shift the narrative, kibbutz residents and their children recently floated colorful balloons and kites toward Gaza in what they said was a message of peace. They’ve also begun a replanting drive to replace the damaged fields. But Gavri is skeptical much will improve until larger changes in the region take place and the lives of Palestinians in Gaza improve as well. “I’m convinced that until they have something to lose there won’t be a big change on our doorstep,” she said. Kobi Sofer, a ranger for Israel’s Nature and Parks Authority, said vegetation could rebound relatively quickly but it will likely take many years, if at all, for the entire ecosystem of plants, predators and prey to recover. Sofer says he has seen scorched porcupines, snakes, turtles, lizards and other rodents and insects, not to mention their feeding grounds. Touring the area, the only animals in sight were birds pecking at charred carcasses. “All the years of rocket fire and military maneuvering never left anything like this,” said Sofer, a 17-year veteran ranger, as he gestured toward a scorched hilltop overlooking Gaza. “It’s a helpless feeling.”

Fresh fires broke out Sunday in Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip as a result of flaming airborne devices launched from the Palestinian enclave. Firefighters extinguished the fire near Kibbutz Kissufim and were working to put out a pair of blazes near the farming communities of Be’eri and Nir Am. Earlier in the day, a suspicious balloon landed in the yard of a home in the southern city of Sderot, police said. Police said officers arrived at the house and closed off the area following a report from a Sderot resident who saw the balloon land. Police sappers were called to the scene to inspect the suspicious object. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Sunday’s fires came a day after flaming objects flown from Gaza started 26 blazes in southern Israel. Palestinian media reported that Israeli military aircraft fired warning shots on Saturday near a group of Palestinians in Gaza launching incendiary devices toward Israel. There were no reported injuries as a result of the warning shots east of Gaza City. Advertisement Since March 30, Palestinians in Gaza have launched hundreds of kites and helium balloons bearing flammable materials, and occasionally explosives, sparking near-daily fires that have burned thousands of acres of land in southern Israel. The Israeli military has carried out multiple warning strikes in recent weeks at groups of Gazans preparing to launch incendiary devices toward Israel. The army has said repeatedly that it will act to prevent the launch of the airborne incendiary devices and explosives. Israeli leaders on Wednesday evening warned the Hamas terrorist group, which rules Gaza, and other terror groups in the Strip, that the military was prepared to take more intense offensive action as well. “The intensity will increase as necessary,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a graduation ceremony for new IDF officers. “We are prepared for every scenario, and it’s best that our enemies understand this right now.” “The steel fist of the IDF will strike hard at anyone who attempts to harm us,” he added. Israeli leaders were split on how to respond to those responsible for the airborne arson attacks, with some calling for the IDF to shoot the kite flyers and balloon launchers on sight, while others argued that this was a step too far.
