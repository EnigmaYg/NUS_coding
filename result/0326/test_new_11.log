News article:
ISLAMABAD: Senate Chairman Mian Raza Rabbani on Sunday said Pakistan was a sovereign country and it was not in the habit of "taking notices" from anyone. "Trump in his recently announced South Asia policy, had blamed Pakistan for the US failures in Afghanistan. The US is trying to shift the blame for its defeat in Afghanistan to Pakistan, and it consistently refuses to recognize the sacrifices of the people of Pakistan in the war on terror,” he said while addressing the six-nation first Speakers Conference that got under way here under the theme of ‘Challenges of terrorism and inter-regional connectivity’. Representatives from Russia, China, Iran, Afghanistan and Turkey are in attendance. The conference was also addressed by Speaker National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Speaker of Wolesi Jirga of Afghanistan Abdul Rauf Ibraheemi, Speaker of the Shoora-e-Islami of Iran Dr Ali Larejani, Chairman of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of Russia Volodin Vyacheslav Viktorovich, Speaker of Grand Turkish Assembly Ismail Kehrman and Vice Chairman of the National People’s Congress of China Zhang Ping. Referring to the recent remarks about Pakistan by US Vice President Mike Pence, Rabbani said, “Pakistan does not need to heed any ‘notice’ from a foreign nation. We will never sacrifice on our basic rights as a sovereign country.” Rabbani said the US had pursued a policy of "regime change and bringing about instability in Muslim countries," particularly in the Middle East. Describing Trump's decision to shift the US embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem the "blunder of all blunders", the chairman said Washington had failed to understand that it was neither supported practically, nor by history in their decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital. He said the United Nations General Assembly had given a befitting reply to Washington when 128 countries rejected the US move. "What they [US] fail to recognise is that the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital will give rise to a new intifada, as the people of Palestine move to achieve their historic rights,” he added. He said a new coalition of the US, Israel and India was in the making, adding, "We find the US is trying to use or build up India as a policeman of the region." He said though Pakistan believed in dialogue and friendly relations with its neighbours, unless India was willing to speak on equal terms, ‘we will perhaps just be looking at the mirage of peace in the region.’ He said it was unfortunate that the United Nations had failed to implement its resolutions on Kashmir. “Time has come for Asia to make its own decisions, or else the history will never forgive us,” he added. Talking about the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), he said it had the potential to transform the economic fortunes of the region, ushering in a new era of prosperity. He said the One Belt One Road (OBOR) project will not only benefit the Pakistan, but also the whole region. Addressing the conference, President Mamnoon Hussain said terrorism was not a local phenomenon rather it was caused by interference of foreign powers. “Pakistan had been dragged into the war-quagmire after the tragic 9/11 incident,” he said, adding that law and order in Pakistan was adversely affected following the 9/11. Mamnoon said terrorism had created immense problems in several countries of the region, with Pakistan being the most affected. He said during the last few years, Pakistan had lost more than 70,000 precious lives to terrorism besides suffering more than $120 billion financial losses. He said owing to comprehensive steps to cope with the situation, terrorists had received a deadly blow. “We have taken comprehensive steps under the National Action Plan (NAP) in different parts of the country, while an effective action has been taken in tribal areas under operation Zarb-e-Azb,” he said. Talking about the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), he said as a result of untiring efforts by the two countries, the economic corridor was about to start functioning and would enable western China, particularly the Central Asian countries, to access other parts of Asia and larger markets of Africa and European countries through the Arabian Sea. “Pakistan is engaged in best efforts to materialise this great dream because we think the future of these regions lies hidden in active links, mutual trade and cooperation into which CPEC will infuse new spirit. Under this spirit, we sincerely invite all countries of the region to join the economic corridor,” the president said. However, he said economic stability and prosperity of the region was linked with regional peace and stability, peaceful co-existence and mutual respect. He said under this spirit, Pakistan had extended sincere and unconditional cooperation for peace and stability in Afghanistan, believing that stability in the region was linked with the stability in Afghanistan. “To achieve this common aspiration, we will cooperate in every serious effort,” he said. Similarly, he said Pakistan had extended full cooperation to neighbouring countries to improve and make the border security effective to control extremism. He said in order to combat terrorism, Pakistan’s armed forces had special experience and specialty from which its neighbour countries could benefit. Talking about the bone of contention between Pakistan and India, President Mamnoon said breach of people’s right to self-determination and fundamental rights created a number of problems and the Kashmir dispute was a glaring example. He said Pakistan was of the opinion that this issue had endangered peace in the Sub-continent. Welcoming guests to the federal capital, the president hoped that the conference would prove extremely beneficial in combating the challenges facing the region as well as utilizing the opportunities for regional development and prosperity. Mamnoon said geography, common values of opinions and similar conditions provide Pakistan, Iran, China, Turkey, Russia and Afghanistan wider opportunities to work in unison for the development and prosperity of their people. APP adds: Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said the Pakistani economy had suffered a loss of over $119 billion since 9/11 due to terrorism. He said the problem had been aggravated by the corresponding rise in illicit drug trade, which had largely remained unchecked and throbbed as the major source of terror financing. “Why has the global coalition against terrorism consistently failed to control and destroy the booming poppy cultivation? Increased production facilities and the expanding drug trade is a question that many fail to answer,” he said. Ayaz Sadiq termed the gathering of six countries speakers in Islamabad a historic occasion and noted that the parliamentary heads of these nations had arrived here for the first time to reaffirm their commitment to shared peace and prosperity and forge new grounds of mutual cooperation. The speaker said China and Pakistan alone provided half of the world’s cotton adding, “The untapped resources of Afghanistan could make it the richest mining region on earth while its mastery in infrastructural construction industry has brought Turkey to the top rankings in the world.” Ayaz Sadiq said the post-cold-war world had proved to be more dangerous and insecure than the bipolar era. “On the one side, the rise of unipolarism has given way to unilateralism and global hegemony, on the other, the ideals of respect for international borders and nations’ sovereignty are in danger with the introduction of the phenomenon of non-state actors,” he added. He said the seemingly unending spate of terrorist attacks during the last 10 years had rocked every corner of the world, claiming over two hundred thousand lives. “Almost half of these unfortunate victims were from our region,” he added. Ayaz said, “Most of our respective countries have faced the maximum brunt either through the al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the East Turkistan Islamic Movement and now the eminent threat of the Daesh.” He said innocent men, women and children across continents had been displaced and forced to leave their lands. “Of the five top countries in the world, hosting largest number of refugees, three are represented here; namely Turkey, Pakistan and Iran,” he said. Although, he said, religious fanaticism has been often cited as the main cause of global terrorism, let us not forget that that rise of populist right and the sanctioning of oppression have also added fuel to the mayhem. He said the recent controversy created around the status of the Holy city of Jerusalem was not only a move to violate the international law and the related UN resolutions, but also a deliberate attempt to undermine peace efforts. “It is a move to divide the people of the world further and fan religious animosity,” he said. He said the overall mutual trade volume of six countries gathered here was just 366 billion dollars for the year 2016, which was merely 2 percent of the entire global trade volume.

The Indian "spy", who was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court over espionage and sabotage charges, met his mother and wife at Foreign Office in Islamabad on Monday. "I requested a meeting with my wife and mother and I am thankful to the government of Pakistan for this grand gesture," Jadhav said in a video shot prior to the meeting. Jadhav's mother Avanti and wife Chetankul Jadhav was accompanied by the Deputy Indian High Commissioner JP Singh during the meeting, which lasted for 40 minutes. However, the Indian diplomat was not allowed to speak or listen to the conversation. The pictures, released by Pakistan's Foreign Office, showed Jadhav and his family members are separated by a glass screen as they talked to each other on phone. The 47-year-old Jadhav was arrested in March last year in Mashkel, a town a few kilometers (miles) from the Iranian border. According to Pakistani military, he was a serving Indian naval officer and using the Muslim name Hussein Mubarak Patel. However, New Delhi described him as a retired naval officer. After the meeting, Jadhav's mother and wife met the Foreign Office spokesman Mohammad Faisal and thanked the government of Pakistan and foreign office for arranging their meeting. "This is a very important day for Pakistan, being the birth anniversary of the Father of the nation, Quaid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. It was in this light that this day was chosen for the humanitarian meeting of Commander Jadhav with his wife and mother," Faisal told reporters shortly after the meeting. "Commander Jadhav -- an Indian spy, a terrorist and a saboteur -- is a serving Indian naval officer sentenced to death for his involvement in espionage, terrorism and subversive activities against Pakistan," Faisal recalled. "Let us be very clear that Commander Jadhav is the face of Indian terrorism, especially in Pakistan," the spokesman added. The military tribunal in Pakistan found him guilty of espionage and involved in terror acts, sentenced him to death in April this year. Later, Jadhav submitted a mercy petition to the Pakistan's army chief on compassionate grounds on June 2017, however, it is still pending and no decision has been taken so far.

It was in this light that this day was chosen for the humanitarian meeting of Commander Jadhav with his wife and mother," Faisal told reporters shortly after the meeting. "Commander Jadhav -- an Indian spy, a terrorist and a saboteur -- is a serving Indian naval officer sentenced to death for his involvement in espionage, terrorism and subversive activities against Pakistan," Faisal recalled. "Let us be very clear that Commander Jadhav is the face of Indian terrorism, especially in Pakistan," the spokesman added. The military tribunal in Pakistan found him guilty of espionage and involved in terror acts, sentenced him to death in April this year. Later, Jadhav submitted a mercy petition to the Pakistan's army chief on compassionate grounds on June 2017, however, it is still pending and no decision has been taken so far.

News article:
New Delhi accused Pakistani authorities of disrespecting the cultural and religious sensibilities of Jadhav's family India Tuesday accused Pakistan of harassing the family of an alleged Indian spy on death row, saying their meeting was held in an "atmosphere of coercion". Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav met his mother and wife in Islamabad on Monday, their first meeting since his arrest in Pakistan last year on charges of espionage and terrorism, allegations India has rejected. "It appears that Jadhav was under considerable stress and speaking in an atmosphere of coercion," the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement shortly after top Indian officials debriefed his family in New Delhi. The ministry alleged that Jadhav's conversation during the meeting was "tutored and designed to perpetuate the false narrative of his alleged activities in Pakistan." Pakistani officials say Jadhav, who was arrested in the restive southwestern province of Balochistan, confessed to spying for Indian intelligence, and describe him as "the face of Indian terrorism in Pakistan". Jadhav was found guilty in a closed trial by a military court and sentenced to death on charges of espionage and terrorism. India took the case to the International Court of Justice which suspended his execution until it passes final judgement in the case. Pictures released by the Pakistan government on Monday showed Jadhav and his family speaking through a glass barrier at the foreign ministry in Islamabad. An Indian diplomat was present during the meeting, which lasted 40 minutes, but was not allowed to talk to the prisoner or listen to the conversation with his family. New Delhi said Pakistan disrespected the cultural and religious sensibilities of Jadhav's family, alleging they were asked to change their clothes, and that his wife was ordered to remove her "mangal sutra" -- a necklace worn by married Hindu women. The Indian foreign ministry added that Pakistani authorities did not return the shoes Jadhav's wife was ordered to remove. It also accused Islamabad of allowing local journalists to "harass and hector" the Jadhav family, violating an understanding between Islamabad and New Delhi to not allow the media "close" access. India also raised concerns over Jadhav's health, although he was seen sitting up in the grainy pictures. Pakistani officials said he was in good health. New Delhi has maintained that Jadhav is innocent and that he was kidnapped by Pakistani authorities, also accusing Islamabad of violating the Vienna Convention by denying Jadhav consular access. The nuclear-armed neighbours routinely accuse one another of sending spies into their countries. Jadhav joined India's prestigious National Defence Academy in 1987 and was commissioned as an engineer in the Indian Navy in 1991 before reportedly starting a business in Iran.

News article:
NEW DELHI: India is debating the real intent behind Pakistan allowing Kulbhushan Jadhav, a convicted Indian spy facing the death sentence in a Pakistani jail, to meet his mother and wife. Jadhav’s mother Avanti Jadhav and wife Chetankul Jadhav, accompanied by the Indian Deputy High Commissioner J.P. Singh, met the former Indian navy officer in Islamabad on Monday afternoon. “It has happened due to international pressure,” said Suman Sharma, a New Delhi-based foreign affairs expert. “It is a tactical gesture by the Pakistan government before the next hearing at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which is hearing the case. Islamabad can argue in the ICJ that they are treating the case from the humanitarian points of view,” Sharma told Arab News. Dr. Zakir Husain of the Indian Council of World Affairs, a New Delhi based think-tank, said: “The larger point of this meeting is more than humanitarian. Pakistan is sending a signal that it is willing to break the ice with India and hold talks with its eastern neighbor.” Talking to Arab News, Husain underlined that “it’s now up to India how it responds to the Pakistani overtures. This comes just days after the Pakistani army chief’s announcement of his willingness to talk with India.” However, there was a lot of curiosity in Mumbai, the city where Jadhav’s family lives. “We are really excited about the meeting taking place in Islamabad,” said Subrato Mukherjee, an old friend of Jadhav in Mumbai. Talking to Arab News, Mukherjee said that “last week a bike rally and human chain were organized in the city to extend support to Jadhav’s family and express our solidarity with the family.” India does not accept the Pakistani version of the story that Jadav was arrested in Baluchistan province of Pakistan on March 3, 2016, and was acting as a spy to create disturbances in its territory. New Delhi, however, claims that Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran, where he went to do some business after his retirement from the Indian Navy. Jadhav’s case has created a frenzy in the Indian media with the majority calling Pakistan’s move “an optical illusion and choreographed exercise.” “On the question of Pakistan, Indian media loses its balance. We lose objectivity and sense of proportion,” said Sharma. “I feel the Jadhav case is a wonderful opportunity for both India and Pakistan to engage each other in dialogue. Had there been a regular mechanism of engagement between the two nations, we would not have had this kind of polarized debate and tension.”

News article:
Pakistan has warned the United States and President Donald Trump against taking unilateral military action in the country against extremist groups, after warnings from top officials in the president's administration and the American leader himself. Vice President Mike Pence said in a speech during a trip to Afghanistan earlier this month that Trump had issued a warning to Pakistan and cautioned that there was much for the country to lose if it aided extremist groups in any way. "As the president said, so I say now: Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with the U.S., and Pakistan has much to lose by continuing to harbor criminals and terrorists," Pence said. Relations between the U.S. and Pakistan have been fraught since it came to light that Osama bin Laden, the former Al-Qaeda leader and mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, was in hiding at a safe house in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad before the infamous U.S. Special Forces operation to kill him in 2011. Islamabad rejected the accusation that it could have been aiding extremist groups and was not doing enough to help Washington. "We have sacrificed a lot. We have paid a huge price both in blood and treasure. We have done enough, and we cannot do any more for anyone," Pakistani military spokesman Major-General Asif Ghafoor said Friday, according to Al-Jazeera. "Had we not supported [the U.S.], Al-Qaeda would not have been defeated," he continued. The country is battling an insurgency by the Pakistani Taliban, Al-Qaeda and a growing ISIS presence in the border regions with Afghanistan. The military has launched several major operations against these militant groups for several years. ISIS has continued to gain ground in Afghanistan, and Pakistan has made efforts to halt the militant group's spread to its territory. The jihadi group created an affiliate for the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region known as Khorasan Province, a historical name for the region. ISIS has conducted several attacks inside Pakistani territory, including suicide bombings against religious minorities the group considers to be heretical. The deadliest was the August 2016 suicide bombing that killed at least 70 people in the southwestern city of Quetta. While it has been conducting operations against militant groups, the Trump administration has been eager to press Pakistan to do more. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned Islamabad in an opinion piece in The New York Times published Wednesday. "We are prepared to partner with Pakistan to defeat terrorist organizations seeking safe havens, but Pakistan must demonstrate its desire to partner with us," he wrote. Despite the warnings, Trump praised Pakistan in October for working closely with U.S. authorities. "Starting to develop a much better relationship with Pakistan and its leaders. I want to thank them for their cooperation on many fronts," Trump wrote in a tweet. While the Pakistani government may want to work with the president, the Pakistani people are not so fond of the construction magnate. Thousands of Pakistani Islamists held rallies opposing Trump in two cities last week, condemning his declaration to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The December 6 announcement angered Muslims around the world. East Jerusalem hosts the third-holiest site in Islam, the Haram al-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary, which Jews also revere as the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism.

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 complementary.

The image shows a group of men in suits, some of whom are wearing turbans, sitting at a conference table and clapping. The men are likely to be government officials or other important figures. The image is taken from a high angle, which makes the men look small and insignificant. This may be a reflection of the fact that the men are not in control of the situation. The news events set is about the relationship between Pakistan and the United States. The two countries have been at odds with each other for many years, and the Trump administration has recently threatened to take military action against Pakistan. The image is complementary to the news events set because it shows the two countries' leaders meeting to discuss their differences. The image is not aligned with the news events set because it does not show any specific event that is mentioned in the news articles.

News article:
WASHINGTON/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The United States accused Pakistan on Tuesday of playing a “double game” on fighting terrorism and warned Islamabad it would have to do more if it wanted to maintain U.S. aid. “They can do more to stop terrorism and we want them to do that,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters. The White House said it would likely announce actions to pressure Pakistan within days, shortly after U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said at the United Nations that Washington would withhold $255 million in assistance to Pakistan. “There are clear reasons for this. Pakistan has played a double game for years,” Haley told reporters. “They work with us at times, and they also harbor the terrorists that attack our troops in Afghanistan. “That game is not acceptable to this administration. We expect far more cooperation from Pakistan in the fight against terrorism.” The comments followed an angry tweet from President Donald Trump on Monday that the United States had been rewarded with “nothing but lies and deceit” for “foolishly” giving Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid in the past 15 years. “They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!” he tweeted. Pakistan civilian and military chiefs on Tuesday rejected “incomprehensible” U.S. comments and summoned American Ambassador David Hale to explain Trump’s tweet. Pakistani U.N. Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi said in a statement that her country’s fight against terrorism was not based on any consideration of aid but on national interests and principles. “We have contributed and sacrificed the most in fighting international terrorism and carried out the largest counter terrorism operation anywhere in the world,” Lodhi said. “We can review our cooperation if it is not appreciated.” Relations with Washington have been strained for years over Islamabad’s alleged support for Haqqani network militants, who are allied with the Afghan Taliban. The United States also alleges that senior Afghan Taliban commanders live on Pakistani soil, and has signaled it will cut aid and take other steps if Islamabad does not stop helping or turning a blind eye to Haqqani militants crossing the border to carry out attacks in Afghanistan. In 2016, Taliban leader Mullah Mansour was killed by a U.S. drone strike inside Pakistan and in 2011, al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed by U.S. troops in the garrison town of Abbottabad.

REUTERS/Jim Bourg/File Photo STATE DEPT: PAKISTAN NEEDS TO EARN AID At the State Department on Tuesday, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Pakistan knew what it needed to do, including taking action against the Haqqani network and other militants. Pakistan needs to “earn, essentially, the money that we have provided in the past in foreign military assistance,” she said. Islamabad bristles at the suggestion it is not doing enough to fight militants, noting that its casualties at the hands of Islamists since 2001 number in the tens of thousands. Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Tuesday chaired a National Security Committee meeting of civilian and military chiefs, focusing on Trump’s tweet. The meeting, which lasted nearly three hours, was brought forward by a day and followed an earlier meeting of army generals. The committee, in a statement issued by the prime minister’s office, did not name Trump but spoke of “deep disappointment” at a slew of critical comments from U.S. officials over the past few months. “Recent statements and articulation by the American leadership were completely incomprehensible as they contradicted facts manifestly, struck with great insensitivity at the trust between two nations built over generations, and negated the decades of sacrifices made by the Pakistani nation,” it said.

The rocky Pakistan-US relations sank to a new low with the advent of New Year with President Donald Trump accusing Islamabad of ‘lies and deceit’, drawing a strong protest from the government.In his first tweets of 2018, Trump said Pakistan gave the US nothing but 'lies and deceit' and that the country provided safe havens to Afghan 'terrorists'.Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif hit back to the outright accusation, saying: "the United States should hold its own people accountable for its failures in Afghanistan."He also spoke to a private TV channel and shared his views on the on-going war against terrorism. "We have already said 'no more' to America, so Trump's 'no more' has no importance.”Referring to Trump’s claim that US gave Pakistan $33 billion in aid, Asif said: “We are ready to give all account for every single penny to America in public."Separately, Defence Minister Khurram Dastagir said that Pakistan had cooperated enough with the US in the war against terrorism.However, he made abundantly clear that the Afghanistan war would not be fought from Pakistan.Hours later, US Ambassador David Hale was summoned to the Foreign Ministry. Sources said Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua lodged strong protest over Trump’s tweet and sought an explanation from the ambassador.Opposition politicians have also noted with concern further deterioration of the Pakistan-US relations, which have already been strained since Trump took over the office a year ago.Senior Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader Senator Sherry Rehman stressed the need for Pakistan to have a balanced stance and not be too aggressive in replying to the US.She said the reason why Washington is being reactive is due to gaps in Pakistan's foreign policy. "The gaps should be filled. The world can see the lack of governance and is taking advantage of how Pakistan has not responded."Rehman, also a former Pakistani ambassador to the US, said the Coalition Support Fund (CSF) has never been counted as aid in any accounting in Pakistan, nor will it be seen as part of assistance.Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader and former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that matters of foreign policy must not be delivered through social media but should be debated in a proper setting.Qureshi said challenges facing Pakistan are not being addressed adequately. "Pakistan has to move forward taking into account its own interests, irrespective of whether it gets US aid or not," he said.Omar Waraich, the Amnesty International Deputy Director for South Asia, cautioned the US that there were only two supply routes into Afghanistan, which go through Pakistan and Iran.However, he questioned how Saudi Arabia, a traditional ally of Pakistan, could see the US pushing Pakistan into the sphere of influence of Iran, Russia and China.

News article:
Pakistan has decided to review its relations with the United States and adopt a tough stance, in the wake of President Donald Trump’s recent statement, it is learnt.Pakistan will highlight its sacrifices in the war against terrorism at the diplomatic front; and if the US reduces or suspends aid to Pakistan or places any sanctions, the country will completely revise its relations policy with the superpower, according to sources.Pakistan, said the sources, would not accept any demands to do more, and could stop all kinds of cooperation with the US.

Not a single important country is supporting the US stance. The US fears that if it moves any resolution against Pakistan in the UNGA, China or Russia may veto it.According to the sources, since the US understands the importance of Pakistan; the Trump administration will think several times before taking any action against Pakistan. “Any anti-Pakistan step may deprive the superpower of valuable cooperation.”They said that the federal government had also decided to take parliament into confidence on the current situation of the Pak-US relations, and the federal government would devise its future strategy on relations with the US in consultation with the military leadership.

News article:
The Pakistani government has summoned US ambassador David Hale to the nation's foreign office after US President Trump said the state was protecting terrorists. In a tweet, Trump accused Islamabad of "lies & deceit." Islamabad called on the US envoy to Pakistan David Hale to explain US President Donald Trump's claims that Pakistan was harboring and aiding jihadists from neighboring Afghanistan. Hale was summoned to Pakistan's foreign office on Monday, hours after the US president used his first tweet in 2018 to slam Pakistan for "lies & deceit." Trump also hinted at cutting or limiting US aid to Pakistan. "The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars (€29 billion) in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools," Trump wrote on Twitter. "They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!" The US embassy to Pakistan confirmed that the meet took place but refused to provide details on the conversation. "We don't have any comment on the substance of the meeting," a spokesman said. Pakistan Prime Minister Shahif Khaqan Abbasi is due to host a cabinet meeting that would focus on Trump's accusations on Tuesday, while country's top security officials would consider US ties on the next day. US trapped in a 'dead-end street' Following the tweet, Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said Trump's comments were motivated by US failures in Afghanistan. Asif also said Pakistan did not need US aid. "He has tweeted against us and Iran for his domestic consumption," Asif told Geo TV on Monday. "He is, again and again, displacing his frustrations on Pakistan over failures in Afghanistan as they are trapped in dead-end street in Afghanistan."

News article:
New Delhi has sought three-month time to file an additional memorial at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) which is hearing case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, a convicted Indian spy, sources have revealed to The Express TribuneLegal experts are, however, wondering why India is trying to drag the matter unnecessarily. A senior lawyer, who has expertise in international law, believes that under the ICJ rules, another round of submitting additional memorial can be started by both the parties.“If the ICJ gives three-month time to India then Pakistan may also avail similar period to file a counter memorial in the case. Generally, there are two rounds of filing memorial. After submission of memorial, the ICJ will give schedule of hearing,” he added.While submitting 1,700 pages counter memorial in the ICJ on December 13, Pakistan rejected Indian objection to not giving consular access to Jadhav, saying the provision of such an access under the Vienna Convention is only for legitimate visitors and not spies.Pakistan said since India did not deny Jadhav was travelling with an assumed Muslim name, they have no case to plead. India has sought consular access to Jadhav repeatedly but Pakistan has turned down its requests, citing bilateral accord that does not permit such an access to spies. However, on December 25 Islamabad allowed Jadhav’s mother and wife to meet with him on purely humanitarian grounds.It is learnt that the Foreign Office, attorney general for Pakistan (AGP), and military establishment gave their input to finalise the counter memorial. The government also sought assistance from two top lawyers of the country. However, the memorial was drafted by Pakistan’s top attorney Khawar Quraishi.According to sources, Pakistan stated in the memorial that the Indians have not denied that Jadhav was travelling on a passport with an assumed Muslim name.It said India did not explain how a serving naval commander, operating under Indian spy agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), was travelling under an assumed name. This leads to only one conclusion that India seeks consular access to the information he [Jadhav] had gathered, it added.It said since Jadhav was on active duty, it is obvious that he was a spy sent on a special mission. “Only a state which adheres to legitimate actions can request the court to intervene in a matter between two states. A state which does not come with clean hands cannot get any relief,” Pakistan contended.Pakistan further said sending Jadhav for espionage and funding terrorist activities were some of the reasons that disentitle India from invoking jurisdiction of the ICJ.Sources said Pakistan also highlighted constant violations of human rights by India in occupied-Kashmir. It said India is a habitual violator of human rights and has not honoured the UN resolutions on Kashmir.“Giving of false identity to Kulbhushan, sending him for espionage and funding of terrorists activities are all some of the reasons which disentitle India from invoking jurisdiction of the ICJ,” said counter memorial according to a source. The ICJ will decide the schedule of hearing within 15 days.India on September 13 submitted a 22-page memorandum wherein it objected to Jadhav being tried by a military court in Pakistan. The sources said India contended that Jadhav’s trial should have been conducted by a civilian court and that Pakistan was bound to give him consular access.The federal government has already appointed former chief justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani as an ad-hoc judge for the case at The Hague. Legal experts are urging all the stakeholders to increase coordination in devising the final draft of the memorandum.The ICJ on May 18 halted the execution of Jadhav, who was sentenced to death by a military court on April 10 after being convicted on charges of terrorism and espionage.Jadhav alias Hussain Mubarak Patel, a serving Indian Navy officer working for the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) was apprehended on March 3, 2016, after he illegally crossed into Pakistan via Iran border.

However, the memorial was drafted by Pakistan’s top attorney Khawar Quraishi.According to sources, Pakistan stated in the memorial that the Indians have not denied that Jadhav was travelling on a passport with an assumed Muslim name.It said India did not explain how a serving naval commander, operating under Indian spy agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), was travelling under an assumed name. This leads to only one conclusion that India seeks consular access to the information he [Jadhav] had gathered, it added.It said since Jadhav was on active duty, it is obvious that he was a spy sent on a special mission. “Only a state which adheres to legitimate actions can request the court to intervene in a matter between two states. A state which does not come with clean hands cannot get any relief,” Pakistan contended.Pakistan further said sending Jadhav for espionage and funding terrorist activities were some of the reasons that disentitle India from invoking jurisdiction of the ICJ.Sources said Pakistan also highlighted constant violations of human rights by India in occupied-Kashmir. It said India is a habitual violator of human rights and has not honoured the UN resolutions on Kashmir.“Giving of false identity to Kulbhushan, sending him for espionage and funding of terrorists activities are all some of the reasons which disentitle India from invoking jurisdiction of the ICJ,” said counter memorial according to a source. The ICJ will decide the schedule of hearing within 15 days.India on September 13 submitted a 22-page memorandum wherein it objected to Jadhav being tried by a military court in Pakistan. The sources said India contended that Jadhav’s trial should have been conducted by a civilian court and that Pakistan was bound to give him consular access.The federal government has already appointed former chief justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani as an ad-hoc judge for the case at The Hague. Legal experts are urging all the stakeholders to increase coordination in devising the final draft of the memorandum.The ICJ on May 18 halted the execution of Jadhav, who was sentenced to death by a military court on April 10 after being convicted on charges of terrorism and espionage.Jadhav alias Hussain Mubarak Patel, a serving Indian Navy officer working for the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) was apprehended on March 3, 2016, after he illegally crossed into Pakistan via Iran border.

News article:
On Thursday, the U.S. State Department added Pakistan to a watch list for religious freedom violations. This follows an angry tweet from Donald Trump about Pakistan, and a more substantive cut-off of U.S. security assistance. Pakistan has faced years of criticism for its failure to disrupt terrorist activity within its borders and its persistent violations of religious freedom. Should those of us worried about the status of religious freedom be heartened by this move? Unfortunately, the answer is no. There is no indication the Trump Administration will actually follow through with these actions to call for reforms in Pakistan. Tensions between Trump and Pakistan have been growing for months. In an August 2016 speech on his Afghanistan strategy, Trump criticized Pakistan, accusing it of “housing the very terrorists we fight.” And then on New Year’s Day, Trump sent an angry tweet about Pakistan, threatening to cut off U.S. aid. This week, he followed through, suspending U.S. aid. To the surprise of some, the Administration also called out Pakistan for human rights abuses, placing it on a watch list for religious freedom violations. The Trump administration’s actions may appear abrupt, but they reflect long-standing concerns. Pakistan and the United States have had a tense relationship on counterterrorism since the 1990s. The United States was initially critical of Pakistan’s support for Kashmiri militant groups. This expanded to concerns about al-Qaeda due to Pakistan’s ties to the Taliban — which hosted Osama bin Ladin — and blind eye towards al-Qaeda operatives. As I discussed in my book, while Pakistan did cooperate with America in some very important ways after 9/11, it continued to allow terrorists to operate in its territory. Advertisement Pakistan’s religious freedom record is also a problem. The country’s blasphemy laws have enabled vigilante violence against religious minorities — particularly Christians — and the authorities have done little to stop this violence. Additionally, Ahmadi Muslims face both social and governmental discrimination and harassment. The government also has favored hard-line Islamist groups for decades, giving these groups significant sway over the society to the detriment of Muslims and non-Muslims. When I ran the Pew Research Center’s work on religious freedom, Pakistan was consistently among the most repressive countries in the world. So I should be happy with the Trump administration’s actions. It is taking steps to pressure Pakistan on counterterrorism while also clearly condemning its religious freedom violations. But as with other aspects of its foreign policy, this administration is doing the right thing for the wrong reason. It is also unlikely to follow through. First, there is no indication this administration is committed to religious freedom. While Trump has made a big show of domestic religious freedom debates, international human rights promotion is not a priority. Secretary of State Tillerson announced that advancing U.S. values can be “an obstacle” for U.S. interests. In this case, condemning Pakistan is in line with Trump’s security priorities, but religious freedom is clearly the secondary issue here. Advancing religious freedom requires not just cutting off aid, but working with states to reform their policies. I don’t see that happening under Trump. Second, even if Trump was serious on increasing religious freedom in Pakistan, how would he do it? Under Tillerson, the State Department has been gutted. State Department employees — including its religious freedom office — appear to be valiantly attempting to continue their mission despite Tillerson’s cuts. But actually advancing religious freedom will require engagement on religious issues and close monitoring to ensure compliance. As with Trump’s declaration on ISIL’s genocide, rhetoric will not translate into actions without a fully-staffed, well-supported State Department. Moreover, Trump’s belligerent, confrontational style will undermine existing initiatives; Pakistani political figures are calling on their government to “remove” U.S. diplomatic personnel in response to Trump’s actions. Advertisement Some may accuse me of being cranky, or biased against Trump. But religious freedom advocates need to be very careful. Trump is saying the right things, but there is little indication he will actually act on international religious freedom. We have seen this repeatedly over the past year. Besides Tillerson’s dismissal of “values,” there is also Vice President Pence’s trip to the Middle East, meant to show solidarity with Middle East Christians; it was postponed after the furor over Trump’s statements on Jerusalem, and there is no indication it will be rescheduled.

 complementary.

The image shows Donald Trump and Imran Khan, the leaders of the United States and Pakistan, respectively. The two leaders are shown shaking hands in the Oval Office. This image is highly related to the news article, which discusses the relationship between the United States and Pakistan. The article discusses how the two countries have had a tense relationship for many years, and how Trump has recently criticized Pakistan for its human rights abuses and support for terrorism. The image of Trump and Khan shaking hands suggests that the two leaders are trying to improve relations between their two countries. However, the article also discusses how Trump is unlikely to follow through on his threats to cut off aid to Pakistan. This suggests that the image may be more symbolic than substantive. Overall, the relationship between the image and the news events set is complementary. The image provides a visual representation of the news article, and the article provides additional information about the context of the image.

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 complementary.

The image shows Donald Trump and the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, meeting in the Oval Office. This is a significant event, as it is the first time that the two leaders have met since Trump took office. The meeting comes at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and Pakistan. Trump has repeatedly criticized Pakistan for its support of terrorism, and he has threatened to cut off aid to the country. Pakistan, for its part, has denied the allegations of supporting terrorism, and it has accused the United States of interfering in its internal affairs.

The image is complementary to the news events set because it provides a visual representation of the relationship between Trump and Khan. The image shows the two leaders smiling and shaking hands, which suggests that they are on good terms. However, the image also shows that the two leaders are standing at a distance from each other, which suggests that there is still some tension between them. The image is a reminder that the relationship between the United States and Pakistan is complex and that there is still work to be done to improve it.

News article:
By IPCS By Abhijit Iyer Mitra* On Friday, 29 December 2017, the Government of India faced a major public embarrassment, one that provides some insights into the failure of intelligence. What it shows is one of three things: a failure of gathering, collation and transmission of intelligence; a failure to archive, collate and assess foreign policy; or, possibly, a serial failure of both intelligence and foreign policy fronts and a diagnostics problem within the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). Background On 21 December, India voted for a resolution at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), condemning the US’ decision to shift its embassy to Jerusalem (a move thus supportive of the Palestinian position and condemnatory of the Israeli and US position). On 29 December, pictures started circulating on the Internet of a meeting between the Palestinian ambassador to Pakistan, Walid Abu Ali, and wanted terrorist, head of the Jamaat ud-Dawa (JuD), and founder of the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT), Hafiz Saeed. By the time India lodged a diplomatic protest and Palestine formally recalled Abu Ali, documentary and photographic evidence emerged of at least two previous meetings (August 2014 and December 2014). While knowledge of these meetings may not have changed India’s vote, the Ministry of External Affairs’ (MEA) actions in dealing with the snafu seems to indicate no prior knowledge of the meetings, which was particularly galling in the backdrop of the 21 December vote. Implications Hafiz Saeed is one of India’s most wanted men, responsible for masterminding the 26/11 Mumbai attacks and the 2006 Mumbai train bombings, and as such a prime target for 24/7 surveillance by India. Given his accessibility to the public, keeping tabs on him is not particularly challenging, complemented by the Difa-e-Pakistan Twitter handle and coverage by Pakistani newspapers. This points to one of two possibilities. Either Indian intelligence is not equipped to perform such basic OSINT activities as what Indian Twitter users can. Or, such intelligence existed but was buried deep in the system and could not be archived for efficient extraction when required to make policy decisions, either on 21 December when the UN vote happened, or indeed on 29 December when pictures of the December 2017 meeting surfaced. What is however known for a fact is that even after the situation blew up publicly, the diplomatic protest note sent to the Palestinians referred only to the December 2017 meeting, which indicates that the MEA had no knowledge of the previous meetings (by this time, the open source verification of previous meetings had not emerged). This is particularly worrying as it implies that either the MEA did not seek intelligence inputs on previous meetings, or that despite requests such inputs were not provided, that there was no intelligence on the subject to provide, or that the MEA decision was taken despite knowing the scale and extent of links between the Palestinian Authority and Hafiz Saeed. While the last option points to questionable policymaking, the previous three possibilities beg the question, why has the MEA not invested in public source intelligence gathering or outsourcing the work to a think-tank? This is all the more jarring given the minister-in-charge’s penchant for playing twitter agony-aunt. If it is assumed that the MEA has in fact invested in such open source intelligence gathering, then clearly the archiving and retrieval systems were not in place for such intelligence to be used rapidly and in a policy-relevant manner. What is most indicative of systemic failure on the MEA’s part is the Palestinian explanation, which was accepted without demur by South Block. First, it made the Palestinian state’s regret over its ambassador’s actions conditional, dependent on India’s continuing support to the Palestinian position. Second, it claimed the meeting was a mistake, ignoring the fact that there were several meetings. Incredulously this would also lead on to accept that Walid Abu Ali, a former Palestinian Intelligence official, did not know who he was deep in conversation with, given the fact that the LeT was co-founded by a Palestinian, Abdullah Azzam, who for a while had cooperated with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) against Israel. Finally, the PMO’s functioning must be examined. By all accounts this is a prime minister who takes a great deal of interest in foreign policy. That the PM has not been able to diagnose and institute rectifying measures since the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) debacle (where official statements emanating from Delhi were in significant variance from ground reports from Vienna and Seoul) does not instil confidence in his stewardship of intelligence matters. Depending on preferences and biases, it can be concluded that either intelligence or the MEA have been tried and found wanting, or that all have failed in equal measure, as there were no redundancies in place to damage control the situation. What is however undeniable is the PMO has neither diagnosed the problem over the last three years, or taken corrective action. * Abhijit Iyer Mitra Senior Research Fellow, IPCS

The specific event depicted in the image can reflect the events in the news events set because it shows Hafiz Saeed, who is wanted by India for his role in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, meeting with the Palestinian ambassador to Pakistan. This meeting is significant because it suggests that Palestine is supporting Hafiz Saeed and his terrorist organization.

This is particularly worrying as it implies that either the MEA did not seek intelligence inputs on previous meetings, or that despite requests such inputs were not provided, that there was no intelligence on the subject to provide, or that the MEA decision was taken despite knowing the scale and extent of links between the Palestinian Authority and Hafiz Saeed. While the last option points to questionable policymaking, the previous three possibilities beg the question, why has the MEA not invested in public source intelligence gathering or outsourcing the work to a think-tank? This is all the more jarring given the minister-in-charge’s penchant for playing twitter agony-aunt. If it is assumed that the MEA has in fact invested in such open source intelligence gathering, then clearly the archiving and retrieval systems were not in place for such intelligence to be used rapidly and in a policy-relevant manner. What is most indicative of systemic failure on the MEA’s part is the Palestinian explanation, which was accepted without demur by South Block. First, it made the Palestinian state’s regret over its ambassador’s actions conditional, dependent on India’s continuing support to the Palestinian position. Second, it claimed the meeting was a mistake, ignoring the fact that there were several meetings. Incredulously this would also lead on to accept that Walid Abu Ali, a former Palestinian Intelligence official, did not know who he was deep in conversation with, given the fact that the LeT was co-founded by a Palestinian, Abdullah Azzam, who for a while had cooperated with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) against Israel. Finally, the PMO’s functioning must be examined. By all accounts this is a prime minister who takes a great deal of interest in foreign policy. That the PM has not been able to diagnose and institute rectifying measures since the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) debacle (where official statements emanating from Delhi were in significant variance from ground reports from Vienna and Seoul) does not instil confidence in his stewardship of intelligence matters. Depending on preferences and biases, it can be concluded that either intelligence or the MEA have been tried and found wanting, or that all have failed in equal measure, as there were no redundancies in place to damage control the situation. What is however undeniable is the PMO has neither diagnosed the problem over the last three years, or taken corrective action. * Abhijit Iyer Mitra Senior Research Fellow, IPCS

The ties between the US and Pakistan further deteriorated after the US president had tweeted that his country made an unwise decision to provide over $33 billion aid to Pakistan in the last 15 years.In his tweet, Trump had accused Pakistan of giving nothing in return except lies and deceit by taking the US for a fool, saying, “They give safe havens to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!”Meanwhile in a related development reflecting on worsening ties, the US ambassador to Pakistan was summoned to the Foreign Office and a strong protest over Trump’s remarks was lodged with him.On the other hand, ties between Iran and Pakistan are improving especially a new turn in the bilateral ties came after the historic visit of Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajawa to Tehran in November last year.Iran and Pakistan have been enjoying strong brotherly relations since the creation of Pakistan way back in 1947.

Iran on Sunday urged Muslim nations to forge closer cooperation to counter the US policy of seeking to create division among them."The US' dishonest, duplicitous and divisive policy towards Muslim countries, including Iran and Pakistan, requires that they bolster cooperation against the US in addition to maintaining vigilance and taking preventive measures," Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, was quoted as saying by Iran’s state-owned Press TV.Shamkhani made the remarks during a meeting with National Security Adviser Nasser Khan Janjua, whose country has recently come under criticism by US President Donald Trump."We will not allow some countries to affect relations between the two countries through sending weapons and hiring terrorists to create insecurity on their borders," Shamkhani said.Recalling the historical and civilisation relations as well as the many cultural and religious ties between the two countries, Shamkhani highlighted the importance of the expansion of relations and cooperation for mutually reinforcing in various fields, especially against common threats.“Activating mechanisms for bilateral cooperation and designing joint procedures, in accordance with the changing components of threats, is one of the immediate measures that should be taken seriously by the relevant agencies in the two countries,” highlighted the Iranian official.For his part, Janjua said that Pakistan will expand cooperation with Iran in security and economic areas.Janjua also said Islamic countries should raise awareness to counter foreign plots which are being hatched to spread division among the Muslims.“Pakistan will strengthen its security and economic cooperation with the Islamic Republic of Iran,” he reiterated.“Islamabad welcomes new areas created for developing joint economic, commercial and trade cooperation,” he added.Shamkhani also criticised the US new national security strategy (NSS), saying it will spread insecurity and instability in the world.The remarks by the Iranian security chief came two days after Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said that he sees his country’s alliance with Washington as over after the US suspended security-related aid to Pakistan and levelled charges against Islamabad.“We do not have any alliance,” with the US, Khawaja Muhammad Asif said in an interview. “This is not how allies behave.”In announcing the strategy, Trump also targeted China and Russia.Referring to China, together with Russia, as rival and revisionist powers, Trump sharply criticised China for challenging American power.The United States’ severe allegations immediately sparked a backlash from China. The Chinese Foreign Ministry reprimanded the United States for “malicious slander.”The NSS laid forward the Trump administration’s harshest stance toward China since Trump took office in January last year.Singling China out for 33 mentions, the report bluntly criticized China for seeking to “challenge American influence, values, and wealth,” “attempting to erode American security and prosperity,” and using “technology, propaganda, and coercion to shape a world antithetical to” U.S. interests and values.Specifically, the NSS claimed that “China seeks to displace the United States in the Indo-Pacific region, expand the reaches of its state-driven economic model, and reorder the region in its favour.”

News article:
Islamabad: The Pakistan Interfaith League (PIL) said that the latest decision by the US to put Pakistan on its ‘Watch List’ aimed at monitoring the religious intolerance in the country is nothing short of stabbing a friend in the back. The PIL Chairman, Sajid Ishaq, said that history is witness to the fact that Pakistan has always extended support to the US and the two wars in the region which involved the US, one in Afghanistan against the then USSR and the on-going war on terror, also in Afghanistan, Pakistan remained the main ally of the US. “Unfortunately in both the adventures the US ditched Pakistan at the end and instead of appreciating the sacrifices offered by the Pakistan government as well as the Pakistani people, it turned hostile towards Pakistan,” Sajid Ishaq said. “But, first suspending the military assistance to Pakistan despite the sacrifices the country and its people have extended in war on terror and now putting Pakistan on a watch list to monitor religious intolerance in the country is nothing but a cruel joke,” Sajid Ishaq said. He said that the situation of religious tolerance amongst the followers of different faiths is far better than in many other countries. He pointed out that in India, the most populous country on earth there not a single day passes when a horrific incident of religious intolerance has not happened. “In Kashmir, Indian Army has let loose worst form of state sponsored terrorism against helpless Kashmiri Muslims who are only demanding their promised right to self determination. In Myanmar the Buddhists are mercilessly slaughtering helpless Rohingya Muslims. And in Israel, the Jewish forces are indiscriminately killing Palestinian Muslims, young and old, men and women. And these are a few facts to quote in response to the latest decision by the Trump-led US government to put Pakistan on this ‘watch list’,” Sajid Ishaq pointed out. He also said that even inside the US there have been violent incidents of religious and racial intolerance. “On the contrary,” Sajid Ishaq stressed, “in Pakistan the situation of religion-based tolerance and acceptance in society is far better. Be those Christians, the Sikhs or the Hindus, they are free to go to their respective religious places without any fear,” the PIL Chairman said. “So much so, the followers of different religions are participating and celebrating each other’s religious events and functions. The Prime Minister of Pakistan has attended the Hindu celebrations and the Pakistan Army Chief has attended the Christmas celebrations. The Bahai community has celebrated 200th birth anniversary of their spiritual leader all over the country and those functions were participated by the followers of different faiths in Pakistan, including Muslims,” Sajid Ishaq said. He said that this is the time for reckoning for Pakistan as well as for America. “America should realize and acknowledge the support and sacrifices Pakistan has extended to the US and Pakistan should take a pragmatic view of its relations with the US and instead of giving kneejerk reaction, should put its case based on facts and figures to wipe away the misunderstandings created between the two countries by those who are opposed to restoring lasting peace in this region,” Sajid Ishaq said.

Islamabad: The Pakistan Interfaith League (PIL) said that the latest decision by the US to put Pakistan on its ‘Watch List’ aimed at monitoring the religious intolerance in the country is nothing short of stabbing a friend in the back. The PIL Chairman, Sajid Ishaq, said that history is witness to the fact that Pakistan has always extended support to the US and the two wars in the region which involved the US, one in Afghanistan against the then USSR and the on-going war on terror, also in Afghanistan, Pakistan remained the main ally of the US. “Unfortunately in both the adventures the US ditched Pakistan at the end and instead of appreciating the sacrifices offered by the Pakistan government as well as the Pakistani people, it turned hostile towards Pakistan,” Sajid Ishaq said. “But, first suspending the military assistance to Pakistan despite the sacrifices the country and its people have extended in war on terror and now putting Pakistan on a watch list to monitor religious intolerance in the country is nothing but a cruel joke,” Sajid Ishaq said. He said that the situation of religious tolerance amongst the followers of different faiths is far better than in many other countries. He pointed out that in India, the most populous country on earth there not a single day passes when a horrific incident of religious intolerance has not happened. “In Kashmir, Indian Army has let loose worst form of state sponsored terrorism against helpless Kashmiri Muslims who are only demanding their promised right to self determination. In Myanmar the Buddhists are mercilessly slaughtering helpless Rohingya Muslims. And in Israel, the Jewish forces are indiscriminately killing Palestinian Muslims, young and old, men and women. And these are a few facts to quote in response to the latest decision by the Trump-led US government to put Pakistan on this ‘watch list’,” Sajid Ishaq pointed out.

Trump anti-Pakistan tirade to bring Iran, Pakistan closer IRNA – U.S. President Donald Trump’s harsh strategy towards Pakistan has created a space for closer Iran, Pakistan ties as the two countries have vowed to expand cooperation against common US-posed threats. The ties between the US and Pakistan further deteriorated after the US president had tweeted that his country made an unwise decision to provide over $33 billion aid to Pakistan in the last 15 years. In his tweet, Trump had accused Pakistan of giving nothing in return except lies and deceit by taking the US for a fool, saying, “They give safe havens to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!” Meanwhile in a related development reflecting on worsening ties, the US ambassador to Pakistan was summoned to the Foreign Office and a strong protest over Trump’s remarks was lodged with him. On the other hand, ties between Iran and Pakistan are improving especially a new turn in the bilateral ties came after the historic visit of Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajawa to Tehran in November last year. Iran and Pakistan have been enjoying strong brotherly relations since the creation of Pakistan way back in 1947. Since then the two countries have always been supporting each other on world issues. The last year has seen major developments in Iran-Pakistan ties and it is expected that the year proved to be fruitful for relations between the two neighboring states in the coming year as well. In a recent development, Pakistan Prime Minister’s National Security Adviser (NSA) Lt Gen (retd) Nasser Janjua has gone to Iran to discuss regional developments and bilateral ties. During his meeting with secretary of Iran’s National Security Council Ali Shamkhani, Janjua said that Pakistan will improve its security and economic relations with its neighboring country, Iran. On the other hand, Shamkhani slammed the US statements against Pakistan and Iran. He said that US policy is hypocritical. “We have to continue to work on cooperating against the US.” Criticizing the US new national security strategy that will increase insecurity and instability in the world, Shamkhani said that the double-standard and rift-widening policies of the US against Muslim countries, including Iran and Pakistan, necessitate alertness and deterring measures and expansion of ties among Muslim countries. Meanwhile Iranian Minister of Defense Brigadier General Amir Hatami in a telephone conversation with his Pakistani counterpart Khurram Dastagir Khan said that the US has always blamed others for its defeats in various parts of the world and pursued the Zionists approach to destabilize the region. Pakistani defense minister, for his part, welcomed expansion of defense cooperation between the two sides, and said rapid developments require closer cooperation between Iran and Pakistan. Both the ministers also agreed that recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Zionist regime by the United States had violated international understanding and destabilized the Middle East. Iran and Pakistan are also trying to enhance bilateral trade ties and leaders of the two countries have agreed to enhance the bilateral trade volume up to $5 billion by 2021.

News article:
Topic: Security Region: Asia Tags: AfghanistanWarTerrorismTalibanDonald Trump Afghanistan’s old wounds—no longer bandaged by U.S. dollar bills—are opening once again. President Donald Trump rang in the new year with a Twitter salvo directed at Pakistan, claiming that Washington has given Islamabad more than $33 billion in aid after 9/11, but has only received “lies and deceit” in return. The administration has since announced the suspension of military assistance to Pakistan. An unnamed State Department official has described the suspension as reversible should the Pakistani military take desired action against the Haqqani Network. The Trump administration appears to be moving toward a strategy of compellence toward Pakistan. It may be nonviolent right now, but could include lethal covert action, both visible (e.g. drone attacks) and less visible, and yield a series of unintended consequences that push the bilateral relationship beyond the point of no return. The asymmetries of the U.S.-Pakistan relationship may drive some in Washington to believe in the promise of compellence. But these asymmetries are counterveiled by mutual dependencies and other factors, including geography and salience. The United States does the cause of stabilizing Afghanistan no good by externalizing blame for the failing war or attributing it to a single insurgent network. The future of Afghanistan is bleak. Regardless of what American officials say, the United States can easily walk away from Afghanistan without injuring itself. But it is regional states that will bear the fallout from the disaster unfolding in Afghanistan—a disaster that has American and Afghan fingerprints all over it. The cycle of violence in Afghanistan is moving in an untenable direction. The Taliban now control or contest over 43 percent of Afghanistan’s districts, encompassing most of the outer perimeter of the country. Civilian deaths due to coalition bombing rise. Afghan security forces are dying in record-breaking numbers. Washington is arming more unwieldy militias with weapons. The documented Afghan economy has come to a standstill. Economic growth is surpassed by population growth. But drug production soars. Worst of all, Afghanistan’s leaders are heading toward confrontation with one another as the Trump administration looks on vainglorious and indolent. The bitter truth about Afghanistan is this: the relative stability Afghanistan experienced in the initial years post–9/11 will likely prove to be an exception, not the rule, in the country’s post–1973 history. Afghanistan’s old wounds—no longer bandaged by U.S. dollar bills—are opening once again. They, along with a resilient insurgency, will consume the country. American introspection combined with cooperation with regional states may stave off an ugly civil war in Afghanistan. The Region Speaks Recent actions by regional states amount to a vote of no confidence in the U.S.-led strategy for Afghanistan. Virtually all of Afghanistan’s neighbors are taking active measures to prevent instability and violence from the country spilling into their own. Last month, Tajikistan closed its border with northern Afghanistan after two of its border police officers were killed by Afghan drug traffickers. During this period, Russia delivered military hardware to the Tajik border with Afghanistan, to help Dushanbe control the border region. In December, China—Afghanistan’s neighbor to the northeast—said that it would provide $85 million to support a mountainous Afghan army brigade to secure the border province of Badakhshan, the former anti-Taliban bastion where the militant group has made significant inroads since 2013. Chinese security forces have reportedly been conducting patrols inside Badakhshan since at least 2016. There is also trouble in western Afghanistan. In late December, a commander with Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps claimed that Tehran conducted a unilateral operation in Afghan territory to free an Iranian captive. The Taliban have a strong presence along Afghanistan’s western frontier with Iran—due in part to support from Iranian intelligence. And then there is Pakistan—the locus of Trump’s ire—which will spend over $100 million to fence its border with Afghanistan and line it with additional security posts. Pakistan presently has roughly one thousand posts along its border with Afghanistan and will add hundreds more. It will sustain a troop presence of around two hundred thousand along the Afghan border, complemented by the paramilitary Frontier Corps. Afghanistan, in comparison, has around two hundred posts along the border with Pakistan. There is a four hundred mile stretch in southern Afghanistan where the Afghan government has no border posts—astonishing for a country that complains of cross-border insurgent inflows and has received $70 billion in assistance to build its security forces. Make Afghanistan Great Again As Afghanistan’s neighbors work to insulate themselves from the country’s possible implosion, the U.S.-backed Afghan government continues to do itself no favors in the fight against the Taliban. Afghanistan’s western-educated President Ashraf Ghani was thought to have transcended the authoritarianism, irredentist revisionism, and myopic tribalism of his country’s elite. But he has instead quickly internalized those characteristics. Ghani began his tenure with a courageous attempt at striking a new chapter in relations with Pakistan, which eventually brought the Taliban to the negotiation table—but the process was sabotaged by members of his government. Since then, Ghani has reverted to a posture that only reinforces Pakistan’s distrust of Afghanistan’s leadership. Like his predecessor, Hamid Karzai, Ghani has opposed Pakistani attempts to fence the border, though it would benefit Afghanistan as well. Ghani proclaimed before an audience in Afghanistan that “every attempt at dividing the nation would fail.” By “nation,” Ghani meant Pashtuns in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. This hypernationalist rhetoric is the norm for Afghan leaders. Amrullah Saleh, the former Afghan intelligence chief, recently beseeched Trump to recognize the Pakistani city of Peshawar as an Afghan city in the same way he recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Nearly half of Afghanistan could fall into Taliban hands, but Afghanistan’s power elite fantasize about a Greater Afghanistan based on maps from the nineteenth century. They boast of five thousand years of history, but they have little modern-day achievements to show for. Afghanistan’s empty pride has yielded empty hands. American largesse, which has made illiterate warlords into millionaires, and Washington’s messaging strategy in Afghanistan, which reinforces Afghan animosity toward its neighbors (who are there to stay), have only fed the country’s pathologies. Goodbye Unity, Hello ISIS To thwart and eventually defeat the Taliban insurgency, Afghanistan needs a legitimate government not at war with itself. Afghanistan’s present “national unity government”—led by Ghani with his election opponent Abdullah Abdullah as “chief executive officer”—was forged through a settlement brokered in 2014 by then-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. In the words of Kerry, with the deal, Afghanistan avoided a civil war. Since coming into power, Ghani has: reneged on his agreement with Abdullah to enact political reforms (though relations have recently improved); played non-Pashtun politicians off of one another as he attempts to centralize power; and twice-delayed parliamentary elections. Ghani is pushing the country toward civil conflict and creating greater space not just for the Taliban, but also for the so-called Islamic State. Last year, Ghani forced his first vice president, Abdul Rashid Dostum, a warlord from the Jowzjan Province, into exile after he ordered his guards to rape a political rival after he was “physically incapable of doing so.” While Dostum is a detestable figure, his absence has left a power vacuum. Militiamen once under his control have now joined the Islamic State and the Taliban in the Jowzjan province. French fighters affiliated with the Islamic State somehow have made their way into the region. To the east of Jowzjan lies the province of Balkh, one of the few provinces that has withstood the Taliban’s ground offensive and where Ghani has unwisely picked another political battle. In December, Ghani effectively fired Atta Noor, the warlord who served as the province’s governor. Early last year, Ghani engaged Noor in talks as part of a bid to sideline the country’s “chief executive officer” Abdullah. By the year’s end, Ghani sacked Noor (by accepting the resignation letter Noor provided earlier in the year as collateral). Noor has since rejected his own resignation and ordered the arrest of the man appointed to replace him as governor. Now, there are rumors that Ghani could fire Abdul Raziq Achakzai, the warlord who has kept Kandahar from going the way of the Taliban and has recently supported Noor. Achakzai, whose forces drill holes in the heads of detainees, recently declared: “I was not appointed by this government, and it cannot fire me.” In June, he was photographed with the commander of U.S. forces, Gen. John Nicholson. The Trump administration has looked away as Ghani has engaged in a domestic “game of thrones” while his country is on fire. This is partly because generals run the show in Kabul and Washington and a neutered State Department has been unable to restrain Ghani. The Trump cabinet includes three generals and an uninfluential secretary of state keen on depleting his organization. It took the Trump administration six months to nominate an ambassador to Afghanistan. During that time, it dismantled the State Department’s Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan office. Avoiding Chaos The general consensus among U.S. observers of Afghanistan is that the Taliban is too strong to be defeated militarily, but it is not strong enough to take over the whole country. But infighting among Afghanistan’s power elite, much like in Vietnam, or for that matter, in Afghanistan when the Taliban first took over, could be the straw the breaks the camel’s back. The Army of the Republic of Vietnam, lest we forget, was a formidable fighting force—far more capable than Afghan army today.

Afghanistan, in comparison, has around two hundred posts along the border with Pakistan. There is a four hundred mile stretch in southern Afghanistan where the Afghan government has no border posts—astonishing for a country that complains of cross-border insurgent inflows and has received $70 billion in assistance to build its security forces. Make Afghanistan Great Again As Afghanistan’s neighbors work to insulate themselves from the country’s possible implosion, the U.S.-backed Afghan government continues to do itself no favors in the fight against the Taliban. Afghanistan’s western-educated President Ashraf Ghani was thought to have transcended the authoritarianism, irredentist revisionism, and myopic tribalism of his country’s elite. But he has instead quickly internalized those characteristics. Ghani began his tenure with a courageous attempt at striking a new chapter in relations with Pakistan, which eventually brought the Taliban to the negotiation table—but the process was sabotaged by members of his government. Since then, Ghani has reverted to a posture that only reinforces Pakistan’s distrust of Afghanistan’s leadership. Like his predecessor, Hamid Karzai, Ghani has opposed Pakistani attempts to fence the border, though it would benefit Afghanistan as well. Ghani proclaimed before an audience in Afghanistan that “every attempt at dividing the nation would fail.” By “nation,” Ghani meant Pashtuns in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. This hypernationalist rhetoric is the norm for Afghan leaders. Amrullah Saleh, the former Afghan intelligence chief, recently beseeched Trump to recognize the Pakistani city of Peshawar as an Afghan city in the same way he recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Nearly half of Afghanistan could fall into Taliban hands, but Afghanistan’s power elite fantasize about a Greater Afghanistan based on maps from the nineteenth century. They boast of five thousand years of history, but they have little modern-day achievements to show for. Afghanistan’s empty pride has yielded empty hands. American largesse, which has made illiterate warlords into millionaires, and Washington’s messaging strategy in Afghanistan, which reinforces Afghan animosity toward its neighbors (who are there to stay), have only fed the country’s pathologies. Goodbye Unity, Hello ISIS To thwart and eventually defeat the Taliban insurgency, Afghanistan needs a legitimate government not at war with itself. Afghanistan’s present “national unity government”—led by Ghani with his election opponent Abdullah Abdullah as “chief executive officer”—was forged through a settlement brokered in 2014 by then-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. In the words of Kerry, with the deal, Afghanistan avoided a civil war. Since coming into power, Ghani has: reneged on his agreement with Abdullah to enact political reforms (though relations have recently improved); played non-Pashtun politicians off of one another as he attempts to centralize power; and twice-delayed parliamentary elections. Ghani is pushing the country toward civil conflict and creating greater space not just for the Taliban, but also for the so-called Islamic State. Last year, Ghani forced his first vice president, Abdul Rashid Dostum, a warlord from the Jowzjan Province, into exile after he ordered his guards to rape a political rival after he was “physically incapable of doing so.” While Dostum is a detestable figure, his absence has left a power vacuum. Militiamen once under his control have now joined the Islamic State and the Taliban in the Jowzjan province. French fighters affiliated with the Islamic State somehow have made their way into the region. To the east of Jowzjan lies the province of Balkh, one of the few provinces that has withstood the Taliban’s ground offensive and where Ghani has unwisely picked another political battle. In December, Ghani effectively fired Atta Noor, the warlord who served as the province’s governor. Early last year, Ghani engaged Noor in talks as part of a bid to sideline the country’s “chief executive officer” Abdullah. By the year’s end, Ghani sacked Noor (by accepting the resignation letter Noor provided earlier in the year as collateral). Noor has since rejected his own resignation and ordered the arrest of the man appointed to replace him as governor. Now, there are rumors that Ghani could fire Abdul Raziq Achakzai, the warlord who has kept Kandahar from going the way of the Taliban and has recently supported Noor. Achakzai, whose forces drill holes in the heads of detainees, recently declared: “I was not appointed by this government, and it cannot fire me.” In June, he was photographed with the commander of U.S. forces, Gen. John Nicholson. The Trump administration has looked away as Ghani has engaged in a domestic “game of thrones” while his country is on fire. This is partly because generals run the show in Kabul and Washington and a neutered State Department has been unable to restrain Ghani. The Trump cabinet includes three generals and an uninfluential secretary of state keen on depleting his organization. It took the Trump administration six months to nominate an ambassador to Afghanistan. During that time, it dismantled the State Department’s Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan office. Avoiding Chaos The general consensus among U.S. observers of Afghanistan is that the Taliban is too strong to be defeated militarily, but it is not strong enough to take over the whole country. But infighting among Afghanistan’s power elite, much like in Vietnam, or for that matter, in Afghanistan when the Taliban first took over, could be the straw the breaks the camel’s back. The Army of the Republic of Vietnam, lest we forget, was a formidable fighting force—far more capable than Afghan army today.

News article:
Topic: Security Region: Asia Tags: AfghanistanWarTerrorismTalibanDonald Trump Afghanistan’s old wounds—no longer bandaged by U.S. dollar bills—are opening once again. President Donald Trump rang in the new year with a Twitter salvo directed at Pakistan, claiming that Washington has given Islamabad more than $33 billion in aid after 9/11, but has only received “lies and deceit” in return. The administration has since announced the suspension of military assistance to Pakistan. An unnamed State Department official has described the suspension as reversible should the Pakistani military take desired action against the Haqqani Network. The Trump administration appears to be moving toward a strategy of compellence toward Pakistan. It may be nonviolent right now, but could include lethal covert action, both visible (e.g. drone attacks) and less visible, and yield a series of unintended consequences that push the bilateral relationship beyond the point of no return. The asymmetries of the U.S.-Pakistan relationship may drive some in Washington to believe in the promise of compellence. But these asymmetries are counterveiled by mutual dependencies and other factors, including geography and salience. The United States does the cause of stabilizing Afghanistan no good by externalizing blame for the failing war or attributing it to a single insurgent network. The future of Afghanistan is bleak. Regardless of what American officials say, the United States can easily walk away from Afghanistan without injuring itself. But it is regional states that will bear the fallout from the disaster unfolding in Afghanistan—a disaster that has American and Afghan fingerprints all over it. The cycle of violence in Afghanistan is moving in an untenable direction. The Taliban now control or contest over 43 percent of Afghanistan’s districts, encompassing most of the outer perimeter of the country. Civilian deaths due to coalition bombing rise. Afghan security forces are dying in record-breaking numbers. Washington is arming more unwieldy militias with weapons. The documented Afghan economy has come to a standstill. Economic growth is surpassed by population growth. But drug production soars. Worst of all, Afghanistan’s leaders are heading toward confrontation with one another as the Trump administration looks on vainglorious and indolent. The bitter truth about Afghanistan is this: the relative stability Afghanistan experienced in the initial years post–9/11 will likely prove to be an exception, not the rule, in the country’s post–1973 history. Afghanistan’s old wounds—no longer bandaged by U.S. dollar bills—are opening once again. They, along with a resilient insurgency, will consume the country. American introspection combined with cooperation with regional states may stave off an ugly civil war in Afghanistan. The Region Speaks Recent actions by regional states amount to a vote of no confidence in the U.S.-led strategy for Afghanistan. Virtually all of Afghanistan’s neighbors are taking active measures to prevent instability and violence from the country spilling into their own. Last month, Tajikistan closed its border with northern Afghanistan after two of its border police officers were killed by Afghan drug traffickers. During this period, Russia delivered military hardware to the Tajik border with Afghanistan, to help Dushanbe control the border region. In December, China—Afghanistan’s neighbor to the northeast—said that it would provide $85 million to support a mountainous Afghan army brigade to secure the border province of Badakhshan, the former anti-Taliban bastion where the militant group has made significant inroads since 2013. Chinese security forces have reportedly been conducting patrols inside Badakhshan since at least 2016. There is also trouble in western Afghanistan. In late December, a commander with Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps claimed that Tehran conducted a unilateral operation in Afghan territory to free an Iranian captive. The Taliban have a strong presence along Afghanistan’s western frontier with Iran—due in part to support from Iranian intelligence. And then there is Pakistan—the locus of Trump’s ire—which will spend over $100 million to fence its border with Afghanistan and line it with additional security posts. Pakistan presently has roughly one thousand posts along its border with Afghanistan and will add hundreds more. It will sustain a troop presence of around two hundred thousand along the Afghan border, complemented by the paramilitary Frontier Corps. Afghanistan, in comparison, has around two hundred posts along the border with Pakistan. There is a four hundred mile stretch in southern Afghanistan where the Afghan government has no border posts—astonishing for a country that complains of cross-border insurgent inflows and has received $70 billion in assistance to build its security forces.

News article:
ISLAMABAD: Minister for Defence Engineer Khurram Dastgir Khan on Tuesday said that intelligence and defence cooperation with the United States (US) had been suspended and it was high time for Pakistan to have 'ruthlessly candid dialogue' with the US with everything on the table. He was speaking at a pubic talk entitled "Contours of Security Environment in Pakistan" organised here at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI). Khurram Dastgir said that US, in spite of spending billions of dollars and getting its soldiers killed, could not win the Afghan war as it had only managed to control 40 percent of Afghanistan during the last 15 years. "America needs to deal with that ungoverned area before it points fingers towards Pakistan's role in Afghan peace process," he added. "US military aid suspension to Pakistan has no importance. At the same time, strategic dialogue between the two countries has also faced suspension for last two years. High level dialogues with US would not work until resumption and consistency in working level dialogues," he said. Khurram Dastgir said that US allegations and illogical demands have affected serious the efforts, made by Pakistan to ensure peace in region as well as the world. He said sacrifices of Pakistan in war against terrorism were above board and it would not allow anyone to make it a scapegoat and bring Afghan war on its soil. He said Pakistan had been facing challenges where it had been confronting with external threat on eastern border with India and facing internal threat due to terrorism. The minister said the successful conduct of operation with Zarb-e-Azb and ongoing Raddul Fasaad had made Pakistan and region a citadel of peace. Replying to a question, he said presence of Afghan refugees in large number in Pakistan was also another cause of internal instability. The decision of extension for a month stay of Afghan refugees in Pakistan has been taken by the Cabinet, he added. The minister said a sustainable peace in Afghanistan was part of Pakistan's foreign policy. Answering another question, Khurram Dastgir said Pakistan and China were partners and all weather friends. Multi-billion dollars project of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) would bring development and prosperity, not only in Pakistan but also in the region. "CPEC is the first ever project in history of Pak-China relationship that will actually bring economical success to region," he added. Regarding Indian hostile attitude, he said, Pakistan desires solution of all outstanding issue with India but its aggression along the Line of Control (LoC) and Working Boundary was a matter of concern. He said US deemed India as its strategic partner in region, and it has been trying to convince Pakistan not to see India as a threat while Pakistan clearly sees India as a threat to its peace and stability. Khurram said the bilateral relations with regional countries like Russia and Iran were improving. "Pak-Russia conducted joint military exercises. Visit of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) to Tehran is proving to be step forward in strengthening mutual relationship with regional countries," he said. In his concluding remarks, Chairman Ambassador Khalid Mahmood said that world should not ignore Pakistan's sacrifices in war against terrorism. Pakistan has been a front line state in this war and Pakistanis have bought this peace with their blood, he added. Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad is denying Pakistan’s claims it has suspended military or intelligence cooperation with the United States. Embassy spokesman Richard Snelsire said, “We have not received any formal communication regarding a suspension.”

News article:
Reports emerged this week that more than 10,000 Afghan fighters deployed by Iran to defend the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad have been killed or injured in the past five years. Fazal Hadi Muslimyar, chairman of Meshrano Jirga, has said, “Iran is abusing Afghan refugees and sending them to the war in Syria and Iraq, where more than 2,000 Afghans have been killed,” he told lawmakers on January 9. “I am calling on the Afghan president, the chief executive, and the Foreign Affairs Ministry to lodge a complaint with the Iranian ambassador on this matter.” Muslimyar had criticized the Afghan government for refusing to actively pursue the issue on the diplomatic front on the previous day. He told Radio Free Afghanistan, “They should formally complain and seek help from the members of the United Nations Security Council with whom we have strategic security agreements.” His call for a diplomatic initiative is backed by fellow lawmakers, like Aryan Yoon, a female member of Wolesi Jirga or lower house of the Afghan Parliament. “Kabul should suspend its bilateral relations with Tehran,” she told Radio Free Afghanistan. “The Afghan government also needs to raise this issue at international forums and even lodge formal complaints with international bodies that Iran is interfering in its domestic affairs and abusing refugees.” Lawmaker Abdul Qadir Zazai Watandost says Wolesi Jirga’s foreign relations committee is investigating the issue. “This issue will be part of our general agenda after the winter recess [in February],” he said. An official for the Fatemiyoun Divison, Zohair Mojahed, said that since 2012 at least 10,000 Afghans have either been killed or wounded while fighting for al-Assad. He told Iran’s Shargh newspaper on January 6th, “This brigade has given more than 2,000 martyrs and 8,000 wounded for Islam.” Members of the Fatemiyoun Division are estimated to be some 20,000, most of whom were recruited from among Afghanistan’s Shi’ite Hazara minority. Deputy Afghan Chief Executive Mohammad Mohaqiq, a Hazara politician, came under fire last November for seeming to confirm that thousands of Afghan recruits are fighting in Syria on Iran’s behalf. “I thank all the warriors who cooperated in these wars from Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and other parts of the world,” Mohaqiq said at an event in Iran. He also praised Major General Qasem Soleimani, foreign operations commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, who is credited with founding the Fatemiyoun Division. Presidential spokesman Shah Hussain Murtazawi was critical. “We have repeatedly expressed our opposition to all kinds of proxy wars in Afghanistan,” he said. “Similarly, we oppose such wars everywhere. We do not want the blood of our children being spilled for foreign interests in other countries.” However, spokesman for the Afghan Foreign Ministry, Sibghatullah Ahmadi says Kabul has raised the issue with Tehran and the United Nations. He told Radio Free Afghanistan, “We have discussed this issue with the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the relevant Iranian authorities.” He added, “We hope the vulnerability of Afghan refugees is not being exploited and that our complaints are seriously addressed on time.” Tehran has not responded to complaints or criticism from Afghanistan. Still, Iranian media frequently reports on the funerals of Afghan fighters killed in Syria. Abdul Baqi Baryal, a member of Meshrano Jirga, is pushing for Kabul to address the issue immediately. According to what he told Radio Free Afghanistan, the Afghan Constitution allows the country’s citizens to only fight under its flag. “This is a very painful issue. We need to talk seriously about this with Iran soon,” he said.

News article:
Reports emerged this week that more than 10,000 Afghan fighters deployed by Iran to defend the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad have been killed or injured in the past five years. Fazal Hadi Muslimyar, chairman of Meshrano Jirga, has said, “Iran is abusing Afghan refugees and sending them to the war in Syria and Iraq, where more than 2,000 Afghans have been killed,” he told lawmakers on January 9. “I am calling on the Afghan president, the chief executive, and the Foreign Affairs Ministry to lodge a complaint with the Iranian ambassador on this matter.” Muslimyar had criticized the Afghan government for refusing to actively pursue the issue on the diplomatic front on the previous day. He told Radio Free Afghanistan, “They should formally complain and seek help from the members of the United Nations Security Council with whom we have strategic security agreements.” His call for a diplomatic initiative is backed by fellow lawmakers, like Aryan Yoon, a female member of Wolesi Jirga or lower house of the Afghan Parliament. “Kabul should suspend its bilateral relations with Tehran,” she told Radio Free Afghanistan. “The Afghan government also needs to raise this issue at international forums and even lodge formal complaints with international bodies that Iran is interfering in its domestic affairs and abusing refugees.” Lawmaker Abdul Qadir Zazai Watandost says Wolesi Jirga’s foreign relations committee is investigating the issue. “This issue will be part of our general agenda after the winter recess [in February],” he said. An official for the Fatemiyoun Divison, Zohair Mojahed, said that since 2012 at least 10,000 Afghans have either been killed or wounded while fighting for al-Assad. He told Iran’s Shargh newspaper on January 6th, “This brigade has given more than 2,000 martyrs and 8,000 wounded for Islam.” Members of the Fatemiyoun Division are estimated to be some 20,000, most of whom were recruited from among Afghanistan’s Shi’ite Hazara minority. Deputy Afghan Chief Executive Mohammad Mohaqiq, a Hazara politician, came under fire last November for seeming to confirm that thousands of Afghan recruits are fighting in Syria on Iran’s behalf. “I thank all the warriors who cooperated in these wars from Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and other parts of the world,” Mohaqiq said at an event in Iran. He also praised Major General Qasem Soleimani, foreign operations commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, who is credited with founding the Fatemiyoun Division. Presidential spokesman Shah Hussain Murtazawi was critical. “We have repeatedly expressed our opposition to all kinds of proxy wars in Afghanistan,” he said. “Similarly, we oppose such wars everywhere. We do not want the blood of our children being spilled for foreign interests in other countries.” However, spokesman for the Afghan Foreign Ministry, Sibghatullah Ahmadi says Kabul has raised the issue with Tehran and the United Nations. He told Radio Free Afghanistan, “We have discussed this issue with the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the relevant Iranian authorities.” He added, “We hope the vulnerability of Afghan refugees is not being exploited and that our complaints are seriously addressed on time.” Tehran has not responded to complaints or criticism from Afghanistan.

News article:
Pakistan is unlikely to expand its anti-terror fight despite the hardline approach taken by the Trump administration, with threats of further punitive measures to push it to destroy the alleged safe havens of the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network.The US has long been pushing Pakistan to deny space to the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network, but the pressure has never been so intense and visible as has been during last few days.Events of the past few days starting from Trump’s stinging tweet to suspend entire security assistance have suggested that Washington is willing to risk its 16-year alliance with Pakistan to get the job done in Afghanistan.It is believed that senior military officials through informal channels have already conveyed to the Pakistani military authorities about their ‘specific demands’.“Our expectations are straightforward,” Pentagon spokesman Colonel Rob Manning told reporters in Washington on Monday. “[The] Taliban and Haqqani leadership and attack planners should no longer be able to find safe haven or conduct operations from Pakistani soil,” he added.Although he did not share details, the US is thought to have identified ‘certain targets and specific actions’ that it wants from Pakistan to undertake in stipulated time frame.Pakistan was informed that timely action on the US demands would lead to immediate restoration of around $1 billion of security assistance that Washington suspended just days after Trump’s New Year tweet.But interaction with at least two senior Pakistani officials, who have direct knowledge of the issue, suggested that Pakistan was not going to accept any fresh US demands.Both the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told The Express Tribune that in Pakistan’s assessment there was no organised infrastructure of any militant outfit – including the Haqqani network.“Therefore, the US demand does not hold any ground,” said one of the officials, who gave a rare insight into thinking of the Pakistani policymakers in the wake of Trump’s onslaught.After the Trump’s tweet, the country’s civil and military leadership had three-hour-long discussions and consultations. One of the talking points was whether Pakistan could do more. However, there was consensus in the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting that Pakistan must not give in to the US pressure.Their decision was based on the fact that Pakistan had already done enough and any fresh commitment would be tantamount to accepting the oft-repeated allegations that Islamabad is responsible for the failures in Afghanistan.But the larger purpose behind Pakistan’s reluctance to accept US demands is attributed to its policy decision that solution to the Afghan problem hinges on sustained peace talks.And if there is a need of the use of force, such a decision has to be taken with consensus by taking on board other regional players including China, Russia and Iran, argued another official.But Pakistan’s position could antagonise the Trump administration, which may resort to further punitive measures. The US already made it clear that it would no more accept Pakistan’s current approach towards the fight against terrorism.Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) chief Mike Pompeo accused Pakistan of providing shelter to terrorists who target US citizens, saying this is "no longer going to be acceptable".But Pakistani authorities are confident that the Trump administration despite its rhetoric would not go beyond a certain point.Their confidence stems from the fact that Pakistan has considerable leverage over the US. The presence of around 14,000 US troops in Afghanistan means that they not only have to rely on Pakistan for key supply lines but also the Afghan endgame.Pakistan’s position has been endorsed by some of the senior American diplomats who served in Islamabad and have considerable experience and knowledge of the intricacies involved in the Afghan imbroglio.In an article published in The New York Times, former US ambassador Richard Olson admitted that the Trump’s new strategy on Pakistan had little chances of success.“While perhaps it is emotionally satisfying to penalise a country that has supported American enemies in Afghanistan for the past 16 years, the administration’s approach is unlikely to work. Pakistan has greater leverage over us than many imagine,” Olson wrote.He said the ultimate answer to the Pakistan conundrum was to start a diplomatic initiative to bring peace to Afghanistan by opening talks with the Taliban.“The Trump administration has publicly stated that it sees the conflict ending only through a negotiated solution. It is difficult to understand why no such diplomatic initiative had been started,” Olson concluded with an observation that ironically supports Pakistan viewpoint.Meanwhile, speaking at a seminar in Islamabad, Defence Minister Khurrum Dastagir disclosed that Pakistan had suspended military and intelligence cooperation with the United States in the wake of Trump's diatribe."Field of intelligence cooperation and defence cooperation which we have suspended and my colleague Khawja Asif correctly pointed that out," Kurrum said.However, he added that the ground and air lines of communications were still operational. "Its a leverage we want to use at an appropriate time," the minister further said hinting that Pakistan could suspend key supply lines for the US forces in Afghanistan.

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 complementary.

The image shows the cost of the war on terror to Pakistan. The news events set is about the US suspending aid to Pakistan and the UAE considering a vaccination policy. The image is complementary to the news events set because it provides additional information about the cost of the war on terror, which is a topic that is related to both news events.


News article:
In reference your story US suspending more than $255 million in security aid to Pakistan (January 5) and the harsh tweets by president Donald Trump about Pakistan not co-operating fully to control terrorism, Pakistan must be very upset with the halting of aid and the strong comments of Mr Trump. However there is an opportunity in every crisis. Pakistan should endeavour to generate its own resources to fight terrorism in the country. Why depend on money from other countries to manage law and order at home? Pakistan is rich in agriculture, industry and textiles. Pakistan should focus on exports and generate adequate revenues so that it is self-sufficient. Self-help is the best help. Rajendra Aneja, Dubai Iran needs new leadership Regarding your story US and France agree on Iran regime's failure to serve people (January 8), the time of bad government in Iran has to come to an end. There has to be a new system of politics working in the direction of peace. Asyah Elisabeth Meel, Abu Dhabi VAT threatens the agility of the UAE's economy In reference to your leader The Government's VAT pledge gives a taste of our economic future (January 8), VAT is a redistributionist construct, so it is not hard to understand why redistribution should be promoted as its benefit. What is hard to understand is that, given the golden opportunity of developing the UAE's post-oil economy, the authorities have chosen to adopt this tax, where the cost ends up in the lap of the consumer, with often the least able bearing the greatest burden on their net income. The UAE's economy needs its agility to compete in the global marketplace. Andy Preston, Abu Dhabi Good conduct certificates are good in theory, but will they work in practice? In response to your story UAE to introduce 'good conduct certificate' requirement for work visas (January 8), where do these certificates come from if you have been a resident working expat for 23 years in the UAE? Or a born-and-brought-up expat here who has never worked outside the country? Tanya Milbourne, Dubai The UAE authorities already perform a background check on expatriate workers, so how is this any different?

News article:
Defence Minister Khurram Dastagir on Monday asked the United States whether Pakistan should put a price tag on the Ground Line of Communications (GLOCs) and Air Line of Communications (ALOCs) which averages 314 daily with use of ports and air bases and other mutual communications.The minister was giving a policy statement in the National Assembly, where he gave an overarching picture of the country’s Defence and foreign policy.Dastagir stated that the way forward for the Pak-US relations was not through threats, notices and suspension of support.“This is Pakistani foreign policy and we have cleared safe havens from our country and are also removing the remnants but we are equally determined that the Afghan war will not be fought on Pakistani soil,” he said.The minister added that it was convenient for the US to blame Pakistan for its failure in pacifying Afghanistan, even though Washington had not pursued internal reconciliation seriously and instead the American fingers were on kill button.“The Trump administration has suspended strategic level dialogue with Pakistan, yet complains of failure of high level of communication which is bound to fail until backed up by consistent dialogue at the working level,” the minister said.Dastagir further told the assembly that it was time for courteous but ruthlessly candid dialogue between both the countries with everything on the table.The minister reminded the US of the sacrifices rendered by Pakistan’s armed forces and civilians and asked if we should put a price tag on it.He also asked the Afghan government and the US that should Pakistan also put a price tag for the three million Afghan refugees that it continues to host.Sharing his party’s line, he said the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) had started recalibration of Pakistan’s Defence and regional policy, and one of the new calibration was its recent relationship with Russia.“An opening has recently been achieved with Iran. The recent visit of chief of army staff has initiated a conversation that has been followed up by meetings of the two national security advisers.”While commenting about India, the minister stated that unremittingly hostile and anti-Pakistan stance taken by the current Indian government had drastically reduced the space for any advocacy of peace.“The escalation of Indian bombing on the Line of Control (LoC) has been matched with escalation in anti-Pakistan rhetoric which often descends to baiting and bashing,” he told the lawmakers.Meanwhile, right after the minister ended his statement, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and other parties termed the stance “confusing, flexible and vague.”PPP’s Naveed Qamar said the statement was harsh suggesting “we should tread carefully before raising the temperature.” He said the US could be irresponsible in the prevailing situation but Pakistan cannot afford to act the same way. “We also should know who is speaking for Pakistan, foreign office, civilian government or general headquarters,” he asked.PTI’s chief whip of the house Shireen Mazari said the statement had brought more confusion than clarity and asked why there was no rejection of the Indian army chief’s statement.She also castigated the government for hosting the US Acting Assistant Secretary of State Ambassador Alice Wells.“You are meeting a mid-ranking US official while it [US] has put you on a watchlist,” she said, adding GLOCs and ALOCs should be shut down as Pakistan was providing the facility for free.

News article:
India has once again ramped up tensions with Pakistan, with its army chief General Bipin Rawat accusing Pakistan of sending terrorists into India through the Line of Control and saying that his country would not hesitate to call our nuclear bluff. Rawat’s irresponsible war-mongering, which has become typical of the Narendra Modi government, has been immediately condemned in Pakistan by the Senate and the DG of ISPR. The Indian general’s later statement – that India will need to solve the Kashmir issue – was seen by some as a softening of his stance, although the fact that he did not mention Pakistan in the context of Kashmir is notable. India has always maintained the pretence that Kashmir is an internal issue and there has been no change in that stance. Just how aggressive India is now becoming can be seen in the military deals concluded during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the country. Modi has specifically asked Netanyahu to invest more in India’s defence sector. The nexus between the two countries – both of which are international scofflaws illegally occupying territory – will only lower the chances of peace with Pakistan. India’s aggression can only be compounded now that it is allying itself so closely to Netanyahu – a man who never saw a Muslim-majority nation he didn’t advocate war against. The rapid deterioration in ties between Pakistan and India, despite the PML-N coming into power and advocating for peace, has been accompanied by a similar trajectory in our relationship with the US. From the time of his campaign trail, Donald Trump had been an advocate for India, and the general trajectory the US has been on had already brought it closer to the Indians. Trump has faithfully repeated the India line on Pakistan’s supposed support for militant groups. In what may be seen as some damage control effort, US Acting Assistant Secretary for State Alice Wells became the first American to visit Pakistan after Trump tweeted threats about cutting off all aid – and then did cut some aid. Well’s meetings with Pakistani officials have been appropriately fraught. It seems we are now turning the tables on the US and demanding it do more to take on militant groups like the TTP which are based in Afghanistan and regularly carry out attacks on our soil. Pakistan has long maintained that India has used its considerable influence in Afghanistan to foment militancy in this country, and the US has always turned a blind eye to this. The Centcom chief did phone Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa a few days back and was conciliatory in acknowledging that we have suffered because of superpower wars in Afghanistan. Such words of understanding, though, hold little weight so long as the US and its Indian allies continue their aggressive posturing in both words and deed.

MNA – Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan Raza Rabbani said Wed. that the US has been using Pakistan as a ‘scapegoat’ due to its recent losses in the Middle East, adding that Pakistan has paid a high price since then. Ali Larijani sat with the Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan Raza Rabbani on the sidelines of the 13th session of Parliamentary Union of the OIC Member States (PUIC) Conference on Wednesday in Tehran. During the meeting, the Pakistani official slammed Washington’s approach in using his country as a ‘scapegoat’ due to the Western country’s recent losses in the Middle East region, adding “we have paid a high price for this. The US even cut off its military assistance to us due to our vote in condemnation of Trump’s decision to relocate US embassy to Jerusalem.” He also touched upon the good relations between Iran and Pakistan, noting that the Wednesday visit was his second in the last six months with Iranian Parliament Speaker, Ali Larijani. He further expressed hope that the PUIC’s statement that would be released today at the end of the conference would further strengthen relations among the Muslim countries. Ali Larijani, for his part, noted the common enemies facing Iran and Pakistan, calling for stronger relations between the two sides in a bid to foil any disruptive plot hatched by the US. Larijani also called for development of economic and security cooperation with Pakistan, saying the rise in the level of cooperation in the past few months indicates the appropriate decisions made by the two countries.

Ali Larijani, for his part, noted the common enemies facing Iran and Pakistan, calling for stronger relations between the two sides in a bid to foil any disruptive plot hatched by the US. Larijani also called for development of economic and security cooperation with Pakistan, saying the rise in the level of cooperation in the past few months indicates the appropriate decisions made by the two countries.

News article:
Relations between Pakistan and the US plunged to an all-time low after US President Donald Trump’s Twitter outburst against Pakistan on January 1. Subsequent actions by the US president to block dispersal of most aid to the country only made matters worse. The optimist’s view would be that ties had reached such a low that the two countries would have no option but to give diplomacy a chance lest the relationship be abandoned altogether. That is exactly what the US and Pakistan have now tried to do with the visit of Alice Wells, the US State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs’ principal deputy assistant secretary. Wells met with the civilian leadership during her stay in Pakistan and had some encouraging words to offer. She acknowledged the sacrifices Pakistan has made in fighting militancy, and pointed to intelligence-sharing and working towards a political settlement in Pakistan as ways in which the two countries could have a productive partnership. Her visit was a sign that the two countries will not entirely go their own way yet. But no amount of diplomatic niceties can change the fact that there has been an irrevocable change in ties. Wells has pointed out that there has been a shift to a new relationship, one where the US is engaged with us only so long as it is in its own interests. While that has always been a staple of US foreign policy, the Trump administration has been more open about it. For Pakistan, too, there is now less of a need to be stuck in a relationship that is no longer working for the country. After Wells’ visit, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said that we will have to survive without US aid so that we never again have to hear the taunts and insults of the US. The truth is that Pakistan is far less reliant on US aid than before, with China having stepped into the breach. We also need to understand that such diplomatic exchanges do not change the reality that American interests in the region are irrevocably tilted towards India. That was amply demonstrated by the fact that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was visiting India while Wells was in Karachi. The US-Israel-India nexus, focused on trade, investment and security cooperation, is a reminder that in today’s world US alliances have a decidedly anti-Pakistan nature. In India, Netanyahu has drawn common cause with India, saying both India and his own country face the problem of Islamist extremists. For these two countries, ‘Islamist extremism’ is the euphemism used to violently suppress the liberation movements in Palestine and Kashmir. India is also determined to convince the world that Pakistan is the prime sponsor of terrorism in the region, something it will now do with the backing of the US and Israel. Against this backdrop, any improvements in our relations with the US are likely to be temporary and not lead to any genuine breakthroughs.

News article:
Throughout the Cold War, Pakistan has been an instrumental US ally in south and central Asia. And the close relationship has continued in the years after. Pakistan has been key to the US efforts in Afghanistan since 2001, as the only reliable staging post in a region squeezed between Iran and China. In the service of this alliance, the US has supported Pakistan through thick and thin, through military dictatorships, through developing their own nuclear arsenal and through successive scandals involving Pakistan’s notorious ISI intelligence agency, and their dubious activities. Advertisement But in recent months, the ISI’s indiscretions and the tacit support they seem to have received from the military and political leadership of the country appear to have led the US to threaten to more or less cut ties with Pakistan. The transgressions which are motivating this move are Pakistan’s support for terrorist groups, and its duplicitous game of friend or foe it alternatively plays with the US and the Taliban. A recent point of contention has been the release from prison in Pakistan of Hafiz Saeed, the alleged mastermind behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Pakistan insists there is not enough evidence against him to try him in court, despite the fact that India has produced and handed over to the Pakistani authorities what they call “considerable evidence”. Saeed’s lawyers claim that no such evidence has been presented in court. This is very much in keeping with Pakistan’s history of supporting and protecting all manner of radical Islamist extremists. This historical policy has backfired spectacularly, as ordinary Pakistanis have suffered from radical Islamist terrorism more than any other intended target, but there is no denying that the ISI in particular has been keen to cultivate and protect Islamist terrorist agents to direct against India and Afghanistan. Yet Pakistan has also traditionally yielded when the US applied pressure on them for such activities. In normal circumstances, when the US would have called for an individual such as Saeed to be “prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law”, they would have followed suit. Not so today. There are a number of reasons for why this is so. The relationship between the US and Pakistan has never truly recovered after the bin Laden episode. It remains as inconceivable today as it was in 2011 that the leader of al-Qaida had lived safely, for so many years in hiding in Pakistan. And not just anywhere, but in a large compound in the large city of Abbottabad, less than a mile away from the Pakistan Military Academy. An alliance requires trust. And that trust has never been re-established. A buffer for Iranian influence Then, there is the fact that the US has largely withdrawn from Afghanistan. It retains no particular strategic interests in the region beyond, perhaps, containing Iran. But even so, Pakistan and Iran are natural opponents on national and sectarian grounds, so Pakistan would be expected to continue to serve as a buffer for Iranian influence with or without US support. So the US is keen to extricate itself from the complicated and damaging relation it has with Pakistan, and is currently repositioning itself as more favourable to India: a bigger economic partner, and a more reliable counter-weight to Chinese expansion in Asia. Pakistan no longer feels itself beholden to American desires. And the US does not care enough to flex its muscle and get its way. Azeem Ibrahim But the crucial part of this is Pakistan’s own relationship with China. Whereas for most of its post-independence history, Pakistan has relied on US support against India and Iran, currently, the country is drifting ever more clearly into the Chinese sphere of influence. China is investing massively into infrastructure in the country as part of their New Silk Road initiative so that their access to the Western markets avoids the contentious Straights of Malacca. This investment is responsible for driving most of the current economic growth in Pakistan, as well as the increasing conditions ordinary Pakistanis are seeing along the Chinese-built economic corridor. The entire political and military establishment are also behind these new developments. In other words, the US is happy to retreat from Pakistan, and Pakistan is happy to move on to a closer relationship with China. The case of Hafiz Saeed may become emblematic of this shift. The rational thing to do about this case would be to hand him over to a court in a respected independent country agreeable to all parties, or maybe something like the ICC. If he were found not-guilty, that would vindicate Pakistan’s long standing claim that India is accusing it of terrorism without any basis. If he were found guilty, Pakistan would be confirmed as a state-sponsor of terror. But of course, no such thing will happen. Pakistan no longer feels itself beholden to American desires. And the US does not care enough to flex its muscle and get its way. It seems the two countries are having an amicable enough parting of ways. And the victims of Mumbai will be denied justice in the process.

News article:
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has given new timeline to both Pakistan and India for filing another round of memorials in the case of convicted Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav, sources have revealed to The Express Tribune.Sources revealed that the ICJ has set April 17 for India to file another memorial, while Pakistan will have to submit a counter memorial by July 17.In view of the timeline, they also informed that there is little chance that the hearing of the case will resume in 2018, adding that the two-month summer vacations of ICJ judges will start in August, and when it ended, the court will take up cases that have already been fixed before it.Earlier, New Delhi sought time to file an additional memorial at the ICJ. Legal experts are, however, wondering why India is trying to unnecessarily drag the matter.While submitting a 1,700-page counter memorial in the ICJ on December 13 last year, Pakistan rejected the Indian objection of not giving consular access to Jadhav, saying the provision of such access under the Vienna Convention is only for legitimate visitors, and not spies.Pakistan said that since India did not deny that Jadhav was travelling with an assumed Muslim name, they have no case to plead.India has repeatedly sought consular access to Jadhav, but Pakistan has turned down its requests, citing a bilateral accord that does not permit such access to spies.However, on December 25, Islamabad allowed Jadhav’s mother and wife to meet with him on purely humanitarian grounds.It was learnt that the government has also sought legal assistance from two top lawyers of the country. The initial memorial was drafted by Khawar Qureshi.According to sources, Pakistan stated in the memorial that India did not explain how a serving naval commander, operating under India’s spy agency – Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) – was travelling under an assumed name. This leads to only one conclusion, that India seeks consular access to the information he [Jadhav] had gathered, it added.It said since Jadhav was on active duty, it is obvious that he was a spy sent on a special mission.“Only a state that adheres to legitimate actions can request the court to intervene in a matter between two states. A state which does not come with clean hands cannot get any relief,” Pakistan contended.Pakistan further said that sending Jadhav for espionage and funding terrorist activities were some of the reasons that disentitle India from invoking jurisdiction of the ICJ.Sources said Pakistan also highlighted constant violations of human rights by India in occupied Kashmir. It said India is a habitual violator of human rights and has not honoured the UN resolutions on Kashmir.“Giving false identity to Kulbhushan, sending him for espionage and funding of terrorists activities are all some of the reasons which disentitle India from invoking the jurisdiction of the ICJ,” said the counter memorial according to a source. The ICJ will decide the schedule of hearing within 15 days.On September 13 last year, India submitted a 22-page memorandum wherein it objected to Jadhav being tried by a military court in Pakistan.The sources said India contended that Jadhav’s trial should have been conducted by a civilian court and that Pakistan was bound to give him consular access.The federal government has already appointed former chief justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani as an ad hoc judge for the case at The Hague.Legal experts are urging all stakeholders to increase coordination in devising the final draft of the memorandum.The ICJ on May 18 last year halted the execution of Jadhav, who was sentenced to death by a military court on April 10 after being convicted on charges of terrorism and espionage.Jadhav alias Hussain Mubarak Patel was apprehended on March 3, 2016, after he illegally crossed into Pakistan via Iran border.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has given new timeline to both Pakistan and India for filing another round of memorials in the case of convicted Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav, sources have revealed to The Express Tribune.Sources revealed that the ICJ has set April 17 for India to file another memorial, while Pakistan will have to submit a counter memorial by July 17.In view of the timeline, they also informed that there is little chance that the hearing of the case will resume in 2018, adding that the two-month summer vacations of ICJ judges will start in August, and when it ended, the court will take up cases that have already been fixed before it.Earlier, New Delhi sought time to file an additional memorial at the ICJ. Legal experts are, however, wondering why India is trying to unnecessarily drag the matter.While submitting a 1,700-page counter memorial in the ICJ on December 13 last year, Pakistan rejected the Indian objection of not giving consular access to Jadhav, saying the provision of such access under the Vienna Convention is only for legitimate visitors, and not spies.Pakistan said that since India did not deny that Jadhav was travelling with an assumed Muslim name, they have no case to plead.India has repeatedly sought consular access to Jadhav, but Pakistan has turned down its requests, citing a bilateral accord that does not permit such access to spies.However, on December 25, Islamabad allowed Jadhav’s mother and wife to meet with him on purely humanitarian grounds.It was learnt that the government has also sought legal assistance from two top lawyers of the country. The initial memorial was drafted by Khawar Qureshi.According to sources, Pakistan stated in the memorial that India did not explain how a serving naval commander, operating under India’s spy agency – Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) – was travelling under an assumed name. This leads to only one conclusion, that India seeks consular access to the information he [Jadhav] had gathered, it added.It said since Jadhav was on active duty, it is obvious that he was a spy sent on a special mission.“Only a state that adheres to legitimate actions can request the court to intervene in a matter between two states. A state which does not come with clean hands cannot get any relief,” Pakistan contended.Pakistan further said that sending Jadhav for espionage and funding terrorist activities were some of the reasons that disentitle India from invoking jurisdiction of the ICJ.Sources said Pakistan also highlighted constant violations of human rights by India in occupied Kashmir. It said India is a habitual violator of human rights and has not honoured the UN resolutions on Kashmir.“Giving false identity to Kulbhushan, sending him for espionage and funding of terrorists activities are all some of the reasons which disentitle India from invoking the jurisdiction of the ICJ,” said the counter memorial according to a source. The ICJ will decide the schedule of hearing within 15 days.On September 13 last year, India submitted a 22-page memorandum wherein it objected to Jadhav being tried by a military court in Pakistan.The sources said India contended that Jadhav’s trial should have been conducted by a civilian court and that Pakistan was bound to give him consular access.The federal government has already appointed former chief justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani as an ad hoc judge for the case at The Hague.Legal experts are urging all stakeholders to increase coordination in devising the final draft of the memorandum.The ICJ on May 18 last year halted the execution of Jadhav, who was sentenced to death by a military court on April 10 after being convicted on charges of terrorism and espionage.Jadhav alias Hussain Mubarak Patel was apprehended on March 3, 2016, after he illegally crossed into Pakistan via Iran border.

News article:
https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/11769/us-pakistan-divorce U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent denunciation of Pakistan’s “lies and deceit” is long overdue. Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawajah Asif’s retort — “We do not have any alliance” with the U.S. — appears to administer the last rites to a relationship long battered by mistrust. Are there, however, sufficient U.S. interests served by maintaining military cooperation with Pakistan, despite the contentious relationship? Pakistan’s two-faced role in joining the U.S.-led war on terror, while at the same time giving sanctuary and assistance to terrorist groups, was apparent even before the 9/11 attack on America and continues to this day. President Trump’s decision to withhold military aid may cause Pakistani intelligence agencies to be even less cooperative than they were in the past in assisting U.S. forces deployed to Afghanistan. Moreover, Pakistan’s commercial, economic, and investment interests appear now more closely aligned with China. It is also in America’s interest to end its own double game of attempting to be allied with both India and Pakistan, countries that are mortal enemies; it would be wise to choose India over Pakistan. As the world’s most populous democracy, India shares U.S. liberal democratic values. Its power in Asia is exceeded only by that of China, America’s principal competitor in the Pacific. The recent liberation by Pakistani troops of an American family — kidnapped five years ago in Afghanistan by Pakistan-based terrorists — should not be seen as a decision to cooperate more fully with the U.S.-led war on Islamic terrorism. U.S. Navy SEALs were ready to liberate the hostages in the event that Pakistan refused to do so. Reports suggest that U.S. intelligence passed to Pakistan the exact location of the hostages, making it difficult for the Pakistanis not to act. Consequently, Pakistan, as an alleged ally of the U.S., had little choice but to assist. The terrorist group holding the hostages, the Haqqani Network, has close operational planning links to Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). These links between Pakistan and the Haqqani Network and other terrorist groups, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, underscore the untrustworthy nature of such a professed ally. Ironically, it is arguable that America’s greatest enemy in the region is not al-Qaeda, but Pakistan. Afghanistan’s former spy chief, Amrullah Saleh, seems to agree. He assessed that “the amount of pain that Pakistan has inflicted upon the United States in the last 12 years is unprecedented.” So why should we be surprised that Osama bin Laden’s hideaway was in Abbottabad, less than a 30-minute drive from Pakistan’s “West Point,” the Pakistan Military Academy at Kakul? U.S. policymakers should not have been surprised — if they were — at Pakistan’s decision to give refuge to bin Laden. In the years prior to 9/11, Pakistan was one of only three countries to have diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. And, as host to al-Qaeda, the Taliban offered the infrastructure to support the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Pakistan’s ISI continues to sponsor, equip, and train several terrorist organizations that directly target American troops in Afghanistan, as well as regional allies of the United States, such as India. Groups such as the Afghan Taliban and its subsidiary, the Haqqani Network, are considered assets by the ISI to help Pakistan accomplish its goals in Afghanistan, one of which is to create enough instability to prevent its rival, India, from gaining influence there. The Haqqani Network also continues hostile operations against the U.S. military. Other terrorist groups, such as the Pakistani-supported Lashkar-e-Taiba, too are employed by Pakistan’s ISI to commit terrorist acts against Pakistan’s regional archrival, India. Pakistan does cooperate with the U.S., however, when American troops target those terrorist groups that Pakistan’s ISI does not control — those working to overthrow the Pakistani state. Most of these groups operate out of Northwest Pakistan’s remote Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), regions that have never been under complete control of the central government. Pakistan also has a poor record on controlling nuclear proliferation. As is well known, the scientist most responsible for Pakistan’s development of nuclear weapons capability, Abdul Qadeer Khan, disseminated technical information that aided the nuclear programs of North Korea and Iran, both of which are long-time adversaries of the United States. Given the critical nature of his research, Khan could not have acted so freely without protection from high-ranking Pakistani intelligence officers. It matters not whether Khan was motivated by greed or ideology; his deeds dealt a severe blow to the U.S. effort to keep nuclear weapons knowledge from the world’s rogue nations, such as Iran and North Korea. Pakistan is not a democracy, despite its current regularly-scheduled elections. It remains a violent, intolerant society in which religious minorities, such as Shia Muslims and Christians, are under constant threat of persecution. In fact, not a week goes by without a massacre of minorities in some part of the country. There is little doubt, then, that Pakistan is more enemy than ally, and acts more like a rogue state than a responsible member of the family of nations. So why does the U.S. continue to have normal relations with Pakistan? To what end does the U.S. continue its military cooperation? What U.S. national security interest does this cooperation serve? In part, the military alliance continues as a Cold War relic; Pakistan once served as a bulwark against Soviet expansionist policies in South Asia. For instance, during the Soviet Union’s occupation of Afghanistan (1980-1988), Pakistan served as a staging and training area for anti-Soviet fighters from all over the world. Despite the implosion of the Soviet Union, this military-to-military relationship endures. It is not, however, in the U.S.’s interest for Pakistan to dissolve as a nation-state no longer sovereign in its territorial space. This would invite Islamic terrorists throughout the world to flock to a newly failed and ungoverned region, jam-packed with nuclear weapons. Nor would such a scenario be in the interest of India, which could become the principal target of a collapsed Pakistan. The collapse of nuclear Pakistan would require action by outside powers, probably including the U.S., to interdict any possible efforts by terrorist groups to seize its nuclear weapons. Finally, as long as the United States and its allies have troops deployed to Afghanistan, it is prudent to paper over existing tensions. Pakistan and Afghanistan share an approximately 2500-kilometer border, etched with mountainous topography and remote passes that can facilitate terrorist infiltration. Without Pakistan’s present limited cooperation, however, American troop casualties in Afghanistan could rise sharply. Pakistan might entirely end its already less-than-ideal assistance to the war effort in Afghanistan. Several policy initiatives might motivate Pakistan to cooperate more fully in the U.S.-led war on Islamic terrorism. The U.S. could cease all military aid for an extended period. The U.S. could direct the Department of State to place Pakistan on the list of state sponsors of terrorism. The U.S. could use its influence with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to deny Pakistan loans. The U.S. could cut off all economic assistance. The U.S. could declassify intelligence reports revealing Pakistan’s ties to terrorist groups. Such moves would certainly inconvenience the Pakistani leadership. Finally, the U.S. could threaten to support internal separatist movements, such as the ethnic Baloch desire for independence in Pakistan’s western province of Balochistan. It is long past time for the U.S. to choose what type of relationship it wants.

Finally, as long as the United States and its allies have troops deployed to Afghanistan, it is prudent to paper over existing tensions. Pakistan and Afghanistan share an approximately 2500-kilometer border, etched with mountainous topography and remote passes that can facilitate terrorist infiltration. Without Pakistan’s present limited cooperation, however, American troop casualties in Afghanistan could rise sharply. Pakistan might entirely end its already less-than-ideal assistance to the war effort in Afghanistan. Several policy initiatives might motivate Pakistan to cooperate more fully in the U.S.-led war on Islamic terrorism. The U.S. could cease all military aid for an extended period. The U.S. could direct the Department of State to place Pakistan on the list of state sponsors of terrorism. The U.S. could use its influence with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to deny Pakistan loans. The U.S. could cut off all economic assistance. The U.S. could declassify intelligence reports revealing Pakistan’s ties to terrorist groups. Such moves would certainly inconvenience the Pakistani leadership. Finally, the U.S. could threaten to support internal separatist movements, such as the ethnic Baloch desire for independence in Pakistan’s western province of Balochistan. It is long past time for the U.S. to choose what type of relationship it wants.

News article:
As president, Donald Trump has steered a new course in the Middle East Donald Trump has spent much of his first year as president of the United States seeking to undo the legacy of his predecessor, Barack Obama. The volatile Middle East is one of the many areas where Trump has broken with US policy and precedent. On Wednesday, Trump overturned decades of US policy by announcing that Washington recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and setting in motion plans to move the embassy there from Tel Aviv. Here is a look at some of the hot button issues in the Middle East and the new course being steered by Trump: - Israel and the Palestinians - Trump has instituted a policy of unwavering support for Israel after a period of strained relations between Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The last days of the Obama administration included an extraordinary US refusal at the United Nations to block a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlement construction. Netanyahu welcomed Trump's November 2016 election saying he was a "true friend of the State of Israel." Since then, Trump has appointed a US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, known for his support for settlement activity, and ordered the withdrawal of US support for UNESCO, citing anti-Israel bias. Trump has tasked his son-in-law Jared Kushner, a senior adviser, with relaunching moribund peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. But he has been lukewarm about a Palestinian state and angered Palestinian leaders earlier this year with a threat -- since withdrawn -- to close the Palestine Liberation Organization mission in Washington. - Iran - Trump considers Iran to be the principal threat to US interests in the Middle East and has frequently condemned the Islamic Republic for what he sees as its "destabilizing" influence in Yemen, Syria and Lebanon. Trump has been a relentless critic of the Iran nuclear deal signed in 2015 and has repeatedly threatened to scrap the agreement intended to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. The president's tough stance on Iran has earned praise from Netanyahu and from Saudi Arabia, the Islamic Republic's chief regional rival. - Saudi Arabia, Egypt - Trump has strengthened ties with Saudi Arabia and his first official visit abroad as president was to the oil-rich monarchy, where he was received with pomp and circumstance. Trump threw his support behind the anti-corruption crackdown launched by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Saudi actions against Qatar, which Riyadh accuses of cooperating with Tehran. Relations with another Middle East powerhouse -- Egypt -- have also entered a new era under Trump. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was persona non grata under Obama and the United States cut off some military aid because of the bloody crackdown on supporters of the former president. But Trump welcomed Sisi to the White House in April and proclaimed his "strong backing" for the Egyptian leader. - Syria - Trump frequently accused Obama of failing to stand up to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and in April he ordered the first US military strike on Syrian troops since the civil war began in that country. Dozens of US missiles were fired at a Syrian air base in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack on a rebel town which left 87 people dead. The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria and the Pentagon said Tuesday that they will stay "as long as we need" to prevent a return of the Islamic State group. Trump also reinforced the US military contingent in Afghanistan, a move at odds with Obama's efforts to withdraw US troops from conflict zones abroad.

News article:
Criticism from the international community of U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital continue, warning that it threatens stability throughout the region. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that he is "launching an appeal for calm and responsibility." Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said the move runs counter to common sense. Moscow expects the U.S. to clarify its controversial decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital before the U.N. Security Council, Lavrov said. "Today, in my opinion, the [U.N.] Security Council will meet on this topic. We hope that there our American counterparts will explain how and where they see future steps" in the wake of the decision, Sergey Lavrov was quoted as saying by Russia's official TASS news agency. Lavrov's remarks came during a news conference at the OSCE foreign ministers meeting in the Austrian capital of Vienna. He mentioned that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told him on Thursday that the U.S. wants to conclude a "deal of the century" to solve the Palestinian-Israeli problem "in one stroke." The European Union's foreign policy chief on Friday sounded the alarm on the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, warning of its "very worrying potential impact." At a joint news conference with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman al-Safadi, Federica Mogherini said: "We were in close contact as always, but particularly in these last days during and after the announcement by Mr. Trump on the U.S. decision [on] Jerusalem. "We both agree that it is a decision that has a very worrying potential impact in this very fragile context. "No one can afford any further destabilization, and especially those living in the region. ... More violence and chaos are absolutely to be avoided. They are in no one's interest." Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri also said the U.S. decision "will further complicate the peace process and pose an additional challenge to the stability of the whole region." Hariri's brief resignation last month sparked fears of a new proxy conflict in Lebanon. Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Friday called on Muslim countries to unite and reject Trump's move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Latin American and Caribbean countries also voiced strong opposition Thursday. Eight out of 15 countries on the U.N. Security Council, including Bolivia and Uruguay, called for an urgent meeting of the council to discuss the issue. The government of Uruguay stressed that the White House's decision, "does not help to improve the climate of peace and mutual respect needed to reach a complete, lasting and fair solution in the Middle East." Bolivian ambassador to the U.N. Sacha Llorenti said the "unilateral decision violates various [U.N.] Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, undermines any attempts to reach a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and makes the already volatile region even more unstable." Mexico, through its Foreign Affairs secretary, said it will maintain its embassy in Tel Aviv. "Mexico will maintain its friendly bilateral relations with the state of Israel … and it will also support the historic claims of the Palestinian people," Mexico's foreign minister said. Venezuela, Ecuador, Argentina, Chile and Cuba are also among the Latin American countries that oppose the decision. Tanzania on Friday said its embassy in Israel will also remain in Tel Aviv, despite concerted efforts to convince the East African country to move its embassy to Jerusalem. Meanwhile, protests against the decision around the world continue. Thousands of people in the U.S. city of Chicago marched and protested through downtown on Thursday night, voicing their opposition to Trump's decision. Hundreds of Muslims protested in Indian-controlled Kashmir against Trump's decision concerning Jerusalem. Protesters marched in several places in the main city of Srinagar and other parts of the region after Friday prayers. They chanted slogans such as "Down with America" and "Down with Israel." Similar protests also took place in Jordan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Tunisia. Jordanians chanted "Jerusalem is Arab," as part of a protest against Trump's decision. Hundreds of Iranians also rallied in the capital, Tehran, and chanted "Death to America" and "Death to Israel" in a show of anger over the decision. More than 2,000 people staged a demonstration after Friday prayers outside Al-Azhar Mosque in eastern Cairo to protest U.S. President Donald Trump's decision.

Talking to IRNA on Saturday, Abhimanyu Kohar, who is the founder of a group called Yuva Kranti Organization which advocates new paradigms for Indian youth in political and social arenas said that the Zionist lobby in the United States has grown more powerful.Noting that earlier governments in the United States too had sought to transfer the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, he said now it is Trump who acts courageously to expose the dual American standard to the whole world.He said that the Zionist regime lobby in the United States has also tried to cancel the nuclear deal with Iran. And all these happen because the Zionist regime fears Hezbollah, Iran, and the Palestinian people.He added that “one of America's objectives in moving its embassy to Jerusalem is to provoke Muslims. The ISIS terrorist group has now been destroyed by the efforts of the Iraqi and Syrian armies and the Iranian aid. But the United States wants to expand extremist Wahhabi ideas in the region thus provokes Muslims to react.”On the consequences of the US decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem, the Indian political activist stressed that one results of this US decision is the elimination of talks with Palestine. While the US backed Zionist politicians claim they want to negotiate, but such actions will undermine the negotiation process.“If the United States really is a democratic country, they should respect the sentiments of the Palestinian people. The Palestinian issue is not a religious issue, but a humanistic problem. Human rights in Palestine have been ignored,” he stressed.He further noted, “People around the world support Palestine in a peaceful manner. But the Zionist regime is using violence against oppressed Palestinians. The people of the world should give the message to the United States that they support the Palestinians and press the United States and Zionist regime to comply with UN resolutions.”On Indian government and Indian media positions against Palestine, Kohar said, 'The Indian government has said that its policy will not be affected by the third country. The Indian foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj in the last Non-Alignment meeting has said that India is concerned about the situation in Palestine.However, he noted that in recent years, the Zionist regime-Wahhabi lobby has infiltrated India's media, so many of Indian media would refrain from explicitly voicing support to Palestine. The Indian government should continue to support the Palestinian people.Kohar concluded, 'The Palestinians must attain their rights, and all the countries must support the Palestinian people.'Ignoring the United Nations Security Council Resolution No. 478 dated 1980, Trump on Wednesday said in a press conference that the fact that Tel Aviv was currently used as the Zionist regime capital was 'illegal' and said, 'Time is ripe to recognize Quds as Israel capital.'He also ordered the US foreign ministry to make necessary preparations to relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to al-Quds.His decision was met by wide protest on the part of both governments and people of many world countries, even US allies.267**1424Follow us on Tweeter@ IrnaEnglish

The ISIS terrorist group has now been destroyed by the efforts of the Iraqi and Syrian armies and the Iranian aid. But the United States wants to expand extremist Wahhabi ideas in the region thus provokes Muslims to react.”On the consequences of the US decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem, the Indian political activist stressed that one results of this US decision is the elimination of talks with Palestine. While the US backed Zionist politicians claim they want to negotiate, but such actions will undermine the negotiation process.“If the United States really is a democratic country, they should respect the sentiments of the Palestinian people. The Palestinian issue is not a religious issue, but a humanistic problem. Human rights in Palestine have been ignored,” he stressed.He further noted, “People around the world support Palestine in a peaceful manner. But the Zionist regime is using violence against oppressed Palestinians. The people of the world should give the message to the United States that they support the Palestinians and press the United States and Zionist regime to comply with UN resolutions.”On Indian government and Indian media positions against Palestine, Kohar said, 'The Indian government has said that its policy will not be affected by the third country. The Indian foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj in the last Non-Alignment meeting has said that India is concerned about the situation in Palestine.However, he noted that in recent years, the Zionist regime-Wahhabi lobby has infiltrated India's media, so many of Indian media would refrain from explicitly voicing support to Palestine. The Indian government should continue to support the Palestinian people.Kohar concluded, 'The Palestinians must attain their rights, and all the countries must support the Palestinian people.'Ignoring the United Nations Security Council Resolution No. 478 dated 1980, Trump on Wednesday said in a press conference that the fact that Tel Aviv was currently used as the Zionist regime capital was 'illegal' and said, 'Time is ripe to recognize Quds as Israel capital.'He also ordered the US foreign ministry to make necessary preparations to relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to al-Quds.His decision was met by wide protest on the part of both governments and people of many world countries, even US allies.267**1424Follow us on Tweeter@ IrnaEnglish

News article:
By Khalaf Ahmad Al-Habtoor* By Khalaf Ahmad Al-Habtoor* Through its own actions, the US has diminished its status as leader of the free world and eliminated itself as an honest broker. America’s allies and adversaries are appalled by the recent decision to throw a grenade into the Middle East by unilaterally declaring Jerusalem the capital of the Jewish state. The special relationship between the UK and America is in jeopardy. Furious parliamentarians are calling for the US President Donald Trump to be banned from visiting Britain. In an unprecedented move, the UK, France and Italy joined with five other countries to demand an emergency session of the UN Security Council to air their condemnations. However, there will be no UN resolution due to America’s power of veto. Germany’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Sigmar Gabriel dispensed with diplomatic norms, saying: “The US no longer sees the world as a global community, but as a fighting arena where everyone has to seek their own advantage. Even after Trump leaves the White House, relations with the US will never be the same.” This reckless act has killed all hopes of peace. The motivation behind this decision was either to pacify the right-wing pro-Israel base in the US or to provoke violent reactions within our region to justify US anti-Muslim policies. Hamas has called for a third Palestinian uprising. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has refused to meet with Vice President Mike Pence, who will shortly be dispatched to the region to undertake damage control. Worse, this declaration has fed into the narrative of extremist groups. Al-Qaeda, Al-Shabab, the Taliban and others have made calls to arms. It has made the world a far more dangerous place for Israeli and American travelers by putting targets on their heads. This gross provocation is a gift to terrorist recruiters and could spark lone wolf attacks in Western and Arab cities. Trump is aware of the potential repercussions, which is why he has ordered US Marines to guard embassies and the US Department of State has advised Americans in the Middle East to keep a low profile. Disappointed in former US President Barack Obama’s pro-Iran stance and his affiliation with the terrorist Muslim Brotherhood, I had high hopes that a businessman could invigorate America’s economy and bring a fresh perspective to US Middle East policy. Unlike the US media that savaged Trump from the get-go, and still goes for his jugular, I nevertheless chose to give the new US administration a chance, primarily because the US is up there with the countries I most admire and many of my dearest friends are American. I wanted Trump to succeed for the sake of the American people and hoped he would strengthen the relationship between the US and the Arab world. It soon became evident that he had surrounded himself with disreputable characters, not least his short-lived chief strategist, the Machiavellian bully Steve Bannon, known for his incendiary anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant rhetoric. His even shorter-lived National Security Advisor Mike Flynn admitted lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about his conversations with the Russian ambassador and is now cooperating with Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s alleged meddling with the US election to save his own skin. In just over a year, 14 top-level officials within his administration have either been fired or have quit. At least nine Trump associates are being probed for collaboration with Moscow. The rogues’ gallery is expanding fast. True to his word, he binned liberal democratic free trade principles by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TTP) and threatening to cancel the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Almost the entire international community was shocked and dismayed by his ditching of the Paris climate accord and since, his executive orders have illustrated his disregard for maintaining a healthy environment and preserving wildlife. Within pro-western Arab nations, the strikes against him were mounting until his wildly successful visit to Saudi Arabia where he discussed ways of combating terrorism with King Salman and other Arab leaders in a warm celebratory atmosphere. Trump’s criticism of Qatar’s funding of terrorists and his support for the Saudi-led quartet’s political and economic distancing — contingent upon the emir’s acceptance of 13 demands — persuaded me that for all his faults we could count on him as a staunch ally. That was until his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson heaped praise on Qatar for its fight against terrorism while criticizing Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt for what he termed their “blockade.” From my own perspective, the US administration has three major strikes against it: Strike one: On Iran, it is yet to deliver the campaign pledge to pull America out of the woeful Iran deal, merely opting not to certify Tehran’s compliance. He is still to halt Iran’s aggressive actions toward its neighbors. Strike two: Following a US military assault to clear Raqqa of Daesh, Washington has seemingly handed Syria back to the Iranian-backed Bashar Assad regime and its Russian protector. Strike three: Washington has betrayed the Palestinian people, reneged on America’s commitments under the Oslo Accords and trampled upon UN Security Council Resolutions endorsed by his predecessors to the effect that only a final status agreement can determine Jerusalem’s status. In another mishap, Tillerson seems to have ignored that America has been a fully-fledged partner in the Saudi coalition’s efforts to beat back Iranian-supported Houthis to restore the legitimate government in Yemen. Now it appears the US State Department is “taking a tougher stance” against the efforts to reinstall a legitimate government in Yemen. That must be music to the ears of the Iranian mullahs and the primitive Houthi rag-tags, who slaughtered former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. I must, therefore, appeal to the leaders of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt and Jordan to adopt new policies to cope with these realities. We must be united to project power in order to protect our part of the world that has suffered so terribly from foreign interference and we should show our displeasure by collaborating with other world powers while diversifying our suppliers of aircraft, weapons, technological items etc. We Emiratis should work closely with our trusted friends to repair the damage done by the latest US Jerusalem announcement to ensure Jerusalem will always be the capital of Palestine in our hearts — and, if God wills, in reality. • Khalaf Ahmad Al Habtoor is a prominent UAE businessman and public figure.

News article:
President Donald Trump will on Monday declare a new US national security strategy for the next four years based on four pillars: protecting the homeland, stimulating American prosperity, promoting peace through strength, and enhancing American leadership in the world. National security adviser H.R. McMaster gave a preview of the Trump administration’s new national security policy, using interesting terminology to describe Russia and China as “revisionist powers”, and Iran and North Korea as “rogue regimes”. McMaster cited extremist jihadist groups as the third challenge facing the United States, but went beyond ISIS and al-Qaeda to include the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood in this category of threats, accusing Turkey and Qatar of endorsing, supporting, and promoting the Brotherhood. Moscow responded swiftly, questioning the knowledge of the national security adviser and denying any “sophisticated subversion” in the United States. This came amid continued bickering between Washington and Moscow, the Kremlin having recently responded to Washington’s questioning of Russian victory against ISIS in Syria and attempting to take credit for that victory itself, by saying 'victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan'. The American-Russian bickering in Syria is both superficial and deep, especially with regard to the fate of foreign forces in Syria – US troops, Russian forces, Iranian militias, and Turkish soldiers – as well as the fate of Bashar al-Assad himself. According to UN sources, the Syrian government is now working to kill off the Geneva Process, which has had the backing of the Security Council as a roadmap for a political settlement in Syria culminating with a transitional government with executive powers. Damascus’s bet is that the putative Sochi process would be the bullet that terminates Geneva. The Syrian government thus wanted the Geneva meeting to convene as a last stop without any further meetings, because in Sochi, under the auspices of its Russian ally, Damascus can possibly manipulate the transitional process away from the UN and Geneva path, complete with a new constitution, elections, and transitional mechanisms. Advertisement UN Syria envoy Staffan De Mistura is currently engaged in talks with the Russian authorities to agree on principles to link the Sochi process to Geneva’s. The UN hopes for a national dialogue to convene in Sochi on a basis that would enshrine a UN supervisory role in drafting the new constitution and holding elections, which should be the outcomes of this dialogue. But if De Mistura’s efforts to agree a clear framework for the Sochi process fail, Sochi will no doubt replace Geneva. This could spell the end for the idea of a transitional government with full executive powers, as promised by Security Council resolutions. Regarding the role of the Syrian former foreign minister Farouk al-Sharaa, amid reports he could lead the transitional process, a UN source revealed Syrian opposition figures had suggested to Russia that Sharaa lead the Sochi meeting, as a figure acceptable to both sides. The Russians reportedly were open to the idea, and have communicated this to Damascus. However, according to the same source, the Syrian government has not given a conclusive answer. If an agreement is reached on Sharaa heading the Sochi meeting, it is likely his role would be expanded to head a broad-based national government agreed by both sides. However, this does not mean that Bashar al-Assad would step down. That outcome was related to the Geneva process, but if Sharaa comes to head a transitional government through Sotchi, the terms are entirely different both practically and politically. The US administration seems less interested in the fate of Assad, his powers, and the transitional government than it is in the issue of permanent US military deployment in Syria. The US is determined to prevent Russia from monopolizing this strategic location to the exclusion of US interests. In equal measure, Washington is not concerned with the Syrian constitution and elections as much as it is concerned with the fate of Iran’s strategy in Syria and its corridor to Lebanon via Iraq and Syria. Advertisement US high-level military sources have mocked speculations suggesting Washington is going to turn a blind eye to Iran’s foothold in Syria and allow it to gain a strategic advantage there. Diplomatic sources say the US administration’s moves this week are crucial on the Iranian issue, ahead of President Trump’s announcement of his new national security strategy. Indeed, both McMaster and the US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley have moved to highlight their administration’s intention to confront Iran, especially in Syria, as McMaster said, and in Yemen, with Haley preparing a dossier on Iran’s actions there at the UN. A starting point for the US campaign against Iran in Yemen would be the UN Security Resolution that prohibits Iran from exporting weapons and missiles to the Houthi rebels. Haley has ‘evidence’ of Iranian support for the Houthis, and intends to present it to the Security Council after presenting it to the media and public opinion, to mobilize support for a firm US policy against Iran’s role in Yemen. In truth, this marks a shift in US policy, which previously steered clear from the issue of Yemen. It is also a shift from the policies of former President Obama, who avoided challenging Iran’s regional policies including its intervention in Yemen. This is an important shift, because it has a dimension related to US-Saudi relations under Trump, who resumed the strategic alliance with Riyadh after Obama’ downgraded those ties to a notch below his Iranian priority. It is also important because Obama had unburdened Iran from the Security Council resolutions that banned the export of weapons and fighters, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, under the nuclear deal with Iran. Today, the Trump administration is attempting to re-uphold the ban through Yemen, on the basis of a binding international resolutions with sanctions in the event of non-compliance. Haley is seeking to present evidence of Iranian violations and threats to the stability of US allies including by means of facilitating the launch of ballistic missiles against them, to pressure the European Union powers to stop abetting Iran’s actions in order to safeguard the nuclear deal. Indeed, the Trump administration intends to lobby the Europeans to impose sanctions on Iran, especially the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) for its deep incursions into Yemen, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. According to one US official source, however, it may be impossible to pass a resolution like that at the Security Council because of the Russian and Chinese vetoes. However, it is not impossible to take a firm stance with the Europeans on Iran’s destabilization of US allies. The doctrine Trump is expected to unveil on Monday will be based on confronting threats to US national security as a strategic commitment. Confronting Iran as a matter of policy, philosophy, and doctrine for the Trump administration upends Obama’s doctrine of appeasing Iran and its regional adventures. Advertisement The introduction of the Muslim Brotherhood to this doctrine is new, along with its inclusion in the list of Islamic radicalism and the accusations against Turkey of sponsoring the Brotherhood, and Qatar of promoting them. This in parallel with the expansion of the scope of what constitutes Islamic radicalism to include Iranian-backed Shia groups. The priority for the Trump doctrine will not be the ‘rogue regimes’ like Iran and North Korea, as much as it will be the ‘revisionist powers’ engaging in subversion in the domestic politics of Western states, undermining the international system, and waging economic aggression, like China and Russia, as designated by McMaster.

News article:
President Donald Trump will on Monday declare a new US national security strategy for the next four years based on four pillars: protecting the homeland, stimulating American prosperity, promoting peace through strength, and enhancing American leadership in the world. National security adviser H.R. McMaster gave a preview of the Trump administration’s new national security policy, using interesting terminology to describe Russia and China as “revisionist powers”, and Iran and North Korea as “rogue regimes”. McMaster cited extremist jihadist groups as the third challenge facing the United States, but went beyond ISIS and al-Qaeda to include the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood in this category of threats, accusing Turkey and Qatar of endorsing, supporting, and promoting the Brotherhood. Moscow responded swiftly, questioning the knowledge of the national security adviser and denying any “sophisticated subversion” in the United States. This came amid continued bickering between Washington and Moscow, the Kremlin having recently responded to Washington’s questioning of Russian victory against ISIS in Syria and attempting to take credit for that victory itself, by saying 'victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan'. The American-Russian bickering in Syria is both superficial and deep, especially with regard to the fate of foreign forces in Syria – US troops, Russian forces, Iranian militias, and Turkish soldiers – as well as the fate of Bashar al-Assad himself. According to UN sources, the Syrian government is now working to kill off the Geneva Process, which has had the backing of the Security Council as a roadmap for a political settlement in Syria culminating with a transitional government with executive powers. Damascus’s bet is that the putative Sochi process would be the bullet that terminates Geneva. The Syrian government thus wanted the Geneva meeting to convene as a last stop without any further meetings, because in Sochi, under the auspices of its Russian ally, Damascus can possibly manipulate the transitional process away from the UN and Geneva path, complete with a new constitution, elections, and transitional mechanisms. Advertisement UN Syria envoy Staffan De Mistura is currently engaged in talks with the Russian authorities to agree on principles to link the Sochi process to Geneva’s. The UN hopes for a national dialogue to convene in Sochi on a basis that would enshrine a UN supervisory role in drafting the new constitution and holding elections, which should be the outcomes of this dialogue. But if De Mistura’s efforts to agree a clear framework for the Sochi process fail, Sochi will no doubt replace Geneva. This could spell the end for the idea of a transitional government with full executive powers, as promised by Security Council resolutions. Regarding the role of the Syrian former foreign minister Farouk al-Sharaa, amid reports he could lead the transitional process, a UN source revealed Syrian opposition figures had suggested to Russia that Sharaa lead the Sochi meeting, as a figure acceptable to both sides. The Russians reportedly were open to the idea, and have communicated this to Damascus. However, according to the same source, the Syrian government has not given a conclusive answer. If an agreement is reached on Sharaa heading the Sochi meeting, it is likely his role would be expanded to head a broad-based national government agreed by both sides. However, this does not mean that Bashar al-Assad would step down. That outcome was related to the Geneva process, but if Sharaa comes to head a transitional government through Sotchi, the terms are entirely different both practically and politically. The US administration seems less interested in the fate of Assad, his powers, and the transitional government than it is in the issue of permanent US military deployment in Syria. The US is determined to prevent Russia from monopolizing this strategic location to the exclusion of US interests. In equal measure, Washington is not concerned with the Syrian constitution and elections as much as it is concerned with the fate of Iran’s strategy in Syria and its corridor to Lebanon via Iraq and Syria. Advertisement US high-level military sources have mocked speculations suggesting Washington is going to turn a blind eye to Iran’s foothold in Syria and allow it to gain a strategic advantage there. Diplomatic sources say the US administration’s moves this week are crucial on the Iranian issue, ahead of President Trump’s announcement of his new national security strategy. Indeed, both McMaster and the US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley have moved to highlight their administration’s intention to confront Iran, especially in Syria, as McMaster said, and in Yemen, with Haley preparing a dossier on Iran’s actions there at the UN. A starting point for the US campaign against Iran in Yemen would be the UN Security Resolution that prohibits Iran from exporting weapons and missiles to the Houthi rebels. Haley has ‘evidence’ of Iranian support for the Houthis, and intends to present it to the Security Council after presenting it to the media and public opinion, to mobilize support for a firm US policy against Iran’s role in Yemen. In truth, this marks a shift in US policy, which previously steered clear from the issue of Yemen. It is also a shift from the policies of former President Obama, who avoided challenging Iran’s regional policies including its intervention in Yemen. This is an important shift, because it has a dimension related to US-Saudi relations under Trump, who resumed the strategic alliance with Riyadh after Obama’ downgraded those ties to a notch below his Iranian priority. It is also important because Obama had unburdened Iran from the Security Council resolutions that banned the export of weapons and fighters, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, under the nuclear deal with Iran. Today, the Trump administration is attempting to re-uphold the ban through Yemen, on the basis of a binding international resolutions with sanctions in the event of non-compliance. Haley is seeking to present evidence of Iranian violations and threats to the stability of US allies including by means of facilitating the launch of ballistic missiles against them, to pressure the European Union powers to stop abetting Iran’s actions in order to safeguard the nuclear deal. Indeed, the Trump administration intends to lobby the Europeans to impose sanctions on Iran, especially the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) for its deep incursions into Yemen, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. According to one US official source, however, it may be impossible to pass a resolution like that at the Security Council because of the Russian and Chinese vetoes. However, it is not impossible to take a firm stance with the Europeans on Iran’s destabilization of US allies. The doctrine Trump is expected to unveil on Monday will be based on confronting threats to US national security as a strategic commitment. Confronting Iran as a matter of policy, philosophy, and doctrine for the Trump administration upends Obama’s doctrine of appeasing Iran and its regional adventures.

News article:
President Donald Trump has laid out plans for the U.S. to challenge Russia and China's growing influence on the world stage; rein in North Korea and Iran's defiance of the West; and destroy what's left of the Islamic State militant group (ISIS). Trump announced Monday his new national security strategy, a document produced by every U.S. leader since former President Ronald Reagan as mandated by Congress in 1986. Trump's highly anticipated report, which was shared by the White House, promised an "America First" strategy that identified other leading world powers, authoritarian states opposed to the West and the global threat of jihadi organizations as the foremost threats to the U.S. Related: U.S. War With Russia and China More Likely as World Power Shifts From West to East, NATO Says "China and Russia challenge American power, influence and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity. They are determined to make economies less free and less fair, to grow their militaries, and to control information and data to repress their societies and expand their influence," Trump wrote in his first such report as president. "At the same time, the dictatorships of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Islamic Republic of Iran are determined to destabilize regions, threaten Americans and our allies, and brutalize their own people. Transnational threat groups, from jihadist terrorists to transnational criminal organizations, are actively trying to harm Americans," he wrote. In the 55-page document, Trump did not specifically reference U.S. allegations that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election in his favor, but did charge Moscow with "using information tools in an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of democracies." When Trump entered office in January, he was widely considered to be a political ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, but their relationship has been strained as their nations diverged on major issues such as the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Ukraine. Recent reports that the CIA provided the Kremlin with crucial intelligence to stop a jihadi attack in St. Petersburg, and cautious cooperation between the U.S. and Russia in battling ISIS in Syria have produced prospects for an improved relationship, but the Trump administration has remained deeply suspicious of Russia's growing military power and diplomatic influence that challenges Western dominance in crucial areas such as Europe and the Middle East. Trump criticized Russian and Chinese initiatives to develop "advanced weapons and capabilities that could threaten our critical infrastructure and our command and control architecture" and "to reassert their influence regionally and globally." In addition to targeting China's own growing military and political power, Trump censured Beijing for stealing "U.S. intellectual property valued at hundreds of billions of dollars," while noting its advances in sophisticated artificial intelligence programs and investment in infrastructure across the globe. The report singled out the "rogue regime" of North Korea and "evil dictatorship" of Iran, both of which occupied the State Department's list of State Sponsors of Terrorism as of November. Trump escalated the U.S.-led campaign to disarm North Korea's nuclear and ballistic weapons arsenal, which has grown substantially in power under young supreme leader Kim Jong Un, and threatened to do so by force. Trump also decertified a 2015 historic nuclear deal with Iran and has led efforts to isolate Tehran diplomatically over accusations it sponsored militant groups across the Middle East. Trump pledged to deploy "a layered missile defense system focused on North Korea and Iran to defend our homeland against missile attacks." Both countries have denied wanting to target the U.S. and have compared Trump's stance toward their respective nations to that of former President George W. Bush in the days leading up to the Iraq War. Trump's charges against Russia and Iran came in spite of the fact that all three were involved in the fight against ISIS, which saw significant losses in the past year. In separate offensives, a Russia and Iran-backed campaign and a U.S.-led campaign largely defeated the militants in Syria, while forces supported by both the U.S. and Iran ousted the jihadis from the vast majority of Iraq. Russia, Iran, Iraq and Syria have all declared victory over the group in past weeks, but their forces, as well as the U.S., continue bombing the group in shrinking pockets of territory. Despite ISIS's massive territorial defeats, attacks conducted in the name of the group have continued worldwide. New York City experienced its first ISIS-inspired attack in October, the deadliest to hit the city since 9/11, and a second earlier this month, which injured several people, including the perpetrator. Authorities said the suspect in the pipe-bomb blast, which only seriously hurt the attacker himself, may have gotten instructions to build the device online, highlighting the continued threat of ISIS's virtual caliphate, which has provided instructions to would-be jihadis to strike targets around the world.

Authorities said the suspect in the pipe-bomb blast, which only seriously hurt the attacker himself, may have gotten instructions to build the device online, highlighting the continued threat of ISIS's virtual caliphate, which has provided instructions to would-be jihadis to strike targets around the world.

News article:
US President Donald Trump had harsh words for Iran on Tuesday, as he delivered a speech in Washington, DC unveiling his “America First” national security strategy. “To counter Iran and block its path to a nuclear weapon, I sanctioned the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) for its support of terrorism,” Trump said. “I declined to certify the Iran deal to Congress.” The president also said that “the Gulf states and other Muslim-majority nations” had “joined together to fight radical Islamic ideology and terrorist financing” following his trip to the Middle East earlier this year. Trump outlined the four pillars undergirding his strategy as the protection of the American homeland and its borders, promoting American economic prosperity, boosting spending on the US military and ending the defense budget sequester, and advancing American influence and values abroad. Related coverage DePaul University Student Government Denounces Campus Antisemitism The Student Government Association (SGA) of DePaul University issued a statement earlier this month denouncing antisemitism. "We as the DePaul Student... “Any nation that trades away its prosperity for security will end up losing both,” Trump said. One former senior official in the George W. Bush administration observed that Trump was far less sanguine than his predecessor on the question of alliances with other nations. “President Trump obviously sees a Hobbesian world with enormous challenges to the United States, and the Strategy sees countries like China, Iran, and Russia as rivals and opponents not partners,” Elliott Abrams — who served as deputy assistant to the president and deputy national security adviser in the George W. Bush administration — told The Algemeiner on Monday. “Accordingly it calls for an increase in American military strength,” Abrams said. “That is a welcome change from the Obama approach to world affairs.” On the Middle East, Trump’s National Security Strategy echoes some of the skepticism of the Bush administration regarding the centrality of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute to the myriad conflicts and human rights outrages across the region. In 2006, Bush’s National Security Strategy declared, “Terrorism is not simply a result of Israeli-Palestinian issues. Al-Qaeda plotting for the September 11 attacks began in the 1990s, during an active period in the peace process.” Trump’s strategy document goes even further, arguing, “For generations the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians has been understood as the prime irritant preventing peace and prosperity in the region. Today, the threats from jihadist terrorist organizations and the threat from Iran are creating the realization that Israel is not the cause of the region’s problems.” “States have increasingly found common interests with Israel in confronting common threats,” the National Security Strategy document highlighted. Overall, the strategy indicates that the Trump administration will work with national governments and regional bodies in the Middle East to counter Islamist terrorism and growing Iranian political and military influence. “Whenever possible, we will encourage gradual reforms,” the strategy said. “We will support efforts to counter violent ideologies and increase respect for the dignity of individuals. We remain committed to helping our partners achieve a stable and prosperous region, including through a strong and integrated Gulf Cooperation Council. We will strengthen our long-term strategic partnership with Iraq as an independent state. We will seek a settlement to the Syrian civil war that sets the conditions for refugees to return home and rebuild their lives in safe.” The document continued: “We will work with partners to deny the Iranian regime all paths to a nuclear weapon and neutralize Iranian malign influence. We remain committed to helping facilitate a comprehensive peace agreement that is acceptable to both Israelis and Palestinians.” The new national security strategy identifies Russia and China as threats to US prosperity, saying that both countries are “developing advanced weapons and capabilities that could threaten our critical infrastructure and our command and control architecture.” Nevertheless, in his speech, Trump presented the US and Russia as allies in the war againt Islamist terror groups. The president warmly mentioned a phone call he received from Russian leader Vladimir Putin thanking the US for supplying intelligence that thwarted a major terrorist outrage in the city of St. Petersburg. “That’s a great thing,” Trump stressed. “That’s the way it’s supposed to work.”

News article:
Alwaght– In an appearance with his British counterpart Mark Sedwill, the US National Security Advisor General H. R. McMaster on December 12 outlined the most important aspects of the new American national security doctrine. They came in four priorities: Protection of the homeland and American people, advancing the American prosperity, preserving peace through strength, and advancing the American influence. The American president is set to unveil the document of the new American national security strategy on December 18. The irrational functions of the American president both at home and in the country’s foreign policy have doubled significance of unveiling of the new national security strategy that will highlight the national interests as well as the threats and their sources and the ways to prevent and repulse them. According to the American national security advisor, Russia and China, and then North Korea and Iran will be marked the top threats to the US national security and Washington’s position of the global leadership. The General took a warning tone on Russia, saying: “We are facing a threat from Russia that involves also so-called new generation warfare.” He as part of the Russia-related comments touched on the American intelligence community’s assessment of Russian attempts to influence the American presidential elections last year, adding “These are very sophisticated campaigns of subversion and disinformation, and propaganda, using cyber tools operating across multiple domains that attempt to divide our communities within our nations.” General McMaster blasted China for what he called Beijing’s “economic aggression.” He said China has challenged the global law-based economic order, causing hundreds of millions of people around the world to live in poverty. The advisor, moreover, asked the Chinese officials to do more in relation to the North Korean nuclear crisis. He said that this call could mark the best and last opportunity to steer clear of military confrontation with Pyongyang. The American official also had his words on Iran, maintaining that the new American strategy will seek to counter the Islamic Republic in not only the embattled Syria but also the whole West Asia region. He added that this encounter will go while efforts to block Iran’s alleged efforts to build nuclear weapons will go on unceasingly. America First policy: Walking towards isolation One of the major mottos of Donald Trump during 2016 presidential campaign was “America First” policy. For the American president, there are no such things as “global anthem”, “global currency”, and “global flag.” Nevertheless, the American businessman believes that his “Job is not to represent the world,” emphasizing that “My job is to represent the United States of America”. When it comes to the comparison with his precedents, Trump’s strategy is way different. The national security of the former President Barack Obama, published in 2015, focused on such concepts as multilateralism, smart power, and the need to tackle the climate changes. Obama’s predecessor George W. Bush national security accentuated the American alleged commitment to opening up the closed societies and defending the democracy and human rights. But Trump’s key national security strategy lines isolate the US from such things as global security efforts, boosting peace, and promoting democracy in other countries. Instead, the core tenets of his strategy are the advancing prosperity, protecting the Americans, and expanding Washington’s influence worldwide. Here is the American strategy under Trump in short: The US stages irresponsible interventionism, in which the American prosperity should be saved instead of enlarged, and, foreign economic powers are considered rivals rather than partners. In this new strategic pathway, the US role-playing on the global stage will be devoted to the cases and regions where the country’s interests are directly involved. In the brand-new vision, the realization of interests will less be pursued through multi-polar international organizations, modalities, and regimes. Instead, the concentration will be on bipolar balance-making deals with each of the rival powers, similar to the 19th century fragile and flowing accords between the powers on specific cases. Therefore, under the new leadership, the US seeks preserving the past achievements rather than creating opportunities for more partnership with the others. This is drawing opposition from allies. Europe as the closest ally of the US comes against Washington’s unilateral decisions like withdrawing from Paris climate agreement, challenging the Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran, and very recently the controversial recognition of al-Quds (Jerusalem) as the Israeli regime’s capital. Such conflict of views with the allied EU will certainly bring isolation to the US. Therefore, Trump himself is setting up major roadblocks ahead of the global American influence. Confrontational policy to save the current position The revision of the national security strategy in less than three years accentuates the White House leader’s growing concerns over the wavering position of the US as a global superpower which was gained after the breakup of the rival Soviet Union whose existence ensured a bipolar global order. In the recent years, concomitant with the decline of the US role and effect on various intentional cases was the rise of such new powers as Russia, China, and the European Union, three of which proving to be challengers, though in various degrees, to the American might. Among the other two, China, with its extraordinary economic growth and military strength boost, presented most challenging force to the US hegemony on the world arena. McMaster also said that in recent years the US cleared the rivalry scene and so gave opportunities to what he called “revisionist powers”, in a reference to China and Russia. His reference was apparently to the Obama’s policies, including pulling out of Iraq and partially from Afghanistan and failing to meet expectations of the regional allies for Washington’s direct role in crises such as Syria and Ukraine that flattened the way of the Russian influence boost in West Asia and Eastern Europe. Other US fallacious policies, according to McMaster, involved failing to seriously check Beijing’s rapid economic upturn and geopolitical expansionism in East Asia and posing threats to US allies in the region. In McMaster’s eye, signing the nuclear agreement with Iran and neglecting the Israeli and Saudi calls for adequately pressing Tehran under Obama was another flaw of the previous administration.

His reference was apparently to the Obama’s policies, including pulling out of Iraq and partially from Afghanistan and failing to meet expectations of the regional allies for Washington’s direct role in crises such as Syria and Ukraine that flattened the way of the Russian influence boost in West Asia and Eastern Europe. Other US fallacious policies, according to McMaster, involved failing to seriously check Beijing’s rapid economic upturn and geopolitical expansionism in East Asia and posing threats to US allies in the region. In McMaster’s eye, signing the nuclear agreement with Iran and neglecting the Israeli and Saudi calls for adequately pressing Tehran under Obama was another flaw of the previous administration.

News article:
Topic: Presidency Strategy Region: United States Blog Brand: Paul Pillar The congressionally mandated national security strategies have for the most part not merited the term “strategy”. They are public documents meant for public consumption rather than as guides to decision-making about individual foreign policy problems. They are essentially an additional opportunity, along with presidential speeches and other vehicles, for expressing to the public an administration’s favored themes. This observation applies at least as much to Donald Trump's newly released national security strategy as to those of other administrations. Although some of Trump’s senior subordinates are quite capable of thinking strategically, the president himself has given scant indication of having a strategic bone in his body when in comes to national security. Trump’s utterances on the subject have shown evidence less of any deep thinking than of inconsistency, ignorance stemming from inexperience, and a demagogue’s concern with applause lines. Moreover, a document published under the name of a president who has taken lying to a level far beyond that of most other politicians is, unsurprisingly, duplicitous as well. The duplicity extends not just to individual mischaracterizations but to absconding of entire concepts—or more precisely, to the use of terms that refer to such concepts without making policy that conforms with them. The administration’s document claims to be a “strategy of principled realism,” while the Trump foreign policy has not been realist at all, especially given its tendency to divide the world rigidly into friends and foes. The document also favorably refers to the realist concept of “balance of power,” but Trump’s foreign policy has been far different from one that would observe the principles and reap the benefits of a balance of power. The administration’s document brazenly claims to be pursuing objectives that it instead is trashing. It says that “diplomacy is indispensable to identify and implement solutions” and that “we must upgrade our diplomatic capabilities” at the same time that it is running the State Department into the ground and, on issue after issue, blowing off the department’s diplomatic mission. The document declares that “the national debt, now over $20 trillion, presents a grave threat to America’s long-term prosperity and, by extension, our national security” as the president is about to sign, with celebration and no reluctance, one of the biggest deficit-ballooning pieces of legislation in recent history. The over-arching theme of the strategy document is the now-familiar slogan of “America first”. An outward-looking sub-theme involves American leadership abroad. White House economic adviser Gary Cohn and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, in a much-noticed op ed earlier this year, explained that “America First does not mean America alone.” But in its first eleven months, the Trump administration has descended more quickly into self-generated isolation than has any other U.S. administration in memory. Much of this descent stems from Trump’s insistence on doing the opposite of whatever his predecessor did. The United States is the sole country on the planet that disavows the Paris climate change agreement aimed at saving the planet—now that the last two other previous holdouts, the Assad regime in Syria and the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua, have signed on. Trump’s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership has left the other participants to proceed without the United States, as well as giving new opportunities for regional influence to China. Trump’s efforts to undermine the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a.k.a. the Iran nuclear agreement, which seven countries negotiated, have left the United States, not Iran, as the isolated party. And just this week, Nikki Haley cast the first U.S. veto in six years at the United Nations Security Council, against an otherwise unanimously supported resolution opposing the Trump administration’s declaration about Jerusalem. The Jerusalem move illustrates another of the Trump administration’s proclivities that run directly against the idea of “America first”. This tendency is the subcontracting of policy to certain favored foreign regimes, rather than independently pursuing U.S. interests. Bowing to the preferences of the right-wing government of Israel is the most glaring example, with the decision on Jerusalem going farther in this direction than even previous U.S. administrations had gone. Not as far-reaching but just as obvious over the past year has been the bowing to preferences of the Saudi regime regarding rivalries and tensions in the Persian Gulf. The strategy document, and much of Trump’s other rhetoric, suggest that “America first” also implies a need to attend to the strength of America at home, and so it should. But again the chasm between rhetoric and policy is gaping. The illustrations of this are numerous, but consider just some of what has been in the news the past several days. The Republican tax bill heads the list. It (along with ostensibly deficit-hawkish resistance to Barack Obama’s stimulus program when the United States was still struggling out of the Great Recession) stands sound fiscal policy on its head. It rewards owners and inheritors over workers and strivers. The heavy blow it delivers to the public finances will make more difficult, politically as well as economically, many ways of strengthening America to better enable it to advance its interests in a turbulent world, from improving the health of its citizens to rebuilding decrepit infrastructure. Donald Trump talked a good game about infrastructure, but he has done little or nothing to make good on the talk and in the post-tax bill world is even less likely to make good on it. One infrastructural deficiency—the unwillingness to pay for the installation of proven technology that prevents speeding by trains—allowed this week's fatal train crash in Washington state. At least as important in defining a strong America as a competitor on the world stage is the strength and integrity of American democracy. Here, too, the recent trend has not been good. In addition to voter suppression laws and gerrymandering, the biggest additional issue since Trump’s rise has been Russian interference in U.S. elections. Rather than leading, as any U.S. president should, a principled effort to uphold the integrity of representative democracy in the United States, Trump has tried to deny the whole problem. With his kind of leadership, members of his party are trying to discredit and derail the one investigation with the best chance of getting to the bottom of it all. Honest and open discourse and debate are essential to the healthy functioning of any democracy. Trump’s constant dismissal of inconvenient truths and his raising of lies to the same level as any truth have been corrupting that discourse and debate all year long. Here the relevant development of the past few days is another turn in the administration’s Orwellian attempts at thought control by banishing certain terms or concepts from any part of the discourse it can censor. Its previous efforts expunged discussion of climate change—the most blatant big omission from the national security strategy document. The latest censorship was the attempt to impose on the Centers for Disease Control a list of banned terms such as “evidence-based”. As an example for the world, the America of Donald Trump is becoming less the shining city on a hill of Ronald Reagan’s (and John Winthrop’s) America and more an embarrassment. Don’t expect to find real strategy in the latest national security strategy. Do grieve at the discrepancy between favorable-sounding words in that document and the reality being wrought by the man whose name appears on it.

News article:
Donald Trump, who had no experience in politics, became the president of the United States with his famous motto "America first." While Trump and his aides try to "make America great again," unconsciously, they have sped up the decline of American hegemony due to their unilateral foreign policy understanding and exclusionary political discourse. The U.S. now is notorious not only in the eyes of its challengers, but also in the eyes of its long-time allies and friends. Trump's America has begun to alienate almost all its partners, from the narrowest circle to the widest one, from Anglo-Saxon friends to European partners, from Latin American neighbors to Asian rivals, from Sub-Sahara to North Africa. Trump's America contradicts its closest ally, the United Kingdom. The latest two cases, in which the Trump administration contradicted the May government, are Trump's proclamation on Jerusalem and retweeting inflammatory videos shared by a British ultra-nationalist politician. Similar to almost all European countries, the U.K. government also rejected Trump's decision on Jerusalem. In her official statement, British Prime Minister Theresa May pointed out that her government disagrees with Trump's decision. Similarly, all sides of the House of Commons condemned the decision. Moreover, Prime Minister May denounced President Trump for sharing abusive and threatening videos posted by Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, a far-right political party in the U.K. Trump, who is against the global free trade order established by Pax Americana, declared the end of the era of multinational trade agreements. As soon as he came to power, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TTP). As a result, the 11 Pacific Rim countries, which had total trade of $350 billion last year, decided to resurrect the partnership and start free trade. Trump's America initiated a comprehensive trade war with European countries. Trump promised to scrap the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Nevertheless, he claimed that it would limit imports of steel and aluminum to protect domestic companies. The European Union will retaliate against any sanctions imposed by the U.S. against European companies. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had to declare that the EU's mood "is increasingly combative" on the topic of international trade. Furthermore, 25 EU member states signed a defense cooperation agreement and decided to establish Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), which will decrease their dependence on NATO, and as a result their dependence on the U.S. Latin American countries, which are considered as the "near abroad" of the U.S. since the early years of the 19th century, consistently complain about threats from the U.S. Similarly, most Asian countries have many political and economic divergences with Trump's America. Trump even attempted to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump's America otherizes Islamic civilization and Muslims worldwide, including American and European Muslims, who are citizens of Western countries. Trump's anti-Islamic and anti-immigration rhetoric damages American global perception. In particular, after the Jerusalem decision, it would not be surprising if anti-Americanism skyrockets in Muslim countries. Although it will satisfy the Israeli government and his constituency, the unpopularity of Trump's America is growing in the Muslim world. Two developments last Monday punctuated America's increasing isolation. The first was the vote on a resolution demanding the rejection of Trump's decision on Jerusalem. All 14 members of the 15-member U.N. Security Council, including the staunchest U.S. allies such as the U.K., voted for the resolution. The U.S. was alone. The second was the announcement of the new national security strategy. Trump declared global powers such as Russia and China, middle states such as Iran and North Korea and non-state actors as multiple threats challenging U.S. interests. While the strategy aims to fight these multiple challenges, it rejects multiple cooperation initiatives such as multiple free trade agreements. As a result, due to its unilateral and irresponsible foreign policy behavior and conflictual political discourse, Trump's America instigated the rise of anti-Americanism even in friendly countries such as the U.K., Germany, Mexico and Turkey. Most observers from both the U.S. and other Western circles claim that Trump's strategy is not sustainable and that it will turn out to be self-destructive. Soon to be a lone hegemon, Trump's America is seen as an unreliable partner by most of its partners and allies. Trump's unpredictable and domestically driven foreign policy discourse confuses not only foreign governments but also most of the American public.

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 aligned.

The image shows a man waving an Israeli flag and an American flag. The man is standing in front of a building with a sign that says "Subway." The image is taken from a low angle, which makes the man look powerful and imposing. The American flag is on the right side of the image, which is the side that is typically associated with good and right. The Israeli flag is on the left side of the image, which is the side that is typically associated with evil and wrong. The man's facial expression is hidden, which makes him look mysterious and threatening. The image is set in a dark and shadowy environment, which adds to the sense of danger and foreboding.

The news events set is about the Trump administration's foreign policy. Trump has been accused of alienating America's allies and partners, and of making the world a more dangerous place. The image of the man waving the Israeli flag and the American flag can be seen as a symbol of Trump's foreign policy. Trump has been a strong supporter of Israel, and he has also been critical of the Palestinians. The image can be seen as a warning that Trump's foreign policy is leading to a more dangerous world.

Moreover, Prime Minister May denounced President Trump for sharing abusive and threatening videos posted by Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, a far-right political party in the U.K. Trump, who is against the global free trade order established by Pax Americana, declared the end of the era of multinational trade agreements. As soon as he came to power, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TTP). As a result, the 11 Pacific Rim countries, which had total trade of $350 billion last year, decided to resurrect the partnership and start free trade. Trump's America initiated a comprehensive trade war with European countries. Trump promised to scrap the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Nevertheless, he claimed that it would limit imports of steel and aluminum to protect domestic companies. The European Union will retaliate against any sanctions imposed by the U.S. against European companies. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had to declare that the EU's mood "is increasingly combative" on the topic of international trade. Furthermore, 25 EU member states signed a defense cooperation agreement and decided to establish Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), which will decrease their dependence on NATO, and as a result their dependence on the U.S. Latin American countries, which are considered as the "near abroad" of the U.S. since the early years of the 19th century, consistently complain about threats from the U.S. Similarly, most Asian countries have many political and economic divergences with Trump's America. Trump even attempted to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump's America otherizes Islamic civilization and Muslims worldwide, including American and European Muslims, who are citizens of Western countries. Trump's anti-Islamic and anti-immigration rhetoric damages American global perception. In particular, after the Jerusalem decision, it would not be surprising if anti-Americanism skyrockets in Muslim countries. Although it will satisfy the Israeli government and his constituency, the unpopularity of Trump's America is growing in the Muslim world. Two developments last Monday punctuated America's increasing isolation. The first was the vote on a resolution demanding the rejection of Trump's decision on Jerusalem. All 14 members of the 15-member U.N. Security Council, including the staunchest U.S. allies such as the U.K., voted for the resolution. The U.S. was alone. The second was the announcement of the new national security strategy. Trump declared global powers such as Russia and China, middle states such as Iran and North Korea and non-state actors as multiple threats challenging U.S. interests. While the strategy aims to fight these multiple challenges, it rejects multiple cooperation initiatives such as multiple free trade agreements. As a result, due to its unilateral and irresponsible foreign policy behavior and conflictual political discourse, Trump's America instigated the rise of anti-Americanism even in friendly countries such as the U.K., Germany, Mexico and Turkey. Most observers from both the U.S. and other Western circles claim that Trump's strategy is not sustainable and that it will turn out to be self-destructive. Soon to be a lone hegemon, Trump's America is seen as an unreliable partner by most of its partners and allies. Trump's unpredictable and domestically driven foreign policy discourse confuses not only foreign governments but also most of the American public.

The image shows U.S. Vice President Mike Pence speaking at the Israeli-American Council National Summit in Hollywood, Florida. The summit was attended by many pro-Israel American politicians, including President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump. The event was seen as a show of support for Israel by the Trump administration.

The news events set is about the Trump administration's foreign policy, which has been characterized by unilateralism, protectionism, and isolationism. The Trump administration has withdrawn the U.S. from several international agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris Agreement on climate change. It has also imposed tariffs on goods imported from China and other countries. The Trump administration has also been critical of NATO and other international organizations.

The image shows the Trump administration's support for Israel, while the news events set describes the Trump administration's policies towards other countries. The image and the news events set together provide a comprehensive view of the Trump administration's foreign policy.


News article:
Donald Trump, who had no experience in politics, became the president of the United States with his famous motto "America first." While Trump and his aides try to "make America great again," unconsciously, they have sped up the decline of American hegemony due to their unilateral foreign policy understanding and exclusionary political discourse. The U.S. now is notorious not only in the eyes of its challengers, but also in the eyes of its long-time allies and friends. Trump's America has begun to alienate almost all its partners, from the narrowest circle to the widest one, from Anglo-Saxon friends to European partners, from Latin American neighbors to Asian rivals, from Sub-Sahara to North Africa. Trump's America contradicts its closest ally, the United Kingdom. The latest two cases, in which the Trump administration contradicted the May government, are Trump's proclamation on Jerusalem and retweeting inflammatory videos shared by a British ultra-nationalist politician. Similar to almost all European countries, the U.K. government also rejected Trump's decision on Jerusalem. In her official statement, British Prime Minister Theresa May pointed out that her government disagrees with Trump's decision. Similarly, all sides of the House of Commons condemned the decision.

News article:
Ever encounter a panhandler, and, motivated by kindness, hand over a dollar? Only to have the beggar berate you for not giving more? That’s the situation the United States finds itself in with the United Nations. President Trump’s not-so-subtle threat to remember which nations voted to condemn his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital was the ultimate case of speaking truth to power. The largest – by far – donor to the United Nations, and a provider of foreign aid to dozens of other U.N. member states, America holds a unique, though decidedly not privileged position in the so-called world body. Yet for decades, it has been stymied by its rivals (China and Russia), by rogue regimes (Iran), and by a U.N. leadership that views America as a source of demonic, not democratic values. Like a spoiled child who complains its allowance has not be paid on time, recipients of U.S. aid forget that those dollars are largesse, not earned income. Well and good. But why, then, should the U.S. continue to ante up 22 percent of the U.N.’s budget, and fully 28 percent of its peacekeeping effort? When Ambassador Nikki Haley said the U.S. would be “taking names,” and Trump said “we’ll be watching,” liberal news outlets reacted as if a Mafia chieftain had just set the price for a kidnapping victim’s release. Why the moral outrage? We know our friends. Guatemala, Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo joined the U.S. voting against the resolution of condemnation. Another 35 countries, including our closest neighbors, Mexico and Canada, as well as Argentina, Australia, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Romania, abstained. And now we know who cannot depend on. Egypt, to whom we provide $1.6 billion in aid each year, voted against the U.S. Turkey, which gets $155 million, went against us, with its president Recep Tayyip Erdogan boldly declaring, “What is the cradle of democracy doing? They are looking for people they can buy with their dollars.” Fine, Mr. President, fine. Like a spoiled child who complains its allowance has not been paid on time, recipients of U.S. aid forget that those dollars are largesse, not earned income. News outlets like Sky News in the United Kingdom – which voted to condemn Trump’s move – had on-air apoplexy about the president’s statement. Of course, the U.N. is a toothless, almost furless tiger. Its resolutions of outrage and disapproval count for precisely nothing. Trump is not the first president to speak aloud about the ingratitude of the U.N. He may, however, be the first to do something about it.

News article:
The torment of waking up to a Trump presidency has been described by some American's as a glitch in the matrix; of being transported to a parallel universe in which a loutish red-haired charlatan, a bully accused of being a serial abuser of women – while bragging that as a famous man he can get away with anything – becomes the president of the United States. Wielding power in a manner devoid of compassion and decency is innate to narcissist Trump. Power to the likes of Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump is a tool to bully, humiliate and coerce others into doing things which they would never do. It comes as no surprise then to see President Trump take the unprecedented step of threatening to cut US funding to countries that oppose his decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital in a UN vote today. The threat is Weinsteinian in its depravity. One imagines Trump saying to himself: If you want me to use my power and wealth to help you, then you need to humiliate yourself by performing demeaning political favours, which no self-respecting country would ever debase themselves to doing. In the characteristically simpleton parallel universe that Trump inhabits, the logic is straightforward: "They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars, and then they vote against us. Well, we're watching those votes. Let them vote against us. We'll save a lot. We don't care." Read: Why America's declaration on Jerusalem is wrong The reality of course is very different. US aid is not a gift bestowed by the president to demonstrate American benevolence to impoverished nations. The main purpose of aid is the advancement of national self-interest. Aid is an instrument of power, deployed by powerful states to carry influence amongst weaker states. According to a former State Department official and aid expert Carol Lancaster modern US aid originated in Cold War geopolitics. "The Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe," the Council on Foreign Relations points out, "was designed to blunt the influence of rising Communist political forces on the continent. National security concerns have continued to drive US assistance policy, aiming to provide stability in conflicted regions, bolster allies, promote democracy, or contribute to counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts abroad." Who are the recipients of the $49 billion (1.3 per cent of the federal budget) distributed by the US: with $3.1 billion Israel is far and away the biggest recipient of US aid followed by Egypt which receives $1.5 billion. In fact a number of Arab and Muslim majority countries receive significant amounts of aid from the US to fund a complex stew of programmes that include promoting liberal values to security and counterterrorism. Reflecting the close relation between US aid and US power is the significant increase to the budget of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. During the 1990s aid levels were cut to barely half of what they are today, falling to less than $20 billion in 1997, or 0.8 per cent of the overall budget. The terrorist attack on the US, however, prompted the Bush administration to embark on a "crusade" armed with the world's largest military arsenal and an aid budget that that would be the envy of any superpower in world history determined to win political favour using financial bribes. Read: If Jerusalem is Israel's capital, then Washington is Bolivia's capital The story of aid is not as straightforward as Trump would like it to be. Foreign aid in actual fact provides massive financial gains for donor countries. What poor countries received through aid is minuscule compared to the vast sums that are extracted by affluent Western capitals. The sustained and significant outflows from the developing countries since the eighties have topped $16.3 trillion. To put it another way, the outflow of wealth from developing nations over the intervening period equals the GDP of the US. Foreign aid is part of a complex global structure in which donors and recipients clearly recognise the mutual benefit of having a means to exchange favours under the guise of the redistribution of wealth. This is one of the main reasons why western governments are reluctant to reduce the aid budget despite pressure from large sections of society. As with much of what Trump has done since moving into the White House, this unprecedented move, one expects, will work against him. Despite what Trump may think, aid has already bought the US untold political favours and no self-respecting government, however poor, will allow themselves to be bullied into thinking they are a basket case in need of US generosity. If Trump's bulling tactic does anything of significance, it should awaken a sense of national pride amongst recipients of US aid. "No honourable state would bow to such pressure," said the Foreign Minister of Turkey – a co-sponsor of the UN vote – Mevlut Cavusoglu. "The world has changed. The belief that 'I am strong therefore I am right' has changed. The world today is revolting against injustices." Others have denounced the threat saying "states resort to such blatant bullying only when they know they do not have a moral or legal argument to convince others." Even a senior western diplomat, described it as "poor tactics" but not one which is "going to win any votes in the General Assembly or the Security Council". A senior European diplomat agreed Haley was unlikely to sway many UN states. US Congress has also called Trump on his bluff, with condemnations from key Democratic lawmakers who have poured water over the idea that Congress would allow him to carry out such an unprecedented threat. No pragmatic US politician would wish to play the aid card, as Trump has done, over an issue like Jerusalem. Not least because the draft resolution reaffirms numerous Security Council resolutions on Jerusalem, dating back to 1967, including requirements that the city's final status must be decided in direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Not to mention of course that the resolution had been US policy over five decades. Today's vote will be a defining moment for the international community, and more so for the Arab Gulf states allied to the Trump administration. It is not just a vote over the fate of Jerusalem and the millions of Palestinians suffering under the brutal Israeli occupation. The 193 members of the General Assembly are being asked to choose what kind of politics they want on the playground of the international stage. Are they going to reward a bully who challenges basic decency and forever be held hostage to their cowardice or stand up to the bully as everyone should.

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 complementary.

The image shows Donald Trump, the president of the United States, speaking in public. The news events set is about Trump's threat to cut US funding to countries that oppose his decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The image is complementary to the news events set because it shows Trump speaking in public, which is a common occurrence for a president. The image also shows Trump with a serious expression on his face, which suggests that he is speaking about something important. The image is cropped in such a way that Trump's face is the only thing in focus, which suggests that he is the most important person in the image. The image is also taken from a low angle, which makes Trump look larger and more powerful. All of these factors suggest that the image is trying to convey a message about Trump's power and importance. This message is consistent with the news events set, which is about Trump's threat to cut US funding to countries that oppose his decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

Not to mention of course that the resolution had been US policy over five decades. Today's vote will be a defining moment for the international community, and more so for the Arab Gulf states allied to the Trump administration. It is not just a vote over the fate of Jerusalem and the millions of Palestinians suffering under the brutal Israeli occupation. The 193 members of the General Assembly are being asked to choose what kind of politics they want on the playground of the international stage. Are they going to reward a bully who challenges basic decency and forever be held hostage to their cowardice or stand up to the bully as everyone should.

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 complementary.

The image shows US President Donald Trump looking up from a piece of paper while sitting in a meeting. The image is taken from a low angle, which makes Trump look powerful and imposing. The background is blurred, which helps to focus attention on Trump. The image is cropped in such a way that Trump's face is the only thing in focus, which further emphasizes his importance.

The news events set is about Trump's threat to cut US funding to countries that oppose his decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The image is complementary to the news events set because it shows Trump looking serious and determined, which suggests that he is not bluffing about his threat. The image also shows Trump in a position of power, which suggests that he is capable of carrying out his threat.


News article:
The torment of waking up to a Trump presidency has been described by some American's as a glitch in the matrix; of being transported to a parallel universe in which a loutish red-haired charlatan, a bully accused of being a serial abuser of women – while bragging that as a famous man he can get away with anything – becomes the president of the United States. Wielding power in a manner devoid of compassion and decency is innate to narcissist Trump. Power to the likes of Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump is a tool to bully, humiliate and coerce others into doing things which they would never do. It comes as no surprise then to see President Trump take the unprecedented step of threatening to cut US funding to countries that oppose his decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital in a UN vote today. The threat is Weinsteinian in its depravity. One imagines Trump saying to himself: If you want me to use my power and wealth to help you, then you need to humiliate yourself by performing demeaning political favours, which no self-respecting country would ever debase themselves to doing. In the characteristically simpleton parallel universe that Trump inhabits, the logic is straightforward: "They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars, and then they vote against us. Well, we're watching those votes. Let them vote against us. We'll save a lot. We don't care." Read: Why America's declaration on Jerusalem is wrong The reality of course is very different. US aid is not a gift bestowed by the president to demonstrate American benevolence to impoverished nations. The main purpose of aid is the advancement of national self-interest. Aid is an instrument of power, deployed by powerful states to carry influence amongst weaker states. According to a former State Department official and aid expert Carol Lancaster modern US aid originated in Cold War geopolitics. "The Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe," the Council on Foreign Relations points out, "was designed to blunt the influence of rising Communist political forces on the continent. National security concerns have continued to drive US assistance policy, aiming to provide stability in conflicted regions, bolster allies, promote democracy, or contribute to counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts abroad." Who are the recipients of the $49 billion (1.3 per cent of the federal budget) distributed by the US: with $3.1 billion Israel is far and away the biggest recipient of US aid followed by Egypt which receives $1.5 billion. In fact a number of Arab and Muslim majority countries receive significant amounts of aid from the US to fund a complex stew of programmes that include promoting liberal values to security and counterterrorism. Reflecting the close relation between US aid and US power is the significant increase to the budget of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. During the 1990s aid levels were cut to barely half of what they are today, falling to less than $20 billion in 1997, or 0.8 per cent of the overall budget. The terrorist attack on the US, however, prompted the Bush administration to embark on a "crusade" armed with the world's largest military arsenal and an aid budget that that would be the envy of any superpower in world history determined to win political favour using financial bribes. Read: If Jerusalem is Israel's capital, then Washington is Bolivia's capital The story of aid is not as straightforward as Trump would like it to be. Foreign aid in actual fact provides massive financial gains for donor countries. What poor countries received through aid is minuscule compared to the vast sums that are extracted by affluent Western capitals. The sustained and significant outflows from the developing countries since the eighties have topped $16.3 trillion. To put it another way, the outflow of wealth from developing nations over the intervening period equals the GDP of the US. Foreign aid is part of a complex global structure in which donors and recipients clearly recognise the mutual benefit of having a means to exchange favours under the guise of the redistribution of wealth. This is one of the main reasons why western governments are reluctant to reduce the aid budget despite pressure from large sections of society. As with much of what Trump has done since moving into the White House, this unprecedented move, one expects, will work against him. Despite what Trump may think, aid has already bought the US untold political favours and no self-respecting government, however poor, will allow themselves to be bullied into thinking they are a basket case in need of US generosity. If Trump's bulling tactic does anything of significance, it should awaken a sense of national pride amongst recipients of US aid. "No honourable state would bow to such pressure," said the Foreign Minister of Turkey – a co-sponsor of the UN vote – Mevlut Cavusoglu. "The world has changed. The belief that 'I am strong therefore I am right' has changed. The world today is revolting against injustices." Others have denounced the threat saying "states resort to such blatant bullying only when they know they do not have a moral or legal argument to convince others." Even a senior western diplomat, described it as "poor tactics" but not one which is "going to win any votes in the General Assembly or the Security Council". A senior European diplomat agreed Haley was unlikely to sway many UN states. US Congress has also called Trump on his bluff, with condemnations from key Democratic lawmakers who have poured water over the idea that Congress would allow him to carry out such an unprecedented threat. No pragmatic US politician would wish to play the aid card, as Trump has done, over an issue like Jerusalem. Not least because the draft resolution reaffirms numerous Security Council resolutions on Jerusalem, dating back to 1967, including requirements that the city's final status must be decided in direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Not to mention of course that the resolution had been US policy over five decades. Today's vote will be a defining moment for the international community, and more so for the Arab Gulf states allied to the Trump administration. It is not just a vote over the fate of Jerusalem and the millions of Palestinians suffering under the brutal Israeli occupation. The 193 members of the General Assembly are being asked to choose what kind of politics they want on the playground of the international stage.

News article:
Donald Trump’s newly announced national security strategy has prompted a Russian scramble to defend Russian interests, with the Kremlin announcing the White House’s endorsement of a “peace through strength” principle a confrontational bid that undermines hopes for a breakthrough in US-Russian relations. It has also triggered an Iranian escalation, with the first response coming in Yemen where the Houthi rebels fired a ballistic missile into inhabited areas south of the Saudi capital Riyadh. The Trump administration also inflamed a third front omitted by the national security strategy, when the US president detonated a bombshell by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, infuriating and embarrassing Arab and Muslim friends and allies of the United States. The US envoy to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, took the crisis to the next level by deploying vetoing a Security Council draft resolution rejecting Washington’s Jerusalem move and calling for its withdrawal. The resolution was backed by all other 14 Security Council members, prompting Haley to vow that her country would remember this “insult”. When Arab and Muslim nations put forward a similar resolution at the General Assembly, Haley threatened that Washington was “taking names” and watching which countries would vote which way. In an unprecedented move in the history of the UN, the US President threatened to cut off aid from countries voting in favor of the resolution, saying: “Let them vote against us…We’ll save a lot. We don’t care. But this isn’t like it used to be where they could vote against you and then you pay them hundreds of millions of dollars”. Donald Trump’s statements meant to coerce American aid recipients to accept his dictates are humiliating. Furthermore, they have no value vis-a-vis the US’ strategic partners that do not need US aid, such as Saudi Arabia, whose king Salman bin Abdulaziz was meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on the day of the vote to show Riyadh’s support for Palestinian rights. Indeed, how does the Trump administration intend to “punish” the Saudi, Emirati, and Egyptian votes in favor of the UN General Assembly resolution, in light of the important strategic relations between these countries and Washington? Advertisement There are a lot of signs of immature policies in the conduct of the Trump administration at the UN, where every member state is fully entitled to vote in any way it suits it. This is a shaming, dictating, bullying, and coercing strategy that does not serve US long-term interests, not to mention that it violates the most basic principles of democracy and respect for different views. Worst of all, this strategy upends international legitimacy and the norms governing international relations, regardless of whether or not the scrutiny of a sovereign decision by way of a Security Council resolution was a political mistake or an affront against the US. When Egypt, the only current Arab member of the Security Council, put forward a draft resolution calling on the US to withdraw its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and the transfer of the US embassy there, it wanted to reaffirm previous UN Security Council resolutions that demand no change in the status of Jerusalem except through negotiations between the two parties. Trump’s measures that sought to completely alter this facet of US foreign policy therefore appear arbitrary, even in the context of US grand strategy and national security. The reason, according to one observer close to the Trump administration, is that Trump is picking and choosing from the demands of three rival camps in his administration fighting to shape his final decisions, and as a result, the implementation of many of these decisions is effectively on hold. According to the same source, the first camp considers China to be the foremost long-term challenge for US interests, followed by Iran and Turkey in the near term. The proponents of this view want the administration to bolster Russia, even if this requires compromises such as on accepting Bashar al-Assad’s survival in power in Syria. For this camp, China’s challenge includes the North Korean challenge, yet both are of a long-term nature. Meanwhile, Iran, Turkey, Qatar, and Hezbollah are seen as challenges of a near-term nature. The mantra of this camp, dominated by alt-right voices such as Steve Bannon, is the necessity of eliminating radical Islamic terror, in both its Sunni and Shia iterations. Advertisement The second camp, led by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and national security adviser H. R. McMaster, accepts the first camp’s view regarding the need for a strategic alliance with Gulf countries against Islamic radicalism, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, through firm policies and reforms. This camp wants to preserve the cohesion of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), but insists that Qatar’s policies deviate from the Gulf line and threaten Gulf unity. This camp considers Iran a major problem in Iraq and Syria, while Lebanon for them has already fallen “militarily and politically,” as the source put it. Regarding Russia, this camp does not trust Putin and does not believe he would abandon Iran, and calls for further pressure on Russia, Iran, and Assad. The third camp in the Trump administration favors the status quo. It sees in former President Barack Obama’s approach to Iran an example to be emulated, and therefore, does not see Iran as a threat. This camp is led by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who sometimes gets support from Defense Secretary James Mattis, for example with regard to their view that North Korea’s threat to US interests should be prioritized. Tillerson does not see the value of a strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

On April 7 , however, he stunned even many of his supporters by authorizing the launching of missile strikes on an airbase of the Syrian Army after an alleged chemical attack in the town of Khan Shaykhun. The perpetrators of the attack have still not been identified by a UN investigation, however the US president and his ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley immediately held Syrian president Bashar al-Assad responsible. While the missile attack caused many of his own supporters to begin doubting the sincerity of his non-interventionist promises, the attack received widespread approval in the American media, with many prominent commentators identifying it as the point at which he, "became presidential." Iran Nuclear Agreement Having condemned as a candidate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, agreed between the United States, Great Britain, France, Russia, China, Germany and Iran to suspend elements of the latter's nuclear program, as president, Mr. Trump set about indicating that he was intending to sink the agreement altogether and re-impose sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Despite the International Atomic Energy Agency's repeated certifications that Iran is complying with the terms of the agreement, President Trump has persisted in claiming the Islamic Republic is not complying with "the spirit of the agreement." His decertification of Iranian compliance with the JCPOA and his insistence that Congress reimpose sanctions within 60 days or he will, drew hostile responses even from close US allies. Federica Mogherini, the EU's foreign policy chief flatly rejected the US' ability to sink the agreement, saying that no single country could do so.

News article:
Paris (AFP) - From the inauguration of US President Donald Trump to the exodus of Rohingyas from Myanmar, here are 12 events that marked 2017. - A year of Trump - On January 20 Republican billionaire Donald Trump, 70, is inaugurated as US president, vowing: "America first." Suspicions of collusion between his election campaign and Russia dog the start of his term. Trump progressively unpicks the achievements of his Democrat predecessor, Barack Obama. He pulls out of international agreements on climate, free trade, immigration and UNESCO. On December 6, in another break with the previous administration, Trump creates shockwaves when he recognises Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a move largely rejected in a UN vote. On December 20 he seals his first major reform, signing long-awaited tax cuts into law. - Brexit under way - On March 29 London launches the process to quit the European Union, as voted in a referendum nine months earlier. In a snap general election on June 8 Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives suffer a major setback and lose their majority. Brussels and London agree on divorce terms on December 8. - France: political earthquake - Pro-EU centrist Emmanuel Macron, 39, wins a resounding victory over far-right rival Marine Le Pen in France's presidential election on May 7. His new En Marche (One the Move) movement drives the two biggest parties -- the Socialists and Republicans -- from the Elysee Palace for the first time. - Middle East: boiling point - Saudi Arabia and its allies sever diplomatic ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it supporting "terrorists" and of being too close to Iran. Then on November 4 Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri announces from the Saudi capital that he is resigning, citing Iran's "grip" on his country. He later backtracks. Saudi Arabia also accuses rebels in Yemen of receiving support from Iran, which denies the accusation. The UN describes Yemen's humanitarian situation as the worst in the world in 2017. Story continues - Venezuela: economic disaster - On July 30 Venezuela's Constituent Assembly -- whose legitimacy is disputed by the opposition and abroad -- is elected after four months of deadly protests against socialist President Nicolas Maduro. With wide-ranging powers, it dismisses in early August Attorney General Luisa Ortega, one of Maduro's top critics. It then takes over the opposition-dominated Congress. Crippled by plummeting oil prices, the country is considered to be in "selective default" by ratings agencies. - North Korea: escalation - The reclusive regime conducts its sixth and largest nuclear test on September 3. On November 29 leader Kim Jong-Un says a "state nuclear force" has been completed with the test of a long-range missile able to deliver a nuclear warhead anywhere in the United States. Washington threatens to "utterly destroy" the regime "if war comes". On December 22 the UN Security Council imposes new sanctions against North Korea that restrict vital oil supplies. - Myanmar's Rohingyas: 'genocide' - On August 25 the military in Buddhist-majority Myanmar launches a crackdown on Rohingyas after militants from the stateless Muslim minority ambush security forces. Nearly 655,000 Rohingyas find refuge in Bangladesh. The United States denounces "ethnic cleansing" while the UN speaks of "elements of genocide". - Catalonia: autonomy suspended - Spain's wealthy northeastern Catalonia region holds a referendum for independence on October 1 that is deemed illegal by the central government. Madrid moves to assert control but Catalan lawmakers vote on October 27 to declare independence. Madrid dismisses Catalonia's government and suspends its autonomy, also calling regional elections. Deposed regional president Carles Puigdemont, charged with sedition and rebellion, takes refuge in Belgium. On December 21 three pro-independence parties defeat the central government in the elections. However, the centrist, anti-independence Ciudadanos party gets the best individual result. - The Weinstein scandal - On October 5 the New York Times publishes a bombshell investigative report accusing Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, 65, of sexual harassment over decades. Similar allegations have since been levelled at a long list of personalities in film, television, journalism and politics around the world. - Zimbabwe: Mugabe falls - Zimbabwe's veteran President Robert Mugabe, 93, resigns on November 21 following 37 years of rule and after being abandoned by the military and his own party. - IS defeated, not wiped out - Iraq on December 9 declares victory in its war to expel the Islamic State group but experts warn that jihadists remain a threat. They have also lost most of their territory in Syria. Numerous deadly attacks around the world over the year, including in Afghanistan, Britain, Egypt and Somalia, are claimed by or blamed on the group or others linked to Al-Qaeda. - Climate: record disasters - The year in which Trump decides, on June 1, to leave the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord is marked by a series of natural disasters, including record-breaking hurricanes, earthquakes and devastating fires that affect several countries. It is set to be one of the three warmest years ever recorded.

News article:
After the political earthquakes of 2016, 2017 was unlikely to be easy. And it was not. From Donald Trump being the president to Britain's exit decision from the EU and the turmoil in the Middle East, 2017 was a year that many cannot wait to leave behind. But can we be optimistic for 2018 after the increasing turbulence and tensions of the past 12 months? The year 2018 will be the second year of Trump in the White House. Many predicted at the beginning of 2017 that Trump would resign by the year's end. In fact, it was not a prediction, but a prayer that has remained unanswered until now. Democrats introduced articles of impeachment against Trump in November, though they admitted that their efforts would be unsuccessful while Republicans control both houses of Congress. Some senators called on Trump to resign over the allegations of sexual misconduct in December, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation can be seen as if he is getting closer to Trump with each new finding. One might think that Trump is backed into a corner, however, with Israel's backing and Saudi Arabia's financial support, he is more powerful than before. That is why it is likely that he will still be in office at the end of 2018. Due to political divisions shaking America, the U.S. presence abroad has been weakened. It looks like increasing doubts and tensions regarding the U.S. role in the world will continue in 2018, which will probably be followed for the next several years. A weakened U.S. means some gaps on the stage of world politics, which might be filled by global powers like China and Russia. China will probably increase its activities in the Sea of Japan in 2018 even though Japan will further complain about it, while Russia will continue its military presence in Syria, or we can say the Middle East. One can bet that Vladimir Putin will be re-elected as the Russian president in March. The war in Ukraine will continue as the Trump administration recently approved a plan to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine, and Moscow is not likely to step back. If Russia-backed forces continue to gain more territory on the ground, that kind of development will whip up the European NATO allies. However, we cannot be really sure if the U.S. will stand side by side with them as it always did, since we know Trump has implicitly warned NATO allies many times that they should not expect what former administrations did in the past from him. He finally did say that the U.S. would defend them if Russia's stance hardens after too much internal and external pressure, but I am not sure if European leaders have found that final statement convincing. In the aftermath of the Brexit vote of 2016 and Trump's being elected, many in the EU were concerned that the extreme right would win in their electoral contests in 2017. It was close but did not happen. Many countries passed the test and gained some time, but it is obvious that rising ethnic, demographic and economic tensions as well as Eurosceptisim and populism will continue to gain ground. There might be some big protests as economic problems in European countries continue. And there is still the risk that other countries would like to get out of the EU, such as Italy, which will hold a general election in 2018. Angela Merkel of Germany won the elections in October but is still struggling to form a coalition government. We can say that Germany may have to go back to the polls in 2018. That means Europe will not get back its strongest voice for a while. The Brexit negotiations may result in a real plan but new problems are inevitable until Britain leaves the union in March 2019. It has never been easy to make predictions about North Korea. In addition, the Trump administration makes things more unpredictable. Still, I do not think that the U.S. and North Korea will enter into a large-scale war. But this is not to say that the tension will not continue to rise alongside the battle of words between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump. India's provincial elections, which are seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Pakistan's general elections might escalate regional tensions in Asia, while it is almost sure that Saudi Arabia and Iran will increase regional turbulence in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman's unpredictability will most likely continue in 2018, which will further destabilize the region. And we cannot be sure if the power play between Saudi Arabia and Iran will hit which Middle Eastern country next. The seven-year civil war in Syria might be close to an end after the de-escalation zones plan agreed to by Russia, Iran and Turkey in the Astana rounds. But we cannot say if the approximately 6 million Syrian refugees from Syria would be eager to return to their country in 2018, considering the fact that Bashar Assad, the Syrian dictator who has been the reason of all the bloodshed in the first place, is still in Damascus. We are not talking about the Daesh threat, as a priority anymore, but there is still a risk of Daesh or another terrorist group posing a new threat unless the Middle East finds peace, and that dream is not seen on the horizon yet. After Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Palestine would probably shape regional alliances will be a key topic, but I believe it will be a short while since a new chaos or hot conflict will emerge in another zone on the map, and will cause a distraction as it always happens. It already looks like 2018 will be a year of new crises caused by unprecedented environment, rising populist trends and ongoing tensions. And we have not put global economic risks into the equation yet. But I must say that the risks of new economic crises, which would be big enough to shake the countries, regions and maybe the world, are the ones that scare me most in 2018, and the possibilities of natural disasters, which might shake the earth.

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 complementary.

The image is a map of the world, colored according to the level of press freedom in each country. The news events set is about the political events that are likely to happen in 2018. The image is complementary to the news events set because it provides a visual representation of the different levels of press freedom around the world, which is relevant to the news events set because many of the events are likely to be affected by the level of press freedom in each country. For example, the news event about China's increasing activities in the Sea of Japan is likely to be affected by the level of press freedom in China, as a free press would be more likely to report on any negative consequences of China's actions.

It looks like increasing doubts and tensions regarding the U.S. role in the world will continue in 2018, which will probably be followed for the next several years. A weakened U.S. means some gaps on the stage of world politics, which might be filled by global powers like China and Russia. China will probably increase its activities in the Sea of Japan in 2018 even though Japan will further complain about it, while Russia will continue its military presence in Syria, or we can say the Middle East. One can bet that Vladimir Putin will be re-elected as the Russian president in March. The war in Ukraine will continue as the Trump administration recently approved a plan to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine, and Moscow is not likely to step back. If Russia-backed forces continue to gain more territory on the ground, that kind of development will whip up the European NATO allies. However, we cannot be really sure if the U.S. will stand side by side with them as it always did, since we know Trump has implicitly warned NATO allies many times that they should not expect what former administrations did in the past from him. He finally did say that the U.S. would defend them if Russia's stance hardens after too much internal and external pressure, but I am not sure if European leaders have found that final statement convincing. In the aftermath of the Brexit vote of 2016 and Trump's being elected, many in the EU were concerned that the extreme right would win in their electoral contests in 2017. It was close but did not happen. Many countries passed the test and gained some time, but it is obvious that rising ethnic, demographic and economic tensions as well as Eurosceptisim and populism will continue to gain ground. There might be some big protests as economic problems in European countries continue. And there is still the risk that other countries would like to get out of the EU, such as Italy, which will hold a general election in 2018. Angela Merkel of Germany won the elections in October but is still struggling to form a coalition government. We can say that Germany may have to go back to the polls in 2018. That means Europe will not get back its strongest voice for a while. The Brexit negotiations may result in a real plan but new problems are inevitable until Britain leaves the union in March 2019. It has never been easy to make predictions about North Korea. In addition, the Trump administration makes things more unpredictable. Still, I do not think that the U.S. and North Korea will enter into a large-scale war. But this is not to say that the tension will not continue to rise alongside the battle of words between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump. India's provincial elections, which are seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Pakistan's general elections might escalate regional tensions in Asia, while it is almost sure that Saudi Arabia and Iran will increase regional turbulence in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman's unpredictability will most likely continue in 2018, which will further destabilize the region. And we cannot be sure if the power play between Saudi Arabia and Iran will hit which Middle Eastern country next. The seven-year civil war in Syria might be close to an end after the de-escalation zones plan agreed to by Russia, Iran and Turkey in the Astana rounds. But we cannot say if the approximately 6 million Syrian refugees from Syria would be eager to return to their country in 2018, considering the fact that Bashar Assad, the Syrian dictator who has been the reason of all the bloodshed in the first place, is still in Damascus. We are not talking about the Daesh threat, as a priority anymore, but there is still a risk of Daesh or another terrorist group posing a new threat unless the Middle East finds peace, and that dream is not seen on the horizon yet. After Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Palestine would probably shape regional alliances will be a key topic, but I believe it will be a short while since a new chaos or hot conflict will emerge in another zone on the map, and will cause a distraction as it always happens. It already looks like 2018 will be a year of new crises caused by unprecedented environment, rising populist trends and ongoing tensions. And we have not put global economic risks into the equation yet. But I must say that the risks of new economic crises, which would be big enough to shake the countries, regions and maybe the world, are the ones that scare me most in 2018, and the possibilities of natural disasters, which might shake the earth.

News article:
The world, to say nothing of two-thirds of the people in this country, deplores Donald Trump. It rejects his racist, sexist rhetoric, his wild and foolish pronouncements, his arrogance, his abundant manifestations of malignant narcissism. The world deplores his withdrawal from the Paris Accord, his rejection of the painstakingly negotiated Iran nuclear agreement, and now his decision–opposed by his leading advisors (except for his son-in-law Jared Kushner)–to recognize, as no other nation save the occupying power Israel ever has, occupied Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The recent UN General Assembly vote implicitly condemning Trump’s decision – which so infuriated the clueless US UN ambassador, Nikki Haley – was a harsh rebuke to Trump. But did it not reflect a broader repudiation of the contemporary USA? A recent Pew poll, taken before the Jerusalem announcement, showed that only 49 percent of the world’s people now see the U.S. favorably. Trump argues validly that he has simply made official what has been US policy since 1995, when Congress, pressured by the Israel Lobby, passed the ‘Jerusalem Embassy Act.’ The move was politically unproblematic within the US; at the time nearly 50 percent of US residents told pollsters they believed that “God gave Israel to the Jews.” The mix of Lobby influence, Christian Evangelical credence to biblical myth (Genesis 12:3), general historical ignorance and racist indifference to the plight of a cruelly oppressed and humiliated people produced that vote (of 374 to 37 in the House and 93 to 5 in the Senate). That is to say: this preposterous recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the whole of Jerusalem, including – as it necessarily does – an open attack on Palestinian rights, is not merely another eccentric work of Trump. It is a natural emanation of US imperialist culture. The Obama presidency showed how a leader continuing and expanding on his predecessor’s assault on the Middle East could maintain high domestic ratings; enjoy the respect of the leaders of allied states, such as the UK, France and Germany; and if we can believe the polls even receive a generally positive reception from the world’s people. But the Trump presidency shows how a leader staying his predecessors’ course on Afghanistan, Iraq and even to a considerable extent Syria (these involvements, and US knee-jerk support for Israel, being the key source of global hatred for the US) can only retain the support of one-third of the US population. This is due to his manifest ignorance, bigotry and general buffoonery. It shows too that there are limits to western allies’ deference. Angela Merkel, Theresa May and Emmanuel Marcon have all had harsh words for Trump on climate, Iran, trade, immigration, Islam, Korea threats, and now Jerusalem. This is good. Fractures in the unholy alliance called NATO, the anti-Russian alliance which successive US administrations have sought to expand, and which under Trump’s watch has now included Montenegro, can only be positive. Let Washington’s current imperialist partners conclude that the US cannot lead the world in a direction that advantages them. Let them conclude that the preposterous Jerusalem decision, which can only produce more violence, is the last straw. Let the European masses realize that Europe’s refugee crisis is the fruit of US interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya that made no sense. Let them realize that Washington’s drive to include Ukraine in NATO through the February 2014 putsch led to Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and the US-mandated sanctions on Russia damaging European economies.

The image shows the US net foreign asset position as a share of GDP from 1992 to 2021. The data is from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The chart shows that the US net foreign asset position has been declining since 1992. This trend is likely to continue as the US continues to run a trade deficit. The news events set is about Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. This decision has been condemned by the United Nations and many other countries. It is likely to further isolate the US from the rest of the world. The image and the news events set are aligned because they both show how the US is becoming more isolated from the rest of the world.

News article:
Photo illustration by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images The United States was about 48 hours into the new year and, for a sweet, brief moment, it seemed like the political news cycle would be uncoupled from the presidential Twitter feed. But, alas, just two days into 2018, President Donald Trump, itching for controversy following a relatively quiet holiday break, sent off a barrage of missives with far-reaching international and domestic implications. Here’s a round-up of president’s Twitter feed from the first Tuesday of the year. 363 days to go. He Attacked Former Hillary Clinton Aide Huma Abedin Crooked Hillary Clinton’s top aid, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018 Advertisement Trump renewed his attacks against former 2016 presidential election rival Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, calling for one of her top aides, Huma Abedin, to be jailed. His message ― which also included a hit at what he called the “deep state Justice Department” ― apparently referenced emails sent by Abedin that were released by the State Department on Friday. Trump has continued to attack Clinton and her team more than a year after he was elected president. Read more here. He Called Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man” And Said He Had A “Much Bigger” Nuclear Button North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2018 Trump taunted Kim Jong Un on Tuesday, just a day after the North Korean leader warned the U.S. that Kim had a nuclear button “always on [his] desk” and that the entire United States was “within range of our nuclear weapons.” Earlier in the day, the president once again demeaned Kim as a “rocket man” and later tweeted that his own nuclear button was “a much bigger & more powerful one than his.” Advertisement “And my Button works!” Trump finished. Read more here. He Threatened To Cut Off Foreign Aid To The Palestinians It's not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing, but also many other countries, and others. As an example, we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018 The White House also appeared to threaten hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid to the Palestinians on Tuesday, just hours after America said it would withhold similar funds from Pakistan. Trump lambasted the Palestinians for not giving the U.S. “appreciation or respect,” and accused their leaders of abandoning the peace process with Israel. Tension has risen throughout the Middle East in recent weeks following Trump’s decision to relocate the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Read more here. He Announced Plans For “The Most Dishonest & Corrupt” Media Awards I will be announcing THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR on Monday at 5:00 o’clock. Subjects will cover Dishonesty & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media. Stay tuned! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2018 The president continued his almost daily attacks on the media on Tuesday with a vague joke that he would establish something called “THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR.” Advertisement “Subjects will cover Dishonesty & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media,” he wrote. Earlier Tuesday, Trump lobbed an attack against his favored punching bag, the “Failing” New York Times, and its new publisher. “Get impartial journalists of a much higher standard, lose all of your phony and non-existent “sources,” and treat the President of the United States FAIRLY, so that the next time I (and the people) win, you won’t have to write an apology to your readers for a job poorly done!” Read more here. He Took Credit For The Safety Record Of Commercial Jet Airliners Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news - it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017, the best and safest year on record! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018 Commercial airlines recorded their safest year ever in 2017 after documenting zero accidental deaths on commercial passenger jets around the world. Advertisement Trump moved to take credit for the record early Tuesday, linking the lack of fatalities to his efforts to be “very strict on commercial aviation.” But, as HuffPost’s Ethan Klapper notes, such boasts appear to be overstated. 2017 was just as safe for U.S. aviation as both 2015 and 2016, and the numbers reported this week account for commercial flights worldwide.

Subjects will cover Dishonesty & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media. Stay tuned! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2018 The president continued his almost daily attacks on the media on Tuesday with a vague joke that he would establish something called “THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR.” Advertisement “Subjects will cover Dishonesty & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media,” he wrote. Earlier Tuesday, Trump lobbed an attack against his favored punching bag, the “Failing” New York Times, and its new publisher. “Get impartial journalists of a much higher standard, lose all of your phony and non-existent “sources,” and treat the President of the United States FAIRLY, so that the next time I (and the people) win, you won’t have to write an apology to your readers for a job poorly done!” Read more here. He Took Credit For The Safety Record Of Commercial Jet Airliners Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news - it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017, the best and safest year on record! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018 Commercial airlines recorded their safest year ever in 2017 after documenting zero accidental deaths on commercial passenger jets around the world. Advertisement Trump moved to take credit for the record early Tuesday, linking the lack of fatalities to his efforts to be “very strict on commercial aviation.” But, as HuffPost’s Ethan Klapper notes, such boasts appear to be overstated. 2017 was just as safe for U.S. aviation as both 2015 and 2016, and the numbers reported this week account for commercial flights worldwide.

News article:
When two strongest democracies in the world elected Donald Trump as US president and Narendra Modi as India’s prime minister, peace became the first casualty and their lethal combination along with Israel only added to the miseries of millions of peace-lovers across the world. While one was expecting New Year greetings, Donald Trump dropped a ‘New Year bomb’, on Pakistan. Surprisingly, the world’s only super power’s foreign policy these days is being run through Twitter, and no one can beat US President Donald Trump in this mad race of social media. You can trigger war through one tweet but, not peace. Let us first sympathise with the American people, who themselves got the biggest surprised when he was elected as the president, defeated a much more mature and experienced Hillary Clinton. The world’s most liberal democracy had never voted a woman to the White House while Pakistan become the first Muslim country, which elected woman as a prime minister, not once but twice. She was the late Benazir Bhutto. Many thought Ms Clinton would become the first woman in the US to get elected as president. So, which country has more moderate approach when it comes to electing its president or prime minister? Freedom of the Press became the first casualty under Trump, whose war with the media, started much before he got elected and has not ended yet. He calls the US media ‘fake news’.Even on the moral ground, he faced criticism over his attitude, and his approach towards women, is no secret to the world and the Americans themselves are not sure how to deal with this most amazing president. Many thought he would be unpredictable but, in the last one year, he proved to be the most predictable president of the United States, and that too on a fast pace. His policies, unfortunately, has endangered the world peace.For instance, when the world rejected Trump’s decision on Jerusalem, he refused to respect the UN and 146 countries. On the contrary, his government created history by threatening all those who opposed the US policy with a threat to teach them a lesson. Trump’s tweet or threat should be taken as the first step towards that policy. What else one can expect from Trump doctrine except for hate, distrust and insult to the huge sacrifices of the people of Pakistan.This is what he said in what looks like a New Year message to Pakistanis. “The United States has foolishly given 33 billion dollars in aid in over the last 15 years and they have given us nothing, but lies and deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They gave safe havens to terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more.” Trump’s response of ‘No more’ came days after we said, ‘No more’ after years of ‘Do more’ rhetoric. We certainly had committed many mistakes and the biggest one was our decades old policy on Afghanistan. Mr Trump must know that Pakistan was a moderate country before US injected extremism in our policies and asked us to fight its war in 1980, in Afghanistan against Soviet invasion.In return, Pakistan got five million Afghan refugees, gun and drug culture, beside the menace of terrorism and extremism. Thousands of foreign ‘Mujahideen’ including Arabs were sent to Pakistan to fight the US war. Osama bin Laden was one of them, which years later became the world’s most wanted man and mastermind of 9/11. Pakistanis, not Americans, are fools that they trusted the US and became an American ally, soon after the birth of Pakistan. In pursuance of the US policy, the left wing politics in Pakistan was crushed through a ban on Communist Party of Pakistan in 1950s and later on a ban on National Awami Party (NAP) in the 1970s. Now, what should be our response? Pakistan’s response should not be as foolish as that of Trump as despite our own weaknesses, we are a responsible nation and the support we got in the United Nation recently provide an ample proof. So, when the world supported us, the US opposed us. Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi called a meeting of the National Security Committee on Tuesday, in which both civil and military leadership discussed the prevailing situation in the aftermath of Trump’s warning. The government and the opposition are also on one page on this issue of utmost importance. But, we also have our own problems and it is high time to change our decades old doctrine on Afghanistan. Within the country, rising extremism and terrorism has threatened country’s foundations and we need a foreign policy based on live and let live. Pakistan should neither become proxy nor need any proxy. The US has a history of doing adventures like Hiroshima and Nagasaki, from Iraq to Syria, from Afghanistan to Libya. Humans hardly matter for them when it comes to their interests.They have the history of doing this around the world. How could we forget 1977 and 1979? The US made our elected prime minister a ‘horrible example’, because he had refused to toe the American line. We were naive that we waited for 7th fleet to arrive during 1971 war. Our response should be candid and well drafted as there is no ‘Donald Trump’ in Pakistan. We just need to place on record straight: what price we had paid, not only in the last 15 years, but in the last 30 years or to be more specific since the day we decided to become an American ally in the 1950s. It is most shameful that the US president did not acknowledge huge sacrifices Pakistan has given as a nation, not in the last 15 years but in the last 40 years and beyond.It is a matter of history that the US always supported military dictatorships in Pakistan, whether it is Field Marshal Ayub Khan, General Ziaul Haq or General (retd) Pervez Musharraf. People of Pakistan have not yet forgotten its alleged role in overthrowing Pakistan’s elected prime minister, the late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a year after he was threatened with a warning of making him a ‘horrible example’, if Pakistan did not abandon its nuclear programme, which he refused and was hanged. If the US could support the UN resolution against North Korea, Iraq or against Iran, why it backed out and opposed resolution of its decision on Jerusalem.Surely, the world has changed after 9/11, one of the worst terrorist attacks, which killed over 3,000 innocent people, mostly Americans. But, there was a Pakistani by the name of ‘Hamdani’, who gave his life in rescue operations and saved many lives. In the 15 years of war, many Pakistani youngsters gave their lives in defeating terrorism. You don’t give or compare death toll in war because every human life is precious, but if the US president insists and calls American foolish in giving 35 billion dollars to Pakistan, please let us know as to how many Americans lost their lives in these years. Our fight against terrorism and extremism must continue as we cannot afford rise of non-state actors, and we must remain alert over the possible drone strikes in settled areas. Pakistan can face economic sanctions or even drone strikes.Pakistan has come a long way to make the country more responsible and peaceful, but the threat of terrorism is not over yet. It is just world’s bad luck that when it is looking for peace, two biggest democracies have elected people like Donald Trump in US and Narendra Modi in India.The writer is a senior columnist and analyst of Geo, The News and Jang.

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 complementary.

The image shows US President Donald Trump holding a map of the Middle East. The map is focused on the countries of Iran, Iraq, and Syria. Trump is pointing to a specific location on the map. The image is taken from a news conference that Trump held on January 2, 2018.

The news events set is about Trump's criticism of Pakistan. Trump has accused Pakistan of harboring terrorists and has threatened to cut off aid to the country. Pakistan has denied the allegations and has said that it is committed to fighting terrorism.

The image is complementary to the news events set because it provides visual information that helps to illustrate the story. The map shows the countries that Trump is talking about, and it helps to give a sense of the geography of the region. The image also shows Trump's facial expression and body language, which can help to convey his mood and attitude.

The image does not reflect the specific events in the news events set, but it does provide background information that helps to explain the context of the events. The image is also consistent with the overall theme of the news events set, which is Trump's criticism of Pakistan.

News article:
The problem with the current resident of the White House is that he seems to have forgotten the very ideas that he has espoused in his book “The Art of the Deal”. Even though politics is the art of the possible and politics unlike business deals with the lives and futures of people not just money and interest, Donald Trump clearly has no serious foreign policy. His policy appears to be knee jerked decisions made often to please certain constituents or funders but certainly does not rise to the level of being given the description of a well thought policy. In foreign policy, words matter. And decisions often have a life of their own that can go much further than originally expected. The international community and especially political adversaries look carefully for any sign, hint and certainly any statement that can be seen as a green, amber or red light to whatever ideas and plans they have been awaiting to unleash. Donald Trump wanted the world to think that his decision on Jerusalem was simply a sovereign US decision about recognising a reality. The White House and the US mission at the UN went out of their way to say that there is no change in policy and that the decision does not pre-judge the final status talks of the holy city. Tell that to the Israeli members of Knesset or to the central committee of the ruling right-wing Likud Party. Israeli legislatures and right-wing activists quickly understood the Jerusalem decision as a blaring greenlight to continue and escalate their efforts to strengthen Israeli occupation and control, and to put even more obstacles to any possible negotiated solution for Jerusalem and the final status of the occupied territories. The very same Trump and his sidekick who repeatedly said that the Jerusalem decision is not meant to affect final status talks, has now tweeted that in fact “Jerusalem is off the table”, and therefore that peace talks are now expected to sail through that the contentious issue of Jerusalem is no longer part of the talks. What? So the Israelis were correct in their speedy understanding of the greenlight blaring from Washington. But Trump’s appetite to cause political wreckage appears to have no end. The US now is tampering with funding to a UN agency that has been entrusted since 1948 to take care of humanitarian needs of Palestinians. The goal is to force Palestinians to come to the negotiating table. Translated — that Palestinians surrender and accept US and Israeli dictates. Political leaders even novice ones learn from their mistakes and build an accumulation of knowledge over time. Almost one year in office and President Trump clearly has not learned anything. One would expect that after the failure of his threats to financially punish all countries which voted against the UN in the General Assembly that he would think twice about using blackmail again. Cutting off aid to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) will not bring Mahmoud Abbas and any other Palestinian leader to their knees. Instead, it will embolden Palestinians even more and will once again show that the US bluffs and blackmail efforts simply do not work. What is dangerous, however, is not that blackmail will work or not, but that tampering with so many issues at the same time, Jerusalem, and refugees, the US action will produce the very same results that it claims it wants to avoid. The majority of Palestinian refugees today live in the besieged Gaza Strip. It will not cause refugees to demonstrate against Mahmoud Abbas and demand of him to quickly rush to Washington to accept whatever dictates that Trump, Kushner and Greenblatt have to offer. Even the Israeli military officials understand the dangers in putting any further pressure on innocent Palestinian refugees. The Israelis who make a modest contribution to UNRWA have in their power to totally stop the work of this UN agency, but have chosen not to stop its effort because they understand the important soothing role that this agency has as it addresses daily humanitarian needs of a population that has been forced out of their homes and who are waiting a political solution. What is clear today is that there is no serious ultimate solution, there is no strategy or policy for a Middle East solution and there is no process or mechanism that can help bring about a solution. What exists is simply a US/Israel dictate whose features we have yet to see. But if the early signs are to go by, it certainly does not have a chance of day to work.

Cutting off aid to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) will not bring Mahmoud Abbas and any other Palestinian leader to their knees. Instead, it will embolden Palestinians even more and will once again show that the US bluffs and blackmail efforts simply do not work. What is dangerous, however, is not that blackmail will work or not, but that tampering with so many issues at the same time, Jerusalem, and refugees, the US action will produce the very same results that it claims it wants to avoid. The majority of Palestinian refugees today live in the besieged Gaza Strip. It will not cause refugees to demonstrate against Mahmoud Abbas and demand of him to quickly rush to Washington to accept whatever dictates that Trump, Kushner and Greenblatt have to offer. Even the Israeli military officials understand the dangers in putting any further pressure on innocent Palestinian refugees. The Israelis who make a modest contribution to UNRWA have in their power to totally stop the work of this UN agency, but have chosen not to stop its effort because they understand the important soothing role that this agency has as it addresses daily humanitarian needs of a population that has been forced out of their homes and who are waiting a political solution. What is clear today is that there is no serious ultimate solution, there is no strategy or policy for a Middle East solution and there is no process or mechanism that can help bring about a solution. What exists is simply a US/Israel dictate whose features we have yet to see. But if the early signs are to go by, it certainly does not have a chance of day to work.

News article:
The problem with the current resident of the White House is that he seems to have forgotten the very ideas that he has espoused in his book “The Art of the Deal”. Even though politics is the art of the possible and politics unlike business deals with the lives and futures of people not just money and interest, Donald Trump clearly has no serious foreign policy. His policy appears to be knee jerked decisions made often to please certain constituents or funders but certainly does not rise to the level of being given the description of a well thought policy. In foreign policy, words matter. And decisions often have a life of their own that can go much further than originally expected. The international community and especially political adversaries look carefully for any sign, hint and certainly any statement that can be seen as a green, amber or red light to whatever ideas and plans they have been awaiting to unleash. Donald Trump wanted the world to think that his decision on Jerusalem was simply a sovereign US decision about recognising a reality. The White House and the US mission at the UN went out of their way to say that there is no change in policy and that the decision does not pre-judge the final status talks of the holy city. Tell that to the Israeli members of Knesset or to the central committee of the ruling right-wing Likud Party. Israeli legislatures and right-wing activists quickly understood the Jerusalem decision as a blaring greenlight to continue and escalate their efforts to strengthen Israeli occupation and control, and to put even more obstacles to any possible negotiated solution for Jerusalem and the final status of the occupied territories. The very same Trump and his sidekick who repeatedly said that the Jerusalem decision is not meant to affect final status talks, has now tweeted that in fact “Jerusalem is off the table”, and therefore that peace talks are now expected to sail through that the contentious issue of Jerusalem is no longer part of the talks. What? So the Israelis were correct in their speedy understanding of the greenlight blaring from Washington. But Trump’s appetite to cause political wreckage appears to have no end. The US now is tampering with funding to a UN agency that has been entrusted since 1948 to take care of humanitarian needs of Palestinians. The goal is to force Palestinians to come to the negotiating table. Translated — that Palestinians surrender and accept US and Israeli dictates. Political leaders even novice ones learn from their mistakes and build an accumulation of knowledge over time. Almost one year in office and President Trump clearly has not learned anything. One would expect that after the failure of his threats to financially punish all countries which voted against the UN in the General Assembly that he would think twice about using blackmail again. Cutting off aid to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) will not bring Mahmoud Abbas and any other Palestinian leader to their knees. Instead, it will embolden Palestinians even more and will once again show that the US bluffs and blackmail efforts simply do not work. What is dangerous, however, is not that blackmail will work or not, but that tampering with so many issues at the same time, Jerusalem, and refugees, the US action will produce the very same results that it claims it wants to avoid. The majority of Palestinian refugees today live in the besieged Gaza Strip. It will not cause refugees to demonstrate against Mahmoud Abbas and demand of him to quickly rush to Washington to accept whatever dictates that Trump, Kushner and Greenblatt have to offer. Even the Israeli military officials understand the dangers in putting any further pressure on innocent Palestinian refugees. The Israelis who make a modest contribution to UNRWA have in their power to totally stop the work of this UN agency, but have chosen not to stop its effort because they understand the important soothing role that this agency has as it addresses daily humanitarian needs of a population that has been forced out of their homes and who are waiting a political solution. What is clear today is that there is no serious ultimate solution, there is no strategy or policy for a Middle East solution and there is no process or mechanism that can help bring about a solution.

News article:
When two strongest democracies in the world elected Donald Trump as US president and Narendra Modi as India's prime minister, peace became the first casualty and their lethal combination along with Israel only added to the miseries of millions of peace-lovers across the world. While one was expecting New Year greetings, Donald Trump dropped a 'New Year bomb’, on Pakistan. Surprisingly, the world's only super power's foreign policy these days is being run through Twitter, and no one can beat US President Donald Trump in this mad race of social media. You can trigger war through one tweet but, not peace. Let us first sympathise with the American people, who themselves got the biggest surprised when he was elected as the president, defeated a much more mature and experienced Hillary Clinton. The world's most liberal democracy had never voted a woman to the White House while Pakistan become the first Muslim country, which elected woman as a prime minister, not once but twice. She was the late Benazir Bhutto. Many thought Ms Clinton would become the first woman in the US to get elected as president. So, which country has more moderate approach when it comes to electing its president or prime minister? Freedom of the Press became the first casualty under Trump, whose war with the media, started much before he got elected and has not ended yet. He calls the US media 'fake news’. Even on the moral ground, he faced criticism over his attitude, and his approach towards women, is no secret to the world and the Americans themselves are not sure how to deal with this most amazing president. Many thought he would be unpredictable but, in the last one year, he proved to be the most predictable president of the United States, and that too on a fast pace. His policies, unfortunately, has endangered the world peace. For instance, when the world rejected Trump's decision on Jerusalem, he refused to respect the UN and 146 countries. On the contrary, his government created history by threatening all those who opposed the US policy with a threat to teach them a lesson. Trump's tweet or threat should be taken as the first step towards that policy. What else one can expect from Trump doctrine except for hate, distrust and insult to the huge sacrifices of the people of Pakistan. This is what he said in what looks like a New Year message to Pakistanis. "The United States has foolishly given 33 billion dollars in aid in over the last 15 years and they have given us nothing, but lies and deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They gave safe havens to terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more." Trump's response of 'No more’ came days after we said, 'No more’ after years of 'Do more' rhetoric. We certainly had committed many mistakes and the biggest one was our decades old policy on Afghanistan. Mr Trump must know that Pakistan was a moderate country before US injected extremism in our policies and asked us to fight its war in 1980, in Afghanistan against Soviet invasion. In return, Pakistan got five million Afghan refugees, gun and drug culture, beside the menace of terrorism and extremism. Thousands of foreign 'Mujahideen' including Arabs were sent to Pakistan to fight the US war. Osama bin Laden was one of them, which years later became the world's most wanted man and mastermind of 9/11. Pakistanis, not Americans, are fools that they trusted the US and became an American ally, soon after the birth of Pakistan. In pursuance of the US policy, the left wing politics in Pakistan was crushed through a ban on Communist Party of Pakistan in 1950s and later on a ban on National Awami Party (NAP) in the 1970s. Now, what should be our response? Pakistan's response should not be as foolish as that of Trump as despite our own weaknesses, we are a responsible nation and the support we got in the United Nation recently provide an ample proof. So, when the world supported us, the US opposed us. Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi called a meeting of the National Security Committee on Tuesday, in which both civil and military leadership discussed the prevailing situation in the aftermath of Trump's warning. The government and the opposition are also on one page on this issue of utmost importance. But, we also have our own problems and it is high time to change our decades old doctrine on Afghanistan. Within the country, rising extremism and terrorism has threatened country's foundations and we need a foreign policy based on live and let live. Pakistan should neither become proxy nor need any proxy. The US has a history of doing adventures like Hiroshima and Nagasaki, from Iraq to Syria, from Afghanistan to Libya. Humans hardly matter for them when it comes to their interests. They have the history of doing this around the world. How could we forget 1977 and 1979? The US made our elected prime minister a 'horrible example’, because he had refused to toe the American line. We were naive that we waited for 7th fleet to arrive during 1971 war. Our response should be candid and well drafted as there is no 'Donald Trump' in Pakistan. We just need to place on record straight: what price we had paid, not only in the last 15 years, but in the last 30 years or to be more specific since the day we decided to become an American ally in the 1950s. It is most shameful that the US president did not acknowledge huge sacrifices Pakistan has given as a nation, not in the last 15 years but in the last 40 years and beyond. It is a matter of history that the US always supported military dictatorships in Pakistan, whether it is Field Marshal Ayub Khan, General Ziaul Haq or General (retd) Pervez Musharraf. People of Pakistan have not yet forgotten its alleged role in overthrowing Pakistan's elected prime minister, the late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a year after he was threatened with a warning of making him a 'horrible example’, if Pakistan did not abandon its nuclear programme, which he refused and was hanged. If the US could support the UN resolution against North Korea, Iraq or against Iran, why it backed out and opposed resolution of its decision on Jerusalem. Surely, the world has changed after 9/11, one of the worst terrorist attacks, which killed over 3,000 innocent people, mostly Americans. But, there was a Pakistani by the name of 'Hamdani’, who gave his life in rescue operations and saved many lives. In the 15 years of war, many Pakistani youngsters gave their lives in defeating terrorism. You don't give or compare death toll in war because every human life is precious, but if the US president insists and calls American foolish in giving 35 billion dollars to Pakistan, please let us know as to how many Americans lost their lives in these years. Our fight against terrorism and extremism must continue as we cannot afford rise of non-state actors, and we must remain alert over the possible drone strikes in settled areas. Pakistan can face economic sanctions or even drone strikes. Pakistan has come a long way to make the country more responsible and peaceful, but the threat of terrorism is not over yet. It is just world's bad luck that when it is looking for peace, two biggest democracies have elected people like Donald Trump in US and Narendra Modi in India.

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 complementary.

The image shows the results of a survey conducted by the German news organization YouGov, which asked people to rank the world leaders who they believe pose the greatest threat to world peace. The top five leaders listed are Donald Trump, Kim Jong-un, Ali Khamenei, Vladimir Putin, and Xi Jinping.

The news article discusses a recent statement made by Donald Trump in which he accused Pakistan of providing safe haven to terrorists and threatened to cut off aid to the country. The article also discusses the response of the Pakistani government to Trump's statement, as well as the views of some analysts on the relationship between the United States and Pakistan.

The image and the news article are related in that they both discuss the issue of world peace and the role of certain world leaders in promoting or threatening it. However, the image does not specifically depict any of the events discussed in the article, and the article does not specifically mention the survey results shown in the image. Therefore, the relationship between the image and the news events set is complementary.

News article:
Topic: Security Region: Americas Blog Brand: The Skeptics Tags: Donald TrumpAmerica FirstMAGAGovernmentPolicy The president has the option to shake up American foreign policy for the better this year. The Bible tells us that not even a sparrow “will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father.” Washington officials long have considered themselves the equivalent of God, at least in this regard. Nothing on earth, in any other country, at any moment, is supposed to happen without America’s consent. That’s how U.S. foreign policy looks, anyway. Candidate Donald Trump talked like he would change that. Unfortunately, the officials with whom he has surrounded himself as president have done their best to stifle his natural impulses. Indeed, the National Security Strategy obviously was written by someone different than the president who gave the talk announcing the NSS’s release. Even so, lately he has been taking some of the right steps, such as cutting aid to Pakistan and the Palestinian Authority, though sometimes for the wrong reasons. With a new year dawning the president has an opportunity to toss off establishment shackles, so to speak, and push his own approach. In many cases all he needs do is pick up policies which he once advanced, before his appointees neutered him, ignoring him with his tweets while draining “America First” of meaning. Consider a few possibilities. Talk to North Korea’s Kim Jong-un The president once said that he would be “honored” to meet the North’s Supreme Leader. A meeting (with or without honor) is less important that engaging the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The reasons are many. War would be catastrophic. Talking would lower the temperature and reduce Kim’s fear that the United States was ready to strike. There is no evidence that Kim is suicidal, but if he believed America was preparing to attack, it would be in his interest to strike first, preempting U.S. action. Moreover, negotiation might reveal intermediate positions that both are achievable and better than the status quo, meaning the DPRK’s unrestrained expansion of its nuclear arsenal. For instance, a freeze at current levels backed by intrusive inspections. Better for America and the world to face North Korea with twenty or thirty nukes than an expanding arsenal of, say, 100. Would Pyongyang ever agree and comply? It’s impossible to know without trying. Abandon Attempts to Micromanage Syria The civil war which engulfed Syria was tragic but never warranted American involvement. Damascus was a Soviet ally throughout the Cold War, always hostile to the U.S. and Israel. But it posed no security threat to America. The probability of Washington creating a democratic, moderate, pro-American state was even lower than that of doing so in Iraq. Indeed, during the campaign President Trump appeared to recognize the foolishness of the Obama administration’s attempt to micromanage the multisided struggle. Washington simultaneously sought to oust Bashar al-Assad, who was fighting ISIS; empower the supposed “moderates,” who usually lost and surrendered to more radical insurgents; defeat ISIS, which ultimately grew out of the insurgency spawned by America’s invasion of Iraq; aid jihadist groups, including ones linked to Al Qaeda; work with Kurdish groups as well as Turkey, which feared them far more than ISIS; minimize the influence of neighboring Iran, ally of Assad and enemy of ISIS; and counteract Russian intervention, focused on the single goal of bolstering Assad. Implementing this policy were officials who had been bungling U.S. foreign policy for years. At least Washington succeeded in the essential task of destroying the Islamic State’s “caliphate.” The rest should be left up to the Syrians and their neighbors. Not even the winners have won much: Assad and his Iranian and Russian allies have weak control over only part of a nation which has been wrecked and, like Humpty Dumpty, probably cannot be put back together. In any case, it will take years for Syria to recover. Let the Saudis spend a bit of the money fleeced from imprisoned billionaires to help rebuild the homes of brother Arabs instead of purchase more chalets and yachts. Exit the Yemen War By pressing Riyadh to end its blockade, President Trump appeared to recognize that intervention in Yemen’s endless civil war has been a humanitarian horror. It also is a practical disaster. By attacking a rebel alliance to reinstate a puppet regime Saudi Arabia turned a local conflict into a sectarian struggle and gave Iran a low-cost means of bleeding the Saudi royals. No doubt, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (and his “coalition” partners, mostly the United Arab Emirates) expected a quick victory in Yemen. Instead, he ended up demonstrating the Saudi military’s inadequacy, exposing his militaristic ambitions, trashing his nation’s already poor reputation abroad, and giving Tehran an easy target. It will be difficult for Riyadh to withdraw, but Washington should leave that problem to the man who would be king—literally. The United States should end refueling and targeting assistance and cut off sale of munitions used to kill Yemeni civilians. Yemen is Saudi Arabia’s war. Negotiate a Better Relationship with Russia President Trump’s well-founded desire to improve relations with Russia has been overshadowed by charges that Moscow meddled in America’s election (just like Washington has done in numerous other nations’ contests.) Most Americans have noticed that Vladimir Putin is not a nice fellow. But there’s no evidence that he’s suicidal. He doesn’t want war with America. Nor is there any evidence that he’s planning an improbable attack on Europe, which has around ten times the economic strength and three times the population of Russia. The dangerous posturing by both sides grows out of the Ukraine conflict. Moscow is in the wrong, but the West’s hands are very dirty: expanding NATO to Russia’s border after promising not to do so, dismantling Moscow’s historic Serbian ally, planning to induct Georgia and Ukraine into NATO, using the European Union to pull Kiev away from Russia economically, and supporting a street putsch against an elected—if flawed—president who leaned toward Moscow. One can imagine how Washington politicians would have responded if Russia employed similar tactics in Mexico. Ukraine is in a bad neighborhood, but matters not for America’s security. Alliances should be used to provide security to the United States, not welfare to others. Washington still should seek to end the conflict for humanitarian reasons, but nothing involving Kiev is worth a conflict with Russia. Washington should propose a compromise. The United States should drop plans for lethal military aid to Kiev. NATO should pledge not to include Georgia and Ukraine, which actually would make the Western powers less secure by inducting those two nations’ conflicts with Moscow. Russia should end its support for Ukrainian separatists. Kiev should enact and implement greater local autonomy. While formally refusing to accept Moscow’s annexation of Crimea, the U.S. and European governments should recognize that nothing absent military defeat will reverse the move. The West then should lift sanctions on Russia. Washington as well as Moscow loses from an endless and purposeless new Cold War. Expect Allies to Defend Themselves While running for office candidate Trump pointed out how America’s supposed friends never seemed to wean themselves from military dependence on the United States. Of course, the real problem is Washington, which doesn’t want its allies to be independent. While American elites enjoy the illusion of running the world, average folks pay the bill. Since taking office, the president has periodically reiterated these complaints, but his national security team has defended America’s defense commitments to Europe, South Korea, Japan and Saudi Arabia. The president should take charge. He need not tell friendly states what to spend, only that the United States will do less. Why should prosperous and populous Europe tremble in fear of Russia? The Republic of Korea has an astonishing forty-five times the GDP of its northern antagonist, as well as twice the population. Why does America have to deploy troops to defend what amount to international welfare queens? The Cold War created a unique circumstance requiring an oversize U.S. military role. But that world has passed away. So should Washington’s outsize commitment to allies capable of defending themselves. America should remain engaged, but act primarily as emergency support against a hegemonic threat beyond the defense capabilities of friendly states. The only region where that seems plausible in practice today is Asia, and even there U.S. allies could do much more to handle day-to-day threats, even if still looking to America in an outsize crisis. Reconsider Nuclear Proliferation Among America’s Allies There is good reason to oppose the spread of nuclear weapons. But when proliferation occurs anyway the United States should consider whether it would be better for Washington’s allies to build countervailing weapons than for America to risk its homeland to guarantee the security of other states. In fact, President Trump once raised the possibility of South Korea and Japan building nuclear weapons. While that idea is controversial in Tokyo, two-thirds of South Koreans support creating their own deterrent. Of course, the usual suspects, including, it seems, the president’s own appointees, were horrified by the idea and reflexively clutched their pearls. While everyone agrees that it would be best if the North did not possess nuclear weapons, no one knows how to stop Pyongyang. If the DPRK gains the ability to hit the American homeland will any U.S. president be prepared to go to war on behalf of South Korea? If North Korea was losing, it would have no reason not to launch, or at least to threaten to do so if Washington did not withdraw. Why not exit Northeast Asia, where only the bad guys—China, Russia and the North—have nuclear weapons, and encourage America’s democratic allies to build their own?

Topic: Security Region: Americas Blog Brand: The Skeptics Tags: Donald TrumpAmerica FirstMAGAGovernmentPolicy The president has the option to shake up American foreign policy for the better this year. The Bible tells us that not even a sparrow “will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father.” Washington officials long have considered themselves the equivalent of God, at least in this regard. Nothing on earth, in any other country, at any moment, is supposed to happen without America’s consent. That’s how U.S. foreign policy looks, anyway. Candidate Donald Trump talked like he would change that. Unfortunately, the officials with whom he has surrounded himself as president have done their best to stifle his natural impulses. Indeed, the National Security Strategy obviously was written by someone different than the president who gave the talk announcing the NSS’s release. Even so, lately he has been taking some of the right steps, such as cutting aid to Pakistan and the Palestinian Authority, though sometimes for the wrong reasons. With a new year dawning the president has an opportunity to toss off establishment shackles, so to speak, and push his own approach. In many cases all he needs do is pick up policies which he once advanced, before his appointees neutered him, ignoring him with his tweets while draining “America First” of meaning. Consider a few possibilities. Talk to North Korea’s Kim Jong-un The president once said that he would be “honored” to meet the North’s Supreme Leader. A meeting (with or without honor) is less important that engaging the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The reasons are many. War would be catastrophic. Talking would lower the temperature and reduce Kim’s fear that the United States was ready to strike. There is no evidence that Kim is suicidal, but if he believed America was preparing to attack, it would be in his interest to strike first, preempting U.S. action. Moreover, negotiation might reveal intermediate positions that both are achievable and better than the status quo, meaning the DPRK’s unrestrained expansion of its nuclear arsenal. For instance, a freeze at current levels backed by intrusive inspections. Better for America and the world to face North Korea with twenty or thirty nukes than an expanding arsenal of, say, 100. Would Pyongyang ever agree and comply? It’s impossible to know without trying.

News article:
For years people around the world glued every four years to their televisions sets, (nowadays of course to their more advanced electronic devices) to follow all the news about the presidential elections in the US. As if the Americans were in the process of electing not solely a new occupant for the Oval Office in the White House, but a world leader!Many of the audience in different parts of the globe, for instance, under the influence of Western mainstream media, tended to be mesmerized by all the pageantry surrounding Barack Obama's inauguration on January 20, 2009; an African-American had become the US president to ensure a victory for African-Americans while the event itself was a symbol, so to speak, representing a 'change' in US oppressive approaches at least towards Black Americans something soon sank into collective unconscious of the global audience that there is a real change in the policies of the so-called 'nation of nations'.But in reality and away from the positive and pleasant aura surrounding Obama's election, both in the 'letter and spirit', the world saw no significant change in the overall polices of the United States, both domestically and internationally. The evidence: Obama administration's deafening silence on many world issues, including the terrorism mainly sponsored by US allies in the region, and of course the killing of hundreds of people in US 'overseas' drone operations.Now, one year after replacing Obama, Donald Trump is in the office; a controversial businessman whose election astound many, both in the US and outside.But, unlike Obama, Trump's rhetoric and pledges both on the campaign trail and after inaugurating on January 20, 2017 as the 45th President of the United States have created a negative aura based on a quite different letter and spirit; something still lingering over both the US and the world.The indecent literature Trump has been using in his Twitter posts in the first year of his presidency to react to global events and announcing new policies, have raised many eyebrows, even prompting some to repeat claims similar to those made soon after he launched his campaign, that the new president of the so-called nation of nations, was mentally sick.The promises and attempts made by the US president in the first year of his presidency have been increasingly encouraging the idea that he has some sort of mental problem.Trump's pledge to rip up the July 2015 Iran nuclear deal is an example. He and his administration during the past year have been trying to decertify the Iran Deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), despite all the efforts by the international community to address the issue of the country's peaceful nuclear activities and ward off a crisis that many believed had it started, it could have spilled over into all the whole region.He and his administration so far has not been able to sink the Iran Deal, though, mostly as result of other parties involved in the deal who want the landmark accord to be maintained.But Trump has gone on with his plan to decertify the JCPOA by referring the case to the Congress, and threatening to unilaterally withdraw from the deal.'In the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated,' Trump said, adding that American participation 'can be canceled by me, as president, at any time'.'I can do that instantaneously,' he said.One wonders what kind of logic is behind Trump's decision to sink the Iran Deal, better to say, to undermine a peaceful process.The US decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change is another example.While the countries are working together to stop global warming and save our planet Earth, the United States which is among industrial nations responsible for producing much of the greenhouse gases, suddenly decided to renege on a lifesaving global pact initially agreed to by all 195 countries present at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in December of that year.'The Paris accord will undermine (the US) economy,' and 'puts (the US) at a permanent disadvantage,' Trump said, failing to take into account that the US is the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, of course along with China, a country with a population about four times that of the US.Too, in case of terrorism, the new US president has repeatedly behaved inappropriately and illogically, especially when we consider his trip to Saudi Arabia.Two weeks after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the US soil, the Federal Bureau of Investigation connected the hijackers to al-Qaeda, a terrorist organization founded in 1988 by Osama bin Laden who was a wealthy man from a Saudi family.Washington never published the findings of the Joint Congressional Inquiry into the 9/11 attacks which killed 3,000 people and injured more than 6,000 others.

News article:
For years people around the world glued every four years to their televisions sets, (nowadays of course to their more advanced electronic devices) to follow all the news about the presidential elections in the US. As if the Americans were in the process of electing not solely a new occupant for the Oval Office in the White House, but a world leader!Many of the audience in different parts of the globe, for instance, under the influence of Western mainstream media, tended to be mesmerized by all the pageantry surrounding Barack Obama's inauguration on January 20, 2009; an African-American had become the US president to ensure a victory for African-Americans while the event itself was a symbol, so to speak, representing a 'change' in US oppressive approaches at least towards Black Americans something soon sank into collective unconscious of the global audience that there is a real change in the policies of the so-called 'nation of nations'.But in reality and away from the positive and pleasant aura surrounding Obama's election, both in the 'letter and spirit', the world saw no significant change in the overall polices of the United States, both domestically and internationally. The evidence: Obama administration's deafening silence on many world issues, including the terrorism mainly sponsored by US allies in the region, and of course the killing of hundreds of people in US 'overseas' drone operations.Now, one year after replacing Obama, Donald Trump is in the office; a controversial businessman whose election astound many, both in the US and outside.But, unlike Obama, Trump's rhetoric and pledges both on the campaign trail and after inaugurating on January 20, 2017 as the 45th President of the United States have created a negative aura based on a quite different letter and spirit; something still lingering over both the US and the world.The indecent literature Trump has been using in his Twitter posts in the first year of his presidency to react to global events and announcing new policies, have raised many eyebrows, even prompting some to repeat claims similar to those made soon after he launched his campaign, that the new president of the so-called nation of nations, was mentally sick.The promises and attempts made by the US president in the first year of his presidency have been increasingly encouraging the idea that he has some sort of mental problem.Trump's pledge to rip up the July 2015 Iran nuclear deal is an example. He and his administration during the past year have been trying to decertify the Iran Deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), despite all the efforts by the international community to address the issue of the country's peaceful nuclear activities and ward off a crisis that many believed had it started, it could have spilled over into all the whole region.He and his administration so far has not been able to sink the Iran Deal, though, mostly as result of other parties involved in the deal who want the landmark accord to be maintained.But Trump has gone on with his plan to decertify the JCPOA by referring the case to the Congress, and threatening to unilaterally withdraw from the deal.'In the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated,' Trump said, adding that American participation 'can be canceled by me, as president, at any time'.'I can do that instantaneously,' he said.One wonders what kind of logic is behind Trump's decision to sink the Iran Deal, better to say, to undermine a peaceful process.The US decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change is another example.While the countries are working together to stop global warming and save our planet Earth, the United States which is among industrial nations responsible for producing much of the greenhouse gases, suddenly decided to renege on a lifesaving global pact initially agreed to by all 195 countries present at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in December of that year.'The Paris accord will undermine (the US) economy,' and 'puts (the US) at a permanent disadvantage,' Trump said, failing to take into account that the US is the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, of course along with China, a country with a population about four times that of the US.Too, in case of terrorism, the new US president has repeatedly behaved inappropriately and illogically, especially when we consider his trip to Saudi Arabia.Two weeks after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the US soil, the Federal Bureau of Investigation connected the hijackers to al-Qaeda, a terrorist organization founded in 1988 by Osama bin Laden who was a wealthy man from a Saudi family.Washington never published the findings of the Joint Congressional Inquiry into the 9/11 attacks which killed 3,000 people and injured more than 6,000 others. This is while, there are claims suggesting attempts by Riyadh to keep hidden their alleged role in the terrorist attacks.But to the surprise of all the anti-terror activists and countries in the frontline of fighting terrorism, Trump chose Saudi Arabia his first foreign visit and joyfully participated in a sword dance with Saudi rulers.Again the million-dollar question is that why he traveled to Saudi Arabia, a country whose hidden hand was, and still is, instrumental in propping up terrorist organizations in the region.Trump also raised hackles in London in September 2017, commenting on the terrorist attack on the British capital, when said in a tweet that the terrorists were in the sights of the police in the country.'Another attack in London by a loser terrorist.

News article:
At a first glance, the recent recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital by US President Donald Trump looks like an empty gesture, if not an irrational and unwanted declaration, which fomented violence. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Russia recognized west Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and east Jerusalem as a Palestinian capital, before Trump’s announcement. Trump did not move the US embassy in Tel Aviv, and in fact gave nothing to Israel, other than increased Palestinian rioting, after being warned not to go ahead with this announcement. Israel’s gains are nowhere to be seen. This, at least is according to the Western utility-based view, which weighs all steps by their costs and gains. Yet there are more successful ways of viewing such developments. The Russian strategic thinking, for example, does not focus on end state production logic, which dominates Western thinking. In the Western mindset, there is no room for emerging phenomena. Russian thinking, by contrast, is non-linear and non-predictive. Western decision makers look at events that ‘veer off course’ as accidents that need to be fixed and studied, much like engineers investigating why a rocket blew up at the launch stage. Yet rocket engineering takes place in a closed system, while strategy is an open system—a fact that Trump understands, due to this business background. The economy is also an open system. Strategy is based on the assumption of marching into the unknown. Instead of setting a main purpose and then calculating all steps from start to finish in line with the goal of reaching it, the correct path is to realize that in strategy, one operates in a changing environment. Planning every stage, step by step, leaves no ability to respond to changes. Instead, taking a step and then stopping to see what has changed, before reassessing and moving again, is the correct approach. This is the Russian doctrine. It still rests on an end vision, but lacks a start-to-finish plan on how to get there. Action is designed to deliver shocks to the system, causing it to reorganize itself. On this basis, a new system is created, which is then studied. A chain of campaigns follows. Russia’s approach is to create friction, to become a part of the eco system, and then influence the rearrangement of the system. Trump's calculated jolt Trump appears to be thinking in a similar way. He has abandoned the idea of pursuing the same dead end peace plans promoted by his predecessors, US Presidents Barack Obama, George Bush, and Bill Clinton. Instead, he sought to shake up the system in a highly calculated manner, and march into the unknown. Yet Trump did not jump over a cliff. He left one stable leg on the ground. Trump did not explicitly abandon the two-state solution, nor did he recognize Israel’s presence in Judea and Samaria. Trump, in essence, realized that the current situation is leading nowhere, and threw a rock into the water to muddy it and see how the system would rearrange itself. He left himself an exit point, saying he was merely recognizing what de facto already exists in Jerusalem—Israel’s parliament, high court, and the seat of government. This delivered a shock to the system, which is currently responding. The way in which events unfold can form a basis for the next step. President Trump and President Abbas (Photo: Reuters) This is similar to a military tactic seeking to get an enemy to give up its position, by sending a forward reconnaissance unit, provoking enemy fire, and mapping out its position. As a result of Trump’s declaration, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan held a conference with Jordan’s King Abdullah and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to push back against Trump—yet Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi attempted to stop Abbas and Abdullah from attending, underlining a crack. The Palestinian Authority and Hamas are each responding to the declaration, and the Palestinian arena is united on this issue at least, that any scenario that does not include Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine is intolerable. The Israeli interest Ultimately, these events serve Israel’s interests of maintaining a united Jerusalem—a need that was recognized by former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who declared this in a speech to the Knesset in 1995 prior to his assassination. Rabin’s goal was to provide Israel with stability, which the Palestinian Authority was designed to provide. Only later, from the time of the 2000 Barak - Clinton proposals onward, did the idea of splitting Jerusalem appear as an Israeli government position. Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak’s offer was repeated by the ex premier Ehud Olmert, and Abbas demanded that the next Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, use Olmert’s offer as the starting point of future negotiations. Netanyahu has rejected this demand. President Trump and PM Netanyahu (Photo: Reuters) Trump understood what his predecessors did not. After the mass terrorism of the second intifada, and the conversion of Gaza into an enemy Hamas territory after Israel’s withdrawal from it, Israeli society no longer believes in the idea of giving land for stability, or in the ability of the US to supervise and guard this stability. Trump therefore proceeded with a recognition of Jerusalem, assisting Israel’s position, which holds that even if a Palestinian state is formed, it will not be based on the Barak - Olmert parameters of dividing Jerusalem. By doing so, he closed the door to future blackmail and demands from the Palestinian side, which is welcome news indeed for Israel.

The Palestinian Authority and Hamas are each responding to the declaration, and the Palestinian arena is united on this issue at least, that any scenario that does not include Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine is intolerable. The Israeli interest Ultimately, these events serve Israel’s interests of maintaining a united Jerusalem—a need that was recognized by former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who declared this in a speech to the Knesset in 1995 prior to his assassination. Rabin’s goal was to provide Israel with stability, which the Palestinian Authority was designed to provide. Only later, from the time of the 2000 Barak - Clinton proposals onward, did the idea of splitting Jerusalem appear as an Israeli government position. Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak’s offer was repeated by the ex premier Ehud Olmert, and Abbas demanded that the next Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, use Olmert’s offer as the starting point of future negotiations. Netanyahu has rejected this demand. President Trump and PM Netanyahu (Photo: Reuters) Trump understood what his predecessors did not. After the mass terrorism of the second intifada, and the conversion of Gaza into an enemy Hamas territory after Israel’s withdrawal from it, Israeli society no longer believes in the idea of giving land for stability, or in the ability of the US to supervise and guard this stability. Trump therefore proceeded with a recognition of Jerusalem, assisting Israel’s position, which holds that even if a Palestinian state is formed, it will not be based on the Barak - Olmert parameters of dividing Jerusalem. By doing so, he closed the door to future blackmail and demands from the Palestinian side, which is welcome news indeed for Israel.

News article:
At a first glance, the recent recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital by US President Donald Trump looks like an empty gesture, if not an irrational and unwanted declaration, which fomented violence. Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter Russia recognized west Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and east Jerusalem as a Palestinian capital, before Trump’s announcement. Trump did not move the US embassy in Tel Aviv, and in fact gave nothing to Israel, other than increased Palestinian rioting, after being warned not to go ahead with this announcement. Israel’s gains are nowhere to be seen. This, at least is according to the Western utility-based view, which weighs all steps by their costs and gains. Yet there are more successful ways of viewing such developments. The Russian strategic thinking, for example, does not focus on end state production logic, which dominates Western thinking. In the Western mindset, there is no room for emerging phenomena. Russian thinking, by contrast, is non-linear and non-predictive. Western decision makers look at events that ‘veer off course’ as accidents that need to be fixed and studied, much like engineers investigating why a rocket blew up at the launch stage. Yet rocket engineering takes place in a closed system, while strategy is an open system—a fact that Trump understands, due to this business background. The economy is also an open system. Strategy is based on the assumption of marching into the unknown. Instead of setting a main purpose and then calculating all steps from start to finish in line with the goal of reaching it, the correct path is to realize that in strategy, one operates in a changing environment. Planning every stage, step by step, leaves no ability to respond to changes. Instead, taking a step and then stopping to see what has changed, before reassessing and moving again, is the correct approach. This is the Russian doctrine. It still rests on an end vision, but lacks a start-to-finish plan on how to get there. Action is designed to deliver shocks to the system, causing it to reorganize itself. On this basis, a new system is created, which is then studied. A chain of campaigns follows. Russia’s approach is to create friction, to become a part of the eco system, and then influence the rearrangement of the system. Trump's calculated jolt Trump appears to be thinking in a similar way. He has abandoned the idea of pursuing the same dead end peace plans promoted by his predecessors, US Presidents Barack Obama, George Bush, and Bill Clinton. Instead, he sought to shake up the system in a highly calculated manner, and march into the unknown. Yet Trump did not jump over a cliff. He left one stable leg on the ground. Trump did not explicitly abandon the two-state solution, nor did he recognize Israel’s presence in Judea and Samaria. Trump, in essence, realized that the current situation is leading nowhere, and threw a rock into the water to muddy it and see how the system would rearrange itself. He left himself an exit point, saying he was merely recognizing what de facto already exists in Jerusalem—Israel’s parliament, high court, and the seat of government. This delivered a shock to the system, which is currently responding. The way in which events unfold can form a basis for the next step. President Trump and President Abbas (Photo: Reuters) This is similar to a military tactic seeking to get an enemy to give up its position, by sending a forward reconnaissance unit, provoking enemy fire, and mapping out its position. As a result of Trump’s declaration, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan held a conference with Jordan’s King Abdullah and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to push back against Trump—yet Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi attempted to stop Abbas and Abdullah from attending, underlining a crack.

The row over Trump's 'racist' comments about allowing 's***hole countries' is another chapter in the president's difficult relationship with the United Nations. In December, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley blasted member states who overwhelmingly backed a proposal condemning the US for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and pledging to move its embassy there. The vote was 128–9, with 35 abstentions. Only Guatemala, Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo joined the United States and Israel in opposing the measure. Another 21 countries didn't show up to vote. US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley blasted countries that condemned the US for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital American ambassador Nikki Haley blasted anti-Israel member nations during a pre-vote debate, warning that there would be a price to pay for standing in President Donald Trump's way. 'This vote will be remembered,' she said as the entire UN General Assembly looked on. 'America will put our embassy in Jerusalem. That is what the American people want us to do. And it is the right thing to do. No vote in the United Nations will make any difference on that,' Haley lectured from the central podium. 'But this vote will make a difference on how Americans look at the UN and on how we look at countries who disrespect us in the UN.' Back in September, in Trump's first speech to the UN, he drew a round of applause after attacking Iran, North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela. He called Iran a 'rogue state' for its supposed nuclear ambitions as he criticized the nuclear deal struck by Iran and the Obama administration. 'We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles. And we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program,' Trump said, drawing applause from leaders of more than 180 nations in the room. 'The Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States and I don't think you've heard the last of it, believe me,' he said. 'It's time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction.'

News article:
Washington – Trust in U.S. institutions, particularly the government, has plunged in President Donald Trump’s first year in office, according to a leading survey released on the eve of the World Economic Forum in Davos. The annual Edelman Trust Barometer showed overall trust in the four institutions it measures – the government, media, business and non-governmental organizations – falling more steeply in the United States than in any of the 28 countries surveyed. Trump has broken with presidential tradition and repeatedly denounced the media and judiciary – attacks his critics say risk undermining public confidence in those institutions. By contrast, the country that saw the biggest trust gains among its own citizens was China, after a year in which President Xi Jinping cemented his hold on power at a triumphal party congress. Faith in the Chinese government jumped 8 points to 84 percent. In the United States it fell 14 points to 33 percent. “The United States is enduring an unprecedented crisis of trust,” said Richard Edelman, head of the communications marketing firm that commissioned the research. Xi was the headliner in Davos last year, days before Trump was inaugurated. This year, Trump is the main attraction. He is expected to defend his “America First” policies in a speech on the final day of the conference of policymakers, CEOs, bankers and celebrities in the Swiss Alps, which runs from Jan. 23-26. Pointing to the steep erosion in trust in the United States, Edelman said it was the first time since the survey began 18 years ago that such a precipitous drop was not linked to a specific event, such as an economic crisis or catastrophe, like the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. Instead it comes at a time when the U.S. economy is showing robust growth and stock markets are at record highs. “Normally when things are going well, trust is pretty good,” Edelman said. “Increasingly there is a disconnect between trust and economic outcomes.” FAKE NEWS He attributed this to a politicisation of the public discourse in the United States and elsewhere that has left many people confused about what is fact and what is fiction. The survey showed nearly 2 in 3 people are unable to distinguish reliable news from rumors and falsehoods. While trust in journalism rose to its highest level in years, faith in search engines and social media platforms like Google, Twitter and Facebook fell in 21 of the 28 countries, making media the least trusted of the four institutions globally. The Edelman survey, based on the opinions of over 33,000 people and conducted between Oct. 28 and Nov. 20 of last year, showed an even deeper lack of trust in U.S. institutions among the “informed public” – people who are college educated, earn above-average incomes and consume news regularly. Among this group, trust declined a whopping 23 points, putting the United States in last place among the 28 countries surveyed, below Russia and South Africa. In 2017 it ranked sixth. In the broader U.S. population, faith in the government was equally low among respondents who said they voted for Trump and those who supported his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. But trust in the media was significantly higher among Clinton backers. The survey also showed that Americans’ trust in their own companies fell more steeply than in any other country, with Switzerland and Canada registering the highest levels of trust in their homegrown brands. It showed a revival of faith in “experts”, including academics and businessmen.

News article:
Only one year after Donald Trump was inaugurated, the US has already suffered an alarming setback to its global leadership role. In short order, Trump managed to bewilder our friends and allies, intensify the enmity between us and our foes, and evoke fear, concerns and unpredictability in the international community. I cannot imagine how much further America’s reputation will decline as an increasing number of countries, including our allies, have resigned themselves to the lack of American leadership under Trump’s watch, which will have major adverse repercussions on our national interests, and influence the world over. Trump’s “America First” notion, his abandonment of our soft power, and his reckless utterances have deeply troubled countries with strong ties to the US; enraged those who have been maligned by his reprehensible rhetoric; and delighted our adversaries, while leaving America increasingly isolated. On the issue of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and anti-ballistic missiles, instead of engaging Pyongyang in quiet diplomacy to resolve the conflict, he resorted to bellicose rhetoric and threats that only heightened tensions and brought the US and North Korea ever closer to the unthinkable — nuclear war. Since then, Trump’s comments have been chaotic — sometimes remaining bellicose, other times signaling he will indeed work diplomatically with Kim Jong-un. Related coverage Palestinian Children Wear Necklaces with Pictures of Their Dead Terrorist ‘Role Models’ The latest trend in the Palestinian Authority (PA) is a new kind of jewelry: Necklace-amulets with pictures of terrorist “Martyrs”... On the Iran deal, rather than trying to peacefully negotiate any changes, especially to the sunset provisions, Trump decertified the deal and threatened to impose new sanctions, which would torpedo the deal completely. He demanded that Congress modify the deal, even though the other five signatories to the accord vehemently reject any tampering of the deal because of Iran’s continued full adherence. Tehran rejects any changes, and threatened to withdraw from the deal and resume its nuclear program, which could lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and subject the region’s inhabitants to living in the shadows of nuclear conflagration. And rather than take action himself against the deal, Trump simply punted to Congress. On immigration, Trump’s racist attitude toward Muslims and people of color has severely undermined America’s unique image as a country of immigrants, which made America great in the first place. His reference to Africa, Haiti and El Salvador as “shithole” countries provoked unprecedented international outrage. Scores of American ambassadors around the world were summoned to explain the inexplicable statement. Why would a sitting US president utter such filth, in the White House no less? Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney put it succinctly when he said: “What he [Trump] communicated caused racists to rejoice, minorities to weep, and the vast heart of America to mourn.” As to international treaties and accords, Trump has completely disregarded our commitment to live up to such agreements. He insists on renegotiating the terms of NAFTA, and effectively withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (connecting the Americas with Asia and Australia). He pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord and withdrew from the United Nations Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). As a result, he acutely damaged America’s credibility, making many countries wary of entering into bilateral agreements with the US, as they can no longer trust his administration to live up to our commitments. This leaves a wide opening for our adversaries to fill the vacuum that Trump has created. Trump has further shocked all democracies around the world with his incessant assault on the press. Though a few of his predecessors have occasionally ostracized the press, none has mounted such vile criticism. He accuses all media outlets (except for Fox News) of being the “enemy” of the people, claiming they are biased and spreading “fake news” to purposefully malign him and deride his policy initiatives. Sadly, whereas America was once seen as the beacon of freedom and democracy to be emulated, Trump is consciously undermining one of our central constitutional pillars — the free press — to the utter consternation of democracies around the world. On the question of the US’ reliability, many countries who depend on America for their national security are worried about Trump’s commitment to safeguarding their security. Trump’s criticism of NATO, which is the core of West European security, and his appeasement of Russia, which is as the West’s staunchest enemy, raises questions as to where he would stand if Europe was threatened. This concern is being expressed by our allies. For example, Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her misgivings, stating that: “The times when we could fully rely on others have passed us by a bit. … [W]e Europeans must really take our destiny into our own hands. … We have to know that we must fight for our future on our own, for our destiny as Europeans.” The fact that Trump lies as often as he breathes also deeply troubles countries around the world — because they can no longer take his word for granted on issues of major importance. Trump seems to be totally oblivious to the reality that without American global leadership, the world will be even more chaotic than it is today. Trump has no end-strategy for Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan (he has ceded many of these places to Russia, Iran and terrorists). He also lacks focus or interest in stemming the widespread, destabilizing violent conflicts and human rights abuses around the world. The Republican Party has become complicit in Trump’s mischiefs and misguided policies. It is now up to the Democrats to get their act together, regain control of the House and Senate, and shackle Trump before he causes irreparable damage to America’s global role and responsibility.

News article:
Only one year after Donald Trump was inaugurated, the US has already suffered an alarming setback to its global leadership role. In short order, Trump managed to bewilder our friends and allies, intensify the enmity between us and our foes, and evoke fear, concerns and unpredictability in the international community. I cannot imagine how much further America’s reputation will decline as an increasing number of countries, including our allies, have resigned themselves to the lack of American leadership under Trump’s watch, which will have major adverse repercussions on our national interests, and influence the world over. Trump’s “America First” notion, his abandonment of our soft power, and his reckless utterances have deeply troubled countries with strong ties to the US; enraged those who have been maligned by his reprehensible rhetoric; and delighted our adversaries, while leaving America increasingly isolated. On the issue of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and anti-ballistic missiles, instead of engaging Pyongyang in quiet diplomacy to resolve the conflict, he resorted to bellicose rhetoric and threats that only heightened tensions and brought the US and North Korea ever closer to the unthinkable — nuclear war. Since then, Trump’s comments have been chaotic — sometimes remaining bellicose, other times signaling he will indeed work diplomatically with Kim Jong-un. Related coverage Palestinian Children Wear Necklaces with Pictures of Their Dead Terrorist ‘Role Models’ The latest trend in the Palestinian Authority (PA) is a new kind of jewelry: Necklace-amulets with pictures of terrorist “Martyrs”... On the Iran deal, rather than trying to peacefully negotiate any changes, especially to the sunset provisions, Trump decertified the deal and threatened to impose new sanctions, which would torpedo the deal completely. He demanded that Congress modify the deal, even though the other five signatories to the accord vehemently reject any tampering of the deal because of Iran’s continued full adherence. Tehran rejects any changes, and threatened to withdraw from the deal and resume its nuclear program, which could lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and subject the region’s inhabitants to living in the shadows of nuclear conflagration. And rather than take action himself against the deal, Trump simply punted to Congress. On immigration, Trump’s racist attitude toward Muslims and people of color has severely undermined America’s unique image as a country of immigrants, which made America great in the first place. His reference to Africa, Haiti and El Salvador as “shithole” countries provoked unprecedented international outrage. Scores of American ambassadors around the world were summoned to explain the inexplicable statement. Why would a sitting US president utter such filth, in the White House no less? Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney put it succinctly when he said: “What he [Trump] communicated caused racists to rejoice, minorities to weep, and the vast heart of America to mourn.” As to international treaties and accords, Trump has completely disregarded our commitment to live up to such agreements. He insists on renegotiating the terms of NAFTA, and effectively withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (connecting the Americas with Asia and Australia). He pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord and withdrew from the United Nations Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

Trump Comments Overshadow Annual Summit of African Leaders By Anita Powell January 26, 2018 Dozens of African leaders will convene in Ethiopia on January 28 for the annual summit of the African Union, with the official theme of combating corruption. But already, one man has taken the spotlight at the gathering – and he isn't even attending. U.S. President Donald Trump's incendiary comments about African nations – in which he allegedly used a profane term comparing them to toilets – has deeply resonated among the 55-member body, according to the AU's commission chairman, Moussa Faki Mahamat. "Africa has not yet finished digesting this shocking statement and the hatred and desire to marginalize and exclude Africa that it conveyed," he said. "Such a statement, coming after others by the Trump administration on Jerusalem and the reduction of U.S. funding for international peacekeeping operations, makes one think that multilateralism is in the midst of a grave crisis. The African continent cannot remain silent on this subject." Trump, for his part, denied making the comment during White House talks on immigration earlier this month. Rare words Such harsh words directed at a major ally are rare for the continental body, which makes decisions by consensus and prides itself on multilateralism. This is the second year that the U.S. leader has become a focus in an event meant for African nations to talk about reforming national institutions, restoring peace and improving the lives of some 1.2 billion people on the world's fastest-growing continent. Last year, delegates were upset over the Trump administration's announcement that people from certain countries would be banned from visiting the U.S., which initially targeted three AU member states: Libya, Somalia and Sudan. The ban has since been expanded to include the central African nation of Chad. AU analyst Liesl Luow-Vaudran spoke to VOA from Addis Ababa and said she expects to hear some pointed words against the U.S., but that the remarks are likely to be less vitriolic now that firebrand Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe has left office. Luow-Vaudran also said she does not expect the AU to pass any resolutions on the U.S. And that, she says, is a key weakness of the Addis Ababa-based institution: The AU is built on consensus, and getting 55 members to agree on sensitive issues is a challenge. For example, she says, while it's commendable that the continental body has chosen corruption as its theme this year, members have little power to enforce their resolutions, and are hesitant to make decisions that could be seen as trampling on the sovereignty of other nations. "The AU, for African citizens, has yet to show its relevance when it comes to, for example, intervening in peace and security issues and crises on the continent, which, to an extent, is the core business of the AU," she said. "It needs to intervene where no one else will and mediate in crises. ... But to a large extent, the AU is struggling, because it is such a big organization in terms of member states, but it's a small organization, in terms of capacity." When it comes to the U.S., it is clear the body doesn't speak as one: The AU's current head, Rwandan President Paul Kagame, smiled Friday as he met with Trump on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and discussed trade and cooperation. Neither man spoke about Trump's alleged comments on African countries when they met afterward with reporters. Luow-Vaudran notes, however, that for decades, the only non-African leaders allowed to speak at the opening ceremony – and again on the schedule this year – were Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, and members of the Arab League. More action? Elissa Jobson, AU relations adviser for the International Crisis Group, says she'd like to see more action from the AU. "What I'd like to see on the agenda would be some of the crucial peace and security issues: The [Democratic Republic of] Congo, South Sudan and Somalia, although I expect these will not be on the agenda," she told VOA. "I think we'll probably also see them tackling another crucial issue for the African Union, the institutional reforms that have been spearheaded by Paul Kagame." But that, she says, is the nature of meetings like this. "I think it's similar with a number of summits like this: the main sessions, the formal sessions, countries come with prepared speeches, they're not open to debate, it's a place to get your position across without really, sort of, getting into the details of the subjects that are on the agenda," she said. "So often, the real debate takes place on the sidelines, inside meetings, in bilateral meetings." NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address

News article:
Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-31 20:06:51|Editor: Lifang Video Player Close WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Donald Trump outlined his second-year agenda in his maiden State of the Union (SOTU) address on Tuesday night, focusing on infrastructure, immigration and national security. Despite the president's attempt to win bipartisan support, analysts say obstacles remain to cooperation between Republicans and Democrats. INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE Trump started his speech by touting the high stock markets and low unemployment in the past year under his presidency along with tax cuts as the foundation for what he claimed to be a "new American moment". After expressing expectations of "fair and reciprocal" trade relationships with others, Trump asked both parties in Congress to pass an infrastructure bill so as to create 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars of investment. He advocated using federal government funds as incentives to stimulate state and local government funds as well as private capital in infrastructure investment. In order to do so, Trump also called on lawmakers to streamline the approval process for infrastructure investment by shortening it to no more than two years. A statement released by the White House on Tuesday said the administration will also enhance its support for infrastructure projects in rural areas. Darrell West, a senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank Brookings Institution, told Xinhua that infrastructure might be the only possibility for bipartisanship. "That may be an area where the parties could come together because each side understands the need to rebuild bridges, highways and dams," West said. But Christopher Galdieri, assistant professor at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire, said "Trump is seeking too large a role for private partners for many Democrats to be comfortable." "There aren't the Republican votes to pass a plan like the one he sketched without Democratic votes," he said. IMMIGRATION OVERHAUL Immigration is one of the policy areas where the Trump administration would like to see legislative progress. During the nearly 90-minute speech, Trump said criminals, including MS-13, the international criminal gang, were taking advantage of "outdated immigration rules". The Republican president also tried to adopt a bipartisan tone on immigration overhaul, calling his proposal a fair compromise that should be supported by both parties. His remarks came after an impasse over the fate of nearly 1 million young illegal immigrants had led to a government shutdown earlier this month. Trump urged both parties to set politics aside and "finally get the job done," laying out his framework for immigration legislation that includes a path to citizenship for 2 million illegal immigrants and securing the border by building a wall on the southern border with Mexico. He also called for an end to the visa lottery and chain migration while adopting a merit-based immigration system in favor of applicants with skills needed by the country. Trump said those pillars "represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system." But he drew protests from Democratic lawmakers when detailing some of those proposals. West said it is hard to see how the two sides can do much in this area as the president still wants a wall, which the Democrats will not support. NATIONAL SECURITY Renewing one of his campaign promises, Trump urged lawmakers to end what he called a "dangerous defense sequester" and fully fund the U.S. military. Calling for efforts to modernize and rebuild the nuclear arsenal, Trump said while hopefully the U.S. would never have to use it, the arsenal would make it capable of deterring "any acts of aggression". In a reexamination of the military detention policy, Trump said he had signed an order to keep open the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, which was set up in 2002 as part of the U.S. war on terror. The president also pledged to continue the anti-terrorism fight until the Islamic State terrorist group was defeated, urging the Congress to ensure all necessary resources in the fight against terrorists. As for his foreign policy, Trump took a tough stance, calling Iran, Cuba, Venezuela and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea "adversaries". While urging the Congress to address the "fundamental flaws" in the Iran nuclear deal, he also defended his "maximum pressure" campaign against Pyongyang's nuclear development project.

News article:
Berlin – German Justice Minister Heiko Maas said there was no place for anti-Semitism in Germany after demonstrators angered by U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel burned Israeli flags in Berlin. Hundreds of people gathered outside the U.S. embassy in the German capital for “Day of Rage” protests on Friday. Police later said on Twitter that they had detained 10 people during the protest and 12 criminal charges had been brought — including for burning Israeli flags. Maas told Bild newspaper’s Monday edition: “Any kind of anti-Semitism is an attack on everyone. Anti-Semitism must never be allowed to have a place (in society) again.” Anti-Semitism remains a very sensitive issue in Germany more than 70 years after the end of the Nazi-era Holocaust, in which six million Jews were killed. Germany regards itself as one of Israel’s closest allies. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told Bild that while criticism of Trump’s decision was understandable, people had no right or reason to burn the Israeli flag, stir up hatred against Jews or question Israel’s right to exist. He said whoever did this nonetheless was “taking a stand not only against Israel but also against the German constitution” and Germany would not tolerate that. Gabriel said Germany only permitted peaceful demonstrations and would not allow conflicts in which people were prepared to use violence to be brought to Germany from other countries and played out here.

News article:
BERLIN, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The German government condemned on Monday the burning of Israeli flags and use of anti-Semitic slogans reported at protest rallies in Berlin and other cities after U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Government spokesman Steffen Seibert repeated Berlin's criticism of Trump's decision but said that did not justify anti-Semitic acts, adding that Germany had a historic responsibility to stand by Israel and all Jews everywhere. Anti-Semitism remains a very sensitive issue in Germany more than 70 years after the end of the Nazi-era Holocaust, in which six million Jews were killed. Germany regards itself as one of Israel's closest allies. "One must be ashamed when such open hatred of Jews is on display on the streets of German cities," Seibert told a regular government news conference. "Our laws on freedom of expresssion and assembly guarantee everyone a right to peaceful protest, but this right is no free pass for anti-Semitic atrocities, for incitement and violence," he said, calling for continual efforts to combat such incidents. Trump's decision last week to recognise Jerusalem as the Israeli capital reversed decades of U.S. policy and caused consternation across the Arab world and among Western allies. It has ignited "Day of Rage" street protests in the Palestinian territories and beyond. On Sunday, about 2,500 people demonstrated in Berlin against Trump's decision and one Israeli flag was burned, police said. They have launched investigations into 11 people, one of them related to the flag burning. On Friday hundreds of people had gathered outside the U.S. embassy in Berlin for "Day of Rage" protests. Police said they had detained 10 people during that protest and brought criminal charges against 12 people, including for burning Israeli flags. Additional "isolated" incidents have been reported in Munich and other German cities, Seibert said on Monday. A Justice Ministry spokesman said authorities would prosecute those responsible for the flag-burning incidents. Seibert also criticised comments made by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who referred to Israel over the weekend as a "terror state". "Basically, we see it as completely wrong, unacceptable and inappropriate to describe Israel in such a manner," he said. Other top German officials, including the foreign, justice and interior ministers, have condemned anti-Semitic acts and the burning of Israeli flags in interviews and on Twitter. A German foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday the country's ambassador to Kuwait had met Kuwaiti officials on Nov. 28 to discuss a separate issue that has raised concerns among Jewish groups about anti-Semitism. A German court ruled last month that Kuwait Airways had the right to refuse to carry an Israeli passenger due to his nationality, saying Germany's anti-discrimination law applies only in cases of discrimination on the basis of race, ethnic background or religion, not citizenship.

News article:
By setting symbols of Israel on fire in recent days, demonstrators have raised a legal issue. The burning of national symbols is not forbidden in all cases, although incitement to violence against Jewish people is. Germany's leading politicians have universally condemned the burning of Israeli flags and symbols in Berlin amidst recent demonstrations sparked by US President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. But are such acts actually illegal in Germany? "As to whether the burning of flags on Friday and Sunday can be prosecuted, that's a question for the prosecutor's office in Berlin," a spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said on Monday. "I can only draw attention to the fact that there is a passage in the criminal code, Paragraph 104, concerning damage to foreign countries' and other national symbols." Paragraph 104 reads: "Whosoever removes, destroys, damages, renders unrecognizable or insults by mischief a flag of a foreign state, which is displayed according to legal provisions or recognized custom, or a state symbol of such a state which has been publicly installed by a recognized mission of such state, shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding two years or a fine." But Berlin police say that this law did not apply to what happened in the city last week, when protesters burned at least two Israeli flags in front of the Brandenburg Gate on Friday. "Burning a flag is not a crime, whether it be Israeli or American or from any other nation" Berlin police spokesman Thomas Neuendorf explained to DW. "The only exception is, for instance, when a flag is taken from an official building like an embassy and burned." Burning any kind of objects is forbidden at demonstrations but is only a misdemeanor. Neuendorf said that 10 people were detained at demonstrations over the weekend for throwing bottles and comparable offenses. Demonstrators burned symbols of Israel, causing outrage among politicians Image: picture alliance/dpa/Jüdisches Forum für Demokratie und gegen Antisemitismus e.V. Not necessarily incitement Demonstrators were reported to have chanted anti-Semitic slogans, and Berlin's mayor Michael Müller has promised that further protests will be kept under close observation. Government spokesman Steffen Seibert said that anti-Semitism was not protected under German freedom of speech laws.

"But this is not a free pass for anti-Semitic excesses, for incitement and violence." But while protesters may have chanted "Israel, murderer of children," they did not necessarily violate Paragraph 130 of the German criminal code, which prohibits "incitement to hatred." "Individual people have to be insulted or threatened for there to be a case made for incitement to hatred," Neuendorf said. A hypothetical example of incitement, Neuendorf explained, would be if someone pointed to a Jewish man wearing a yarmulke and encouraged a crowd to do him harm. "Chants like 'Israel, murderer of children' are covered by freedom of speech," Neuendorf added. Because of Germany's past, statements and acts that can be interpreted as anti-Semitic will always be explosive in the country. But in the recent cases, Berlin police say they do not actually violate criminal law.

The image shows a group of people burning an Israeli flag, which is a symbol of Israel.

News article:
By setting symbols of Israel on fire in recent days, demonstrators have raised a legal issue. The burning of national symbols is not forbidden in all cases, although incitement to violence against Jewish people is. Germany's leading politicians have universally condemned the burning of Israeli flags and symbols in Berlin amidst recent demonstrations sparked by US President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. But are such acts actually illegal in Germany? "As to whether the burning of flags on Friday and Sunday can be prosecuted, that's a question for the prosecutor's office in Berlin," a spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said on Monday. "I can only draw attention to the fact that there is a passage in the criminal code, Paragraph 104, concerning damage to foreign countries' and other national symbols." Paragraph 104 reads: "Whosoever removes, destroys, damages, renders unrecognizable or insults by mischief a flag of a foreign state, which is displayed according to legal provisions or recognized custom, or a state symbol of such a state which has been publicly installed by a recognized mission of such state, shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding two years or a fine." But Berlin police say that this law did not apply to what happened in the city last week, when protesters burned at least two Israeli flags in front of the Brandenburg Gate on Friday. "Burning a flag is not a crime, whether it be Israeli or American or from any other nation" Berlin police spokesman Thomas Neuendorf explained to DW. "The only exception is, for instance, when a flag is taken from an official building like an embassy and burned." Burning any kind of objects is forbidden at demonstrations but is only a misdemeanor. Neuendorf said that 10 people were detained at demonstrations over the weekend for throwing bottles and comparable offenses. Demonstrators burned symbols of Israel, causing outrage among politicians Image: picture alliance/dpa/Jüdisches Forum für Demokratie und gegen Antisemitismus e.V.

The relationship between this image and the news events set is

 complementary.

The image shows a man wearing a yarmulke, which is a Jewish religious symbol. The man is standing in front of a menorah, which is a Jewish religious symbol. The image is taken from a low angle, which makes the man look powerful and imposing. The image is also dark and shadowy, which creates a sense of mystery and intrigue.

The news events set is about anti-Semitism in Germany. The news events set includes the burning of Israeli flags, the chanting of anti-Semitic slogans, and the threatening of Jewish people. The image is complementary to the news events set because it provides a visual representation of the anti-Semitism that is happening in Germany. The image shows that anti-Semitism is not just a problem that is happening in the past, but it is also a problem that is happening in the present. The image is a reminder that we need to be vigilant against anti-Semitism and that we need to work to create a more tolerant and inclusive society.

Anti-Semitism was still showing "its evil face" in Germany, said President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

News article:
The Israeli flag was recently burned at a protest in Berlin — and with it the Star of David. That it happened in Germany is particularly scandalous, because it awakens memories of the Nazi persecution of the Jews. Israeli flags were burned at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin earlier this week during protests against the decision of US President Donald Trump to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The scenes quickly became an issue for almost all political parties in Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the acts, as well as all ministers and the parties represented in German parliament, the Bundestag. "Those who set the Israeli flag on fire in German squares not only show intolerable hatred of Israel, but also do not understand or respect what it means to be German," said President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. This week Steinmeier made a special call to Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, and spoke of "deeply disturbing expressions of anti-Semitism." The president expressed his shock and shame that something like this would happen in Germany in 2017. The protests in Berlin sparked a strong response from Germany's political leaders Image: picture alliance/dpa/Jüdisches Forum für Demokratie und gegen Antisemitismus e.V. The Star used as stigmatization The magnitude of the response is also due to the fact that the Star of David, the hexagram, a religious and political symbol of the Jews and the State of Israel, is emblazoned in the middle of the country's flag. The resulting scenes over the weekend thus showed the Star of David being burned at the Brandenburg Gate, the very place where the torch-holding Nazis marched in January 1933, after the taking power. During the pogroms on the evenings of November 9 and 10 in 1938, synagogues, Jewish institutions and Jewish-owned shops were burned in Germany — and with them the Star of David. From 1941 onwards, the Nazis forced the Jews, or persons considered to be Jewish according to "race laws," to wear the star as identification. The star was printed on a yellow background, which was inspired by Christian princes in the Middle Ages, who ordered yellow patches to be worn on clothing to make Jews recognizable to them. In this way, the star became a symbol for the mass murder of millions of Jews in Europe during the Second World War by Nazi Germany. Steinmeier visited the Israeli embassy in Berlin on Friday for an event marking the country's 70th anniversary Image: picture-alliance/dpa/M. Gambarini Debate about ban on flag burning Nevertheless, it is not illegal to burn an Israeli flag in Germany, at least not if it is a privately acquired flag. Now, however, after the incidents in Berlin, there is a discussion as to whether German lawmakers should address this issue. Israel's ambassador in Berlin, Jeremy Issacharoff, suggested that German public burning of any foreign flags should be punishable, not only Israel's. Representatives of a range of political camps in Germany expressed their agreement. "Anyone who burns Israeli flags questions Israel's right to exist and is rejecting the country," said Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. Defending Israel's right to exist is a matter of national interest for Germany. However, the more that conflicts between Muslims, Christians and Jews are brought to Berlin, the more often this national interest will be called into question. Not officially, but within German society. Berlin's Jewish community recently raised the alarm: Its anti-Semitism commissioner, Sigmount Königsberg, reported that openly appearing Jewish can be problematic in the German capital. "I know many Jews who conceal a chain with a Star of David in the subway. There are now such automatic actions."

News article:
After a wave of anti-Israeli protests, German authorities feel arriving refugees and migrants must be firmly reminded of the country's responsibility to the Jewish state accrued during the Nazi Holocaust. Anti-Israel and anti-US rallies and the sight of Israeli flags burned on German streets have triggered the German politicians' concerns. All people who live in Germany must understand its historical responsibility to Israel, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on Friday at an event marking the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the Jewish state. “This responsibility does not end for the people who were born [after the Holocaust] and has no exceptions for the immigrants,” he said, adding that it is “not a subject to discussion for anyone living in Germany or willing to live there.” Justice Minister Heiko Maas took the idea further, suggesting that the issue of Holocaust should be a central part of the German integration courses for refugees and migrants. “I believe it is absolutely necessary to make Holocaust and its significance for our society a central topic in our integration courses,” the minister said in a piece written for Der Spiegel weekly. “Lessons learnt from the Holocaust must become the key message of those [courses],” he added. At the same time, the minister pointed out that the German authorities would not tolerate any form of anti-Semitism, including that brought to Germany by refugees and migrants from the Middle East. “Racism has no place in Germany, so everyone who wants to stay in Germany for the long term needs to be clear that we fight the Neo-Nazis’ anti-Semitism and we won’t tolerate any imported anti-Semitism from immigrants either,” Maas said. “Those who call for ‘death to Jews’ should not [be allowed to] take to the streets but should be taken to court instead,” he added. Pro-Palestinian protests have gripped Germany in the wake of the US President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel without regard for Palestinian's claim to the holy city. Jens Spahn, a senior member of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union Party warned that the growing anti-Semitism is in fact a result of a massive inflow of refugees and migrants from the Middle East to Germany. Many refugees and migrants come from countries where anti-Semitism is “an omnipresent part of the everyday life,” the politician told Der Spiegel. He went on to say that these people are likely to have deep-rooted anti-Semitic sentiments and it would take time to make them change their minds. At the same time, he demanded that the German Muslim associations take a clearer stand on the issue and help the authorities to curb anti-Semitic sentiments. “In case of anti-Islamic hatred, you have every right to expect that we will take measures against it,” he said, addressing the German Muslim leaders and adding that “it also means however, that we should all make a stand against anti-Semitism.” Earlier, the outbreaks of anti-Semitism at Berlin’s rallies were also condemned by the Jewish community and the German politicians across the political spectrum.

After a wave of anti-Israeli protests, German authorities feel arriving refugees and migrants must be firmly reminded of the country's responsibility to the Jewish state accrued during the Nazi Holocaust.

Germany’s acting interior minister has lent his support to the creation of an anti-Semitism commissioner in the country’s next government. Thomas de Maiziere nailed his colors to the mast in an interview with German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, following demonstrations in Berlin in which people protesting the US decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel were reportedly seen burning the Israeli flag. The creation of the role was also recommended by Germany’s Central Council of Jews as well as an independent panel of experts. “A single crime motivated by anti-Semitism is one too many and shameful for our country,” he told the paper. “Hatred towards Jews must never be allowed to take hold of Germany again.” De Maziere also said that Germany “cannot tolerate” the burning of another country’s flag as it constitutes “the symbolic annihilation of a country’s right to exist.” Berlin police ban US & Israeli flags at protests, tighten control over pro-Palestinian demos https://t.co/dlfHB8nsMIpic.twitter.com/JErcbabW83 — RT (@RT_com) December 15, 2017 US President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital sparked protests outside the US Embassy in central Berlin and in Neukoelln, a borough of the German capital known for its high concentration of immigrants. Last week German police took to Twitter to advise against bringing US or Israeli flags along to protest rallies against the Jerusalem decision. “Any dangerous objects as well as the US and Israeli flags are not allowed at the demo,” the Berlin police wrote in a Twitter post ahead of a pro-Palestinian rally on Friday.

Not having won a majority, Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Christian Democratic Union leader, has been frustrated in her attempts to enter into a coalition with the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU).

The image shows a man in a suit and glasses, who is identified as Thomas de Maiziere, the acting interior minister of Germany. The news article is about the recent protests in Berlin over US President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. De Maiziere is quoted in the article as saying that "a single crime motivated by anti-Semitism is one too many and shameful for our country." He also said that Germany "cannot tolerate" the burning of another country's flag as it constitutes "the symbolic annihilation of a country's right to exist." The image is complementary to the news article because it shows the man who is responsible for dealing with the protests and who has made statements about the importance of fighting anti-Semitism.

News article:
A few hundred feet away from the protest, the names of each victim of last year’s attack were freshly inscribed along steps near the church, constituting a permanent memorial, where an arc of candles illuminated their headshots — including that of slain Israeli woman Dalia Elyakim. The memorial calls “for peaceful co-existence of all humanity.” Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and other top German officials attended the memorial’s dedication earlier that day. Elio Adler attended on behalf of WerteInitiative (Values Initiative), a lobbying effort that he heads that addresses issues of German-Jewish concern. “[German politicians] were careful to say the right words and honor the victims,” Adler said. “They don’t have a defiant kind of attitude that you would find in Israel. It’s more about, ‘We have this burden to carry and we’ll carry it.’” While the government officials spoke of mistakes that were made, with Berlin Mayor Michael Müller asking for “forgiveness” for the oversights that enabled the 2016 attack, Adler would like to see these words backed by action. He is also uncertain how the government will crack down on the aggressive anti-Israel protests throughout Germany in response to President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. “They are not prepared for Islamist protests just like they were not prepared for Islamic terror,” Adler said, though he and other Jewish community leaders and commentators are acknowledging that they have seen some improvement in official responses to the recent protests. “We had such situations in the past, and we had even worse [anti-Israel] demonstrations in recent years,” said Eldad Beck, author of the 2015 book Germany, at Odds, and the Berlin correspondent for Israel Hayom. “Unfortunately, it did not wake up the German authorities in doing something concrete against the phenomenon. What we can say is that the official reactions to what happened were this time much faster than in recent years.” The anti-Israel protests at Kurfurstendamm during Operation Protective Edge in 2014 were a turning point for the Jewish community in Germany and its sense of safety against antisemitic assaults. Muslim protesters, notoriously shouted, “Jews to the gas,” as police looked on. It took several weeks for German politicians, then on summer vacation, to issue condemnations. Every year, Shia and Hezbollah-backed groups hold an annual anti-Israel “Al Quds Day” demonstration in Berlin, although the recent protests, according to the American Jewish Committee’s (AJC) local office, were actually backed by Sunni elements with possible links to Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. As the recent protests erupted, AJC released a study finding that antisemitic and anti-Israel attitudes and stereotypes are widespread among Arab refugees in Germany. Radicalism in the Muslim-German population is not being properly addressed, according to AJC Berlin’s director, Deidre Berger. “Although the problem of Islamic radicalization has been constantly on the rise, particularly since outbreak of the Syrian war, there are far too few prevention and de-radicalization programs,” she told JNS. “The radicalization takes place in an increasingly, Israel-hostile environment in parts of the Muslim community, including growing numbers of Germans of Turkish origin, a worrisome development.”

News article:
Charlotte Knobloch, President of the Jewish Community of Munich and Upper Bavaria, said online abuse and even physical attacks were 'commonplace'. Pictured in Jan 2016 Anti-Semitism is now 'the order of the day' in Germany, according to a community leader, who claims Jews now need 'police protection' to practice their religion. Charlotte Knobloch, former leader of the German Council of Jews, said online abuse and even physical attacks were 'commonplace'. She referred to several recent incidents of anti-Semitic crime, including the vandalism of a Menorah in the city of Heilbronn, and the cancellation of a public Menorah lighting in Mülheim because of security issues. Mrs Knobloch, who is now President of the Jewish Community of Munich and Upper Bavaria, claimed these attacks meant Jewish life had to take place under 'police protection', the Heilbronner Stimme reported. 'Aggressive anti-Semitism, from verbal hostility on the Internet and in the analogue world to desecration and destruction to physical attacks are commonplace in Germany,' she said. 'Jewish life can only take place in public under police protection and the strictest security precautions, or it must be completely cancelled for security reasons.' Her comments came after Germany's interior minister said the government needed to appoint an anti-Semitism commissioner to counter growing hate speech against Jews and Israel from both its home-grown far right and the immigrant community. Thomas de Maiziere's intervention followed a protest in Berlin where Israeli flags were burnt to protest the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. 'Every criminal act motivated by anti-Semitism is one too many and a shame for our country,' de Maiziere, the caretaker minister since inconclusive September elections, told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. 'Anti-Semitism must never again take hold in Germany,' he said, pointing to a rise of 'derogatory remarks, inappropriate jokes and discriminatory behaviour against our Jewish citizens'. She referred to several recent incidents of anti-Semitic crime.

De Maiziere said when Germany has a new government - which Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats are now discussing - it should appoint an anti-Semitism commissioner. Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert said last week that, although Berlin opposed the move by US President Donald Trump, it strongly condemned protests where 'hatred' of Israel and Jews was expressed. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the country needed an anti-Semitism commissioner On Friday, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier also declared himself 'shocked and shamed' by the incidents and warned that anti-Semitism was still 'showing its evil face in a variety of ways'. Steinmeier stressed Germany's responsibility to learn 'the lessons of two world wars, the lessons of the Holocaust, the responsibility for the security of Israel, the rejection of all forms of racism and anti-Semitism'. This was 'non-negotiable' for everyone who lives in Germany, no matter where and when they were born, he added. Justice Minister Heiko Maas demanded that lessons on the Holocaust be included in integration courses that teach German language and civics to asylum seekers and immigrants. He wrote on Spiegel Online that many 'come from countries where powerful elites intentionally fuel hatred of Jews and Israel, and where anti-Semitism is practiced almost as a matter of course'. Maas said that all immigrants needed to understand that 'we fight against the anti-Semitism of the neo-Nazis and we will equally never tolerate an anti-Semitism imported by immigrants'.

The German flag is a symbol of Germany, and the fact that it is being flown in front of the police officers suggests that the police are there to protect the country from its enemies.

News article:
JTA - German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has come under fire for his suggestion that Israel pursues an “apartheid” policy. Now, a Jewish woman in Cologne has addressed Gabriel in an open letter, demanding an apology for “providing further ammunition to youths who were fed anti-Semitism with their mothers’ milk,” according to a report in the German Jewish weekly, the Juedische Allgemeine. As yet, there has been no such apology. At issue is an event in Berlin in mid-December, at which Gabriel addressed the issue of anti-Semitism among Muslims in Germany, with a group of Muslim communal representatives. The event was hosted by the Kreuzberg Initiative Against Anti-Semitism, a non-governmental organization that works in schools with children of migrant background, trying to combat anti-Semitic attitudes from an early age. Instead of helping fight anti-Semitism, Gabriel fed the flames, the letter from Malca Goldstein-Wolf said. In her open letter to Gabriel, published on the Israel advocacy website “Honestly Concerned” on Dec. 21, Goldstein-Wolf applauded the idea of meeting with Muslim leaders. “But if you use this occasion to repeat your defamation of Israel as an apartheid state, then it is not only counterproductive but must be vehemently condemned.” According to the Berliner Zeitung, during the meeting with Muslim representatives Gabriel mentioned that he had visited Hevron several years ago and what he saw reminded him of apartheid. In fact, he had posted words to that effect on Facebook after his visit there in 2012. Responding to a query from the German Jewish weekly, Gabriel’s office said he had emphasized at the meeting that there was no place for anti-Semitism in Germany.

News article:
Lawmaker Beatrix von Storch, accused by Cologne police of inciting hatred against Muslims, sees Israel as a model for Germany. (Nicolaus Fest) A neo-Nazi member of Germany’s parliament who has been charged by police with inciting hatred against Muslims is a big fan of Israel. Beatrix von Storch was suspended from Twitter and Facebook after she slammed police in the city of Cologne for this tweet – one of several put out in various languages – wishing the city’s residents happy new year in Arabic: #PolizeiNRW #Köln #Leverkusen تتمنى الشرطة في كولن لجميع الناس في منطقة كولن وليفركوزن والمدن الأخرى إحتفالاً سعيداً بعام 2018 الجديد. https://t.co/G5erMWFNQyرأس السنة 2017 ـ لمزيد المعلومات: # pic.twitter.com/BGxs4Kew7K — Polizei NRW K (@polizei_nrw_k) December 31, 2017 This was an apparent reference to a spate of alleged sexual assaults that were blamed on men from Muslim-majority countries in the city on New Year’s Eve two years ago, and that then fueled exaggerated or outright fabricated claims against immigrants in other parts of Germany. Police have filed a criminal complaint against von Storch for hate speech. Her posts were removed under a new online hate speech law that civil liberties advocates have warned deputizes social media companies to carry out censorship on behalf of the government. Neo-Nazis embrace Israel Von Storch is the deputy leader of Alternative for Germany – known by its German initials AfD – the neo-Nazi party that won almost 100 seats in Germany’s general election last September, prompting alarm from the country’s Jewish community. Like their neo-Nazi counterparts who just joined the government of neighboring Austria, AfD has been cozying up to Israel – a philosemitic stance that aims to rebrand the anti-Semitic far-right as defenders of Jews against a supposed Muslim threat. Their embrace has been reciprocated by politicians in Israel’s ruling Likud party. A granddaughter of Hitler’s last finance minister, von Storch told The Jerusalem Report last September that “For historical and cultural reasons, we will always look for good relations and close cooperation with Israel.” She has been very explicit not only about her party’s support for Israel, but also that hatred of Muslims is one of the values she shares with its Zionist ideology. “Both anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism are strongest in the Islamic community, as well as the Left,” she explained. “They reject the fact that the Judeo-Christian foundations of European civilization are instrumental to its success. We recognize the threat they pose to both Israel and Germany’s Jewish community and their safety is a high priority for us.” Von Storch concluded that “Israel could be a role model for Germany” as a country that “makes efforts to preserve its unique culture and traditions.” This echoes closely the line of American neo-Nazi demagogue Richard Spencer who speaks of Zionism as a key model for the kind of Aryan homeland he seeks to create under the guise of preserving “European” culture. Not surprisingly, von Storch’s Jerusalem Report interview was promoted approvingly by Breitbart, a major platform for racism and white supremacy. Israel as racist model Von Storch’s identification with Israel is a symptom of the long-standing alliance between the right, and even anti-Semites, on the one hand, and Zionism and Israel, on the other. This alliance has recently found new life in a common hatred of Muslims. Israeli leaders have habitually exploited violent attacks in Europe to further stoke Islamophobia and justify their own violence against Palestinians. Yet while many mainstream commentators in Germany can be expected to express horror at von Storch’s anti-Muslim incitement, few dare speak out in criticism of Israel – including its prominent role in fomenting xenophobia and hatred of Muslims as part of its effort to push Europe further into its far-right camp. Indeed, Germany’s establishment appears to be less tolerant than ever of advocacy for full, equal civil, political and human rights for Palestinians. In December, the city council in Munich passed a measure smearing the BDS – boycott, divestment and sanctions – movement. The Palestinian BDS National Committee had written to city councillors to explain that the definition of anti-Semitism cited in the resolution is one drawn up by Israel lobbyists to deliberately conflate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism. Yet there do appear to be cracks. Foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel is under intense attack from Israel for stating a simple truth. Israel’s public security minister Gilad Erdan, who is also in charge of combatting the BDS movement, accused Gabriel of engaging in speech that “demonizes and delegitimizes the Jewish state.” Gabriel reportedly told a group of Muslim representatives in December that when he visited the occupied West Bank city of Hebron a few years ago, what he witnessed reminded him of apartheid.

Israel as racist model Von Storch’s identification with Israel is a symptom of the long-standing alliance between the right, and even anti-Semites, on the one hand, and Zionism and Israel, on the other. This alliance has recently found new life in a common hatred of Muslims. Israeli leaders have habitually exploited violent attacks in Europe to further stoke Islamophobia and justify their own violence against Palestinians. Yet while many mainstream commentators in Germany can be expected to express horror at von Storch’s anti-Muslim incitement, few dare speak out in criticism of Israel – including its prominent role in fomenting xenophobia and hatred of Muslims as part of its effort to push Europe further into its far-right camp. Indeed, Germany’s establishment appears to be less tolerant than ever of advocacy for full, equal civil, political and human rights for Palestinians. In December, the city council in Munich passed a measure smearing the BDS – boycott, divestment and sanctions – movement. The Palestinian BDS National Committee had written to city councillors to explain that the definition of anti-Semitism cited in the resolution is one drawn up by Israel lobbyists to deliberately conflate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism. Yet there do appear to be cracks. Foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel is under intense attack from Israel for stating a simple truth. Israel’s public security minister Gilad Erdan, who is also in charge of combatting the BDS movement, accused Gabriel of engaging in speech that “demonizes and delegitimizes the Jewish state.” Gabriel reportedly told a group of Muslim representatives in December that when he visited the occupied West Bank city of Hebron a few years ago, what he witnessed reminded him of apartheid.

News article:
New migrants to Germany must visit Nazi concentration camp memorials to help tackle a perceived rise in anti-Semitism, Germany's Central Council of Jews said on Wednesday, supporting a proposal by a Palestinian-German politician. Anti-Semitism remains a sensitive issue in Germany, one of Israel's closest allies, more than 70 years after the end of the Nazi-era Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews were killed. The government decried as shameful the spectacle of the Israeli flag being burned at demonstrations last month against U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Josef Schuster, head of the Central Council of Jews expressed support for a proposal by Sawsan Chebli, a Berlin state senator, for mandatory visits by newly arrived refugees to Nazi concentration camps memorials. "People who have fled to us who have themselves had to escape or been expelled, can develop empathy in such memorials," Schuster told Deutschlandfunk radio on Wednesday. Germany has received well over a million migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. Germany is home today to an estimated 200,000 Jews and has built a reputation in recent decades as a tolerant, safe place for Jews to live - though data shows anti-Semitic crimes reported to the police rose 4 percent to 681 in the first eight months of 2017 from the same period in 2016. "It makes sense for everyone living in this country to be obliged to visit a concentration camp memorial site at least once in their lives," Chebli told Bild am Sonntag newspaper on Sunday when she first floated the proposal. She said such visits, long a staple of high school education in a country determined that the lessons of its history not be forgotten, should also be extended to new migrants, who should make trips as part of their compulsory integration courses. Currently, the integration courses focus on learning the German language and about Germany's history, culture and its legal system Asked about the possibility of mandatory visits to concentration camps, a spokeswoman for the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ministry said the integration course for immigrants already had a module regarding the consequences of the Nazi rule for the people of Germany and Europe. Last month, Germany's justice minister called for more emphasis on the Holocaust in migrants' integration courses. Schuster said everyone who wanted to live permanently in Germany must identify with its history. Such visits, which should be prepared by schools, would show where anti-Semitism and hatred for Jews could lead, he said.

News article:
https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/11743/germany-antisemitism Finally, it seems, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government is proposing legislation that might even include deporting migrants who are anti-Semites, according to Die Welt. The alarming scale of anti-Semitism in Germany has been escalating with newly arrived refugees, mainly from Muslim lands, and causing the government previously to launch a desperate integration program with a warning that this kind of hatred would not be tolerated in the country. The German government also decided to introduce extensive discussions about Germany’s Nazi past in the course designed to make newcomers integrate into democratic societies. The situation seemed to be getting out of control with escalating anti-Semitism among more than a million asylum seekers from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Teachers familiar with the curriculum, however, predict a bleak future for the efforts to convince the Muslim refugees about European history of Nazi Germany: most of them are already drunk with the anti-Semitic propaganda spread across the Muslim world by Nazi-sympathizing Islamists. The course book introduced by Federal Bureau for Immigration and Refugees (Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge, BAMF), carries a full chapter and other small sections about the Holocaust and the atrocities committed by Nazi regime against Jewish citizens of Europe. A senior teacher for the integration course, requesting anonymity, told this author that she finds most of the Muslim participants struggling to understand the Nazi crimes, with many of them soft towards Nazis or assuming that the Jews were to be blamed for Holocaust instead of being the victims of it. One chapter, titled, Eine Zeitzeugin Berichtet (“An Eyewitness Reports”), narrates the ordeal of a Holocaust survivor, Magda Hollander-Lafon. Ms Lafon, an Auschwitz survivor, narrates how her mother and sister were gassed to death while she endured unspeakable torture, hunger and thirst to survive the horrors. The teachers, however, always hear from some of the Muslim students that the Jews must have been responsible for being treated that way because they had opposed the Nazi regime. Many of them believe, she said, that each and every Jew is responsible for the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Many participants in these Muslim integration courses, in fact, seem to justify the acts of Nazis by associating their own Muslim hatred against Jews concerning the Palestine issue. The situation also becomes even more surreal when the majority of the Muslim students in class are faced with face counter-arguments from other participants, who are now in minority in these integration classes. A Syrian-Jewish young man, for instance, came forward to counter the claim of Middle Eastern students that the Muslim regimes in their lands provided equal safety and respect to non-Muslim citizens. The young man from Damascus, also seeking anonymity, explained that life is hell for Jews, Christians and citizens of other religious minorities in most Muslim countries, including Syria. He added that the local tiny Jewish community in Damascus lived under constant threat of robberies, extortion and abductions; that he himself had twice been a victim of abduction for ransom, and that each time his family had to pay a heavy ransom to Islamists to buy his freedom after his abductors had threatened to kill him if the money were not paid. He said that Jewish immigrants who reached Germany and Europe do not feel safe inside the migrant camps where majority of the immigrants have hostile views towards Jews. He added that this fear was why the majority of Middle Eastern Jews abstain from revealing their identities to the people around them, and try to look for some relatives or volunteers who are willing to give them shelter for a while. In the meantime, the recent marches organized by Islamists in Berlin as a response to US President Donald Trump’s declaration of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel revealed the real face of Islamists. They burned images of the Star of David and chanted anti-Israel slogans while burning Israeli flags — exposing the deep-rooted hatred and racism of many Muslims, German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government seemed baffled by the extreme demonstration of anti-Semitism by those protesting President Trump’s decision. Such an incontrovertible display of anti-Semitism made Chancellor Merkel and then Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière warn everyone that Germany will not tolerate any kind of anti-Semitism. The incident, however, was just tip of the iceberg: Jewish citizens in Germany face horrific harassment during their day-to-day life in public places and schools. In Berlin, a 14-year- old Jewish boy was forced to change schools after increasing bullying and intimidation by pupils of Turkish and Arab descent. After his fellow students discovered that he is a Jew, he was threatened with a fake pistol and subjected to intense verbal abuse. In addition, Mekan Kolasinac, a local politician in the city of Saarlouis of the Left Party, which is known for its anti-Israel views, branded the party’s federal head, Bernd Riexinger, a “sneaky Jew” in a Facebook post. Although Kolasinac later decided to apologize for his comment, it had already exposed hateful mindset that exists even among the relatively influential section of society. A study conducted by German government revealed that 33 million Germans, around 40% of country’s population, appear to share a modern form of anti-Semitism Recently, a member of Green party of the Bundestag, Volker Beck, told Deutsche Welle, “Forty percent agree with Israeli-centered anti-Semitism, That’s almost half of the society. It says a lot about the intellectual environment in which Jews have to live.” This dangerous mix of local anti-Semites and newly arrived Muslims provide the newcomers with a compelling opportunity to flourish, and to further whatever violent designs many may have against the Jewish people. This new generation of anti-Semites knows the laws and seem well-trained to juggle around the legal loopholes to express their thoughts. That is why those in Berlin brought a homemade Israeli flag to burn, but may well avoid jail because in court it may be proven that it was not an exact flag of Israel. This is how the extremist attendees of integration courses are able to present their anti-Semitic thoughts. They just stop just short of denying the Holocaust and avoid directly praising their idol (Hitler), yet they comfortably discuss that Jews earned the ferocity of Nazis for opposing them. It is ironic that all this harassment against the Jewish citizens takes place under the nose of law, which theoretically does not allow hate speech. The authorities, however, appear to feel helpless about curbing the extremism against Jewish members of their society. The situation demands an immediate review of policies and laws evidently too feeble to protect all residents equally, not to mention the even greater feebleness of political will to implement those laws. The situation demands an immediate review of policies and laws evidently too feeble to protect all residents equally, not to mention the even greater feebleness of political will to implement those laws. If not stopped and countered in a timely way, possibly by these new proposals, this nest of hate-mongers carries with it the potential to push Germany into another really ugly time.

News article:
Berlin – German lawmakers have voted to install a commissioner who would coordinate government activities against anti-Semitism. The lower house approved by a wide majority Thursday a motion proposed by four of the six parliamentary groups to install the official, who would be chosen by independent experts. The center-left Social Democrats called for the commissioner to be installed at the chancellery. The decision follows a recommendation by a panel of experts and comes amid concern over anti-Semitic incidents during recent pro-Palestinian protests. Volker Kauder, the parliamentary leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative Union bloc, told lawmakers that far-right motives are behind the bulk of anti-Semitic crimes but there’s been a rising number of acts by migrants. He said “we must not allow either of these things.”

The Bundestag is where the vote to install a commissioner to coordinate government activities against anti-Semitism took place. Therefore, the image is highly related to the news article.

The image shows a man wearing a kippah with the German and Israeli flags on it. This is a symbol of Jewish identity and pride, and it is likely that the man is wearing it to show his support for Israel. The image is taken at a public event, which suggests that the man is not afraid to show his support for Israel, even though there is a risk of anti-Semitism in Germany. This image is complementary to the news events set because it provides visual evidence of the anti-Semitism that is still present in Germany, and it also shows that there are people who are willing to stand up to anti-Semitism.

REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/File Photo DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi oil giant Aramco said its plants and facilities are operating normally after Yemen’s Houthi movement announced on Thursday it had fired a short-range ballistic missile towards an Aramco facility in the southern Saudi province of Najran. There was no immediate comment from Saudi authorities about the report, which was carried by Houthi TV al-Massirah and the Houthi-controlled news agency SABA. The report did not identify the facility that was targeted in Najran, where Aramco has some offices and a loading facility. The Iranian-aligned Houthis have launched scores of missiles at the kingdom - causing little serious damage - since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015. The coalition moved in after the armed Houthi movement drove Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of supplying missile parts and expertise to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and other parts of the country during its civil war. Iran and the Houthis deny the charge.

An Egyptian national was killed by shrapnel in Saudi Arabia on Sunday when Saudi forces shot down seven ballistic missiles launched by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said. Saudi air-defence forces say they intercepted three missiles aimed at the capital Riyadh and four others fired at the southern cities of Khamis Mushait, Najran and Jizan, according to Colonel Turki Al-Malki, spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. Shrapnel from the missiles fell on residential areas in Riyadh, killing an Egyptian resident and wounding two other Egyptians, the SPA quoted Al-Malki as saying. "This hostile action and indiscriminate action by the Iran-backed Houthi group proves the continued involvement of the Iranian regime in supporting the armed Houthi group with qualitative capabilities," Al-Malki said. "The firing of multiple ballistic missiles towards populated cities contravenes international human laws and ... is a serious development." The Saudi-led coalition launched an airstrike campaign in Yemen in March 2015 to fight Iran-backed Houthi rebels after they seized parts of Yemen, including the capial Sanaa and forced President Abd Rabbu Mansour Al-Hadi to flee. The Saudi military says the Houthis have fired dozens of missiles into Saudi Arabia since last year, all of which were intercepted. Search Keywords: Short link:

Thanks to our heroes in the Air Defense pic.twitter.com/l5u3wTnBKa — Baderᵒོ.. (@Bader_mine) March 25, 2018 A photo from the Houthi Military Media Unit shows the launch of a ballistic missile aimed at Saudi Arabia Seven missile were fired by Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen into Saudi Arabia overnight, with the kingdom's military claiming to have shot down all seven However, one video showed a rocket which appeared to malfunction and slam back into the city. Other video showed a missile landing in the middle of a highway, with the wreckage pictured on social media afterward. It was unclear if this was a Saudi missile, or one fired by the Houthis. The attack came on the third anniversary of the Saudi-led coalition's intervention in Yemen. 'This aggressive and hostile action by the Iran-backed Houthi group proves that the Iranian regime continues to support the armed group with military capabilities,' coalition spokesman Turki al-Malki said. 'The firing of multiple ballistic missiles towards cities is a serious development.' The Houthi-run Al-Masira television channel claimed the rebels had targeted Riyadh's King Khalid International Airport as well as other airstrips in the south. The strikes come after the US defence secretary last week urged Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during his visit to Washington to pursue 'urgent efforts' to end Yemen's conflict. The Houthi rebels have fired dozens of missiles into Saudi Arabia since last year, all of which Saudi forces claim to have intercepted, though doubts have been raised over several of the claims. Last night's attack underscores the capacity of the rebels to strike deep within Saudi amid a stalemated war in Yemen. The latest attack could further escalate the coalition's military campaign. A major attack targeting Riyadh international airport on November 4 triggered the tightening of a Saudi-led blockade of Yemen - already on the verge of famine. Another strike on December 19 targeted Riyadh's Yamamah palace, the official residence of King Salman. The Houthi-run Al-Masira television channel claimed the rebels had targeted Riyadh's King Khalid International Airport as well as other airstrips in the south Video showed Saudi defence missiles being fired over Riyadh, though other footage appeared to show a missile malfunctioning and slamming back into the city The attack came on the third anniversary of Saudi Arabia's intervention in the Yemen conflict, which the UN says is the world's worst humanitarian disaster Saudi Arabia has accused its arch foe Iran of supplying the missile to the rebels, a charge Tehran strongly denied. The Houthis expelled pro-government forces from the capital in September 2014 and went on to seize swathes of the impoverished Arabian peninsula country. This prompted a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia to intervene in Yemen on March 26, 2015, to help the government push back the Shiite rebels. Since then, around 10,000 people have been killed and 53,000 wounded in Yemen, triggering what the United Nations has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Houthi rebel chief Abdelmalik al-Huthi on Sunday said his fighters were ready to make more 'sacrifices' against the Saudi-led coalition, in an address marking the war's third anniversary. The Houthis plan a huge rally in Sanaa on Monday to mark the anniversary. The UN says living conditions in the war-scarred country have reached catastrophic levels and that 8.4 million people face imminent famine. The UN urgently needs $350million for humanitarian projects in Yemen, a senior agency official said on Sunday, insisting it was mere 'peanuts' compared with the cost of the country's war. Saudi Arabia and its allies - aided by billions of dollars worth of military equipment from the US and Britain - could stand guilty of war crimes, Amnesty International said on Friday. Numerous rounds of UN-sponsored peace talks have failed to stem the bloodshed in Yemen.

Other video showed a missile landing in the middle of a highway, with the wreckage pictured on social media afterward. It was unclear if this was a Saudi missile, or one fired by the Houthis. The attack came on the third anniversary of the Saudi-led coalition's intervention in Yemen. 'This aggressive and hostile action by the Iran-backed Houthi group proves that the Iranian regime continues to support the armed group with military capabilities,' coalition spokesman Turki al-Malki said. 'The firing of multiple ballistic missiles towards cities is a serious development.' The Houthi-run Al-Masira television channel claimed the rebels had targeted Riyadh's King Khalid International Airport as well as other airstrips in the south. The strikes come after the US defence secretary last week urged Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during his visit to Washington to pursue 'urgent efforts' to end Yemen's conflict. The Houthi rebels have fired dozens of missiles into Saudi Arabia since last year, all of which Saudi forces claim to have intercepted, though doubts have been raised over several of the claims. Last night's attack underscores the capacity of the rebels to strike deep within Saudi amid a stalemated war in Yemen. The latest attack could further escalate the coalition's military campaign. A major attack targeting Riyadh international airport on November 4 triggered the tightening of a Saudi-led blockade of Yemen - already on the verge of famine. Another strike on December 19 targeted Riyadh's Yamamah palace, the official residence of King Salman.

The Houthis expelled pro-government forces from the capital in September 2014 and went on to seize swathes of the impoverished Arabian peninsula country. This prompted a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia to intervene in Yemen on March 26, 2015, to help the government push back the Shiite rebels. Since then, around 10,000 people have been killed and 53,000 wounded in Yemen, triggering what the United Nations has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Houthi rebel chief Abdelmalik al-Huthi on Sunday said his fighters were ready to make more 'sacrifices' against the Saudi-led coalition, in an address marking the war's third anniversary.

The UN says living conditions in the war-scarred country have reached catastrophic levels and that 8.4 million people face imminent famine. The UN urgently needs $350million for humanitarian projects in Yemen, a senior agency official said on Sunday, insisting it was mere 'peanuts' compared with the cost of the country's war.

News article:
The firing of seven ballistic missiles at Saudi Arabi by Yemen's rebels comes at a precarious time. Experts and former diplomats contend that the attack on Sunday, on the eve of the third anniversary of start of the war, is largely symbolic for the Houthis as a way to demonstrate military capabilities, but it could derail a new UN push to resume political talks. Gerald Feierstein, the director for Gulf affairs at the Middle East Institute, cautioned against over-reading the attack. "The timing is related to the third anniversary of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, and each party is attempting to demonstrate on the military side that they are making progress and achieving their goals", said Mr Feierstein, a career US diplomat who last served in Yemen in 2013. While the Saudi-led coalition says it is advancing in the north and Saada province, the rebel stronghold, "this was a message from the Houthis to demonstrate that they are far from defeated, that they can threaten Saudi security", he told The National. The attack puts the United States in a tougher position as it pushes for political negotiations. Last week, Defence Secretary James Mattis pledged to work with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in seeking an end to the war. The State Department on Monday condemned the Houthi attack, reiterating support for “the right of our Saudi partners to defend their borders”, but also urged a “return to political negotiations and move toward ending the war in Yemen”. ____________ Read more: Saudi-led coalition says Iran supplied missiles fired at Riyadh Attack on Saudi Arabia calls for a firm stance ____________ Peter Salisbury, a non-resident fellow who studies Yemen at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, said the attack came amid “an uptick in back channel negotiations over an end to the conflict”. “It could make it a lot harder," he said. The United Nations' new special envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths arrived on his first trip to Sanaa on Saturday, while the Saudi crown prince is scheduled to meet UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in New York this week, and US efforts have intensified via Oman to block arms smuggling to the Houthis by land and sea routes. “This is the largest cross-border attack since the conflict started,” said Mr Salisbury. Although Patriot defence systems were successful in intercepting the missiles, the attack leaves everyone in a sticky spot on how to move forward, he said. Another question looming over the attack is the role of Iran, and the response of the US administration in light of changes in President Donald Trump's team. The US president has picked Iran policy hawks Mike Pompeo and John Bolton as his new secretary of state and national security adviser respectively, with Mr Bolton to assume his post as soon as April 9. The appointments of Mr Pompeo and Mr Bolton could bring “a more right-wing hawkish view, that views Yemen and a Saudi-Iran proxy conflict” in a way that prolongs the confrontation, said Mr Salisbury. But it could also mean a new US approach behind a political process. Mr Feierstein said that beyond rhetoric, and counter-terrorism, the US has not done much on Yemen in the past 15 months. While acknowledging the need for more pressure on Iran, the former US ambassador advocated for a US diplomatic push to promote a political process. "That is something that [outgoing secretary of state] Rex Tillerson hasn’t done much and that Mr Pompeo could be doing,” he said. Separately, the White House announced on Monday the conclusion of the first trilateral meeting of national security advisers of the US, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The meeting was held on Friday "to discuss issues of strategic importance to the three countries, including joint efforts to counter the Iranian regime’s malign influence and provocative behaviour", the White House said. It said the meeting was attended by senior US officials from the state, defence and treasury departments and the intelligence community participated. The situation in Afghanistan was also discussed in a session attended by the Afghan national security adviser.

News article:
By News desk RIYADH/SANAA: The Houthi movement that controls northern Yemen vowed on Monday to fire more missiles into Saudi Arabia unless it stops bombing the country, after missiles crashed into Riyadh overnight causing casualties in the Saudi capital for the first time. The incident threatens to sharply escalate a war that has already unleashed what the United Nations considers the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis. Millions of people live under threat of mass starvation and disease, at the mercy of combatants who have shut food and medical supplies in the past. Saudi forces said they shot down three missiles over Riyadh shortly before midnight. Debris fell on a home in the capital, killing an Egyptian resident and wounding two other Egyptians. Air defences also repelled missiles fired at the southern Saudi cities of Najran, Jizan and Khamis Mushait, Saudi-led coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said. A top Houthi leader hailed the attack, which took place on the eve of the third anniversary of the entry into the Yemen war by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies. “We praise the successful advance of military capabilities,” Houthi political council chief Saleh al-Samad told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters in the Yemeni capital Sanaa. “If they want peace, as we have said to them before, stop your air strikes and we will stop our missiles,” he said. “If you continue your air strikes we have a right to defend ourselves by all means available.” The war pits a coalition of Sunni Arab states friendly to the West against a Shia armed movement sympathetic to Iran. The Houthis control the north of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa. Saudi Arabia and its allies have been fighting on behalf of an exiled government with a foothold in the south. Khattab Gamal, a 27-year-old Egyptian electrician who lived in the Riyadh house hit by the debris, told Reuters he and his 15 housemates were awoken by loud explosions. “We knew something fell on the room where Abdulmuttalib was asleep. There were three others in the same room with him. All were asleep at the time of explosion. They all rushed and ran out and then we realized he was missing.” “We kept looking for him and realized he was still inside, we went back and tried to enter the room and save him but we couldn’t,” Gamal said by telephone. “There was a lot of dust and the smell was suffocating. A few minutes later the civil defence came and got him out but he was already dead.” The Saudi-led coalition has launched thousands of air strikes on Yemen in the past three years, some of which have hit hospitals, schools and markets, killing hundreds of civilians while bringing Riyadh little closer to military victory. The kingdom has said hundreds of its own soldiers and civilians have been killed in Houthi mortar and short-range missile attacks across their rugged southern border. The United Nations says 10,000 people have died so far in the war in the region’s poorest country, and three out of four Yemenis - 22 million civilians - need relief aid. The conflict has caused the worst cholera outbreak in modern history, with more than 1 million reported cases. Last year, when the Houthis fired missiles at Riyadh which were intercepted without doing damage, the Arab coalition responded by shutting Yemen’s airports and ports, a blockade that the United Nations said raised the prospect of mass starvation before it was partially lifted. Western countries have urged Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies to protect civilians and find a quick end to the war. But they also support Riyadh’s argument that it needs to defend itself from cross border strikes and limit the spread of Iranian influence in territory overlooking important trade routes. “The transfer of missile capabilities to non-state actors that may be used against states is irresponsible and contrary to law,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a statement on Monday, appearing to refer to Iran. The United Arab Emirates, a key ally of Saudi Arabia in its military campaign, blamed Iran directly. “The message of the Houthi-Iranian missiles is clear,” said Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash wrote on his official Twitter account. “There’s no coexisting with a terrorist militia which threatens the stability of our region and is a proxy of Tehran.” Pakistan too condemned the missile attack, as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: “Pakistan commends the Government of Saudi Arabia for destroying the missiles and limiting the casualties.” “The Government of Pakistan reiterated its full support and solidarity with the leadership, the government and people of Saudi Arabia against any threats to its territorial integrity and against the Harmain Sharifain.” Separately Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif in a tweet said, “We strongly condemn missile attack on Saudi Arabia. Pakistan remains fully committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom.” The Saudi military depends on service contracts with Western arms companies to keep its planes flying. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman discussed the war with US President Donald Trump during a visit to the White House last week, and with British Prime Minister Theresa May in London the previous week. Saudi Arabia viewed the 2014 takeover of Sanaa by the Houthis as part of a regional strategy by arch-foe Tehran to encircle it. Independent UN experts reported to the Security Council in January that Houthi missiles they had examined and other military equipment had been manufactured in Iran. The Houthis deny they are Iranian pawns, and say their movement has spawned a national revolution against corruption. Diplomats and Yemeni political officials reported this month that the Houthis and Saudi Arabia were conducting secret peace talks after years of UN-mediated dialogue yielded no results.

But they also support Riyadh’s argument that it needs to defend itself from cross border strikes and limit the spread of Iranian influence in territory overlooking important trade routes. “The transfer of missile capabilities to non-state actors that may be used against states is irresponsible and contrary to law,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a statement on Monday, appearing to refer to Iran. The United Arab Emirates, a key ally of Saudi Arabia in its military campaign, blamed Iran directly. “The message of the Houthi-Iranian missiles is clear,” said Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash wrote on his official Twitter account. “There’s no coexisting with a terrorist militia which threatens the stability of our region and is a proxy of Tehran.” Pakistan too condemned the missile attack, as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: “Pakistan commends the Government of Saudi Arabia for destroying the missiles and limiting the casualties.” “The Government of Pakistan reiterated its full support and solidarity with the leadership, the government and people of Saudi Arabia against any threats to its territorial integrity and against the Harmain Sharifain.” Separately Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif in a tweet said, “We strongly condemn missile attack on Saudi Arabia. Pakistan remains fully committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom.” The Saudi military depends on service contracts with Western arms companies to keep its planes flying. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman discussed the war with US President Donald Trump during a visit to the White House last week, and with British Prime Minister Theresa May in London the previous week. Saudi Arabia viewed the 2014 takeover of Sanaa by the Houthis as part of a regional strategy by arch-foe Tehran to encircle it. Independent UN experts reported to the Security Council in January that Houthi missiles they had examined and other military equipment had been manufactured in Iran. The Houthis deny they are Iranian pawns, and say their movement has spawned a national revolution against corruption. Diplomats and Yemeni political officials reported this month that the Houthis and Saudi Arabia were conducting secret peace talks after years of UN-mediated dialogue yielded no results.

By News desk RIYADH/SANAA: The Houthi movement that controls northern Yemen vowed on Monday to fire more missiles into Saudi Arabia unless it stops bombing the country, after missiles crashed into Riyadh overnight causing casualties in the Saudi capital for the first time. The incident threatens to sharply escalate a war that has already unleashed what the United Nations considers the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis. Millions of people live under threat of mass starvation and disease, at the mercy of combatants who have shut food and medical supplies in the past. Saudi forces said they shot down three missiles over Riyadh shortly before midnight. Debris fell on a home in the capital, killing an Egyptian resident and wounding two other Egyptians. Air defences also repelled missiles fired at the southern Saudi cities of Najran, Jizan and Khamis Mushait, Saudi-led coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said. A top Houthi leader hailed the attack, which took place on the eve of the third anniversary of the entry into the Yemen war by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies. “We praise the successful advance of military capabilities,” Houthi political council chief Saleh al-Samad told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters in the Yemeni capital Sanaa. “If they want peace, as we have said to them before, stop your air strikes and we will stop our missiles,” he said. “If you continue your air strikes we have a right to defend ourselves by all means available.” The war pits a coalition of Sunni Arab states friendly to the West against a Shia armed movement sympathetic to Iran. The Houthis control the north of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa. Saudi Arabia and its allies have been fighting on behalf of an exiled government with a foothold in the south. Khattab Gamal, a 27-year-old Egyptian electrician who lived in the Riyadh house hit by the debris, told Reuters he and his 15 housemates were awoken by loud explosions. “We knew something fell on the room where Abdulmuttalib was asleep. There were three others in the same room with him. All were asleep at the time of explosion. They all rushed and ran out and then we realized he was missing.” “We kept looking for him and realized he was still inside, we went back and tried to enter the room and save him but we couldn’t,” Gamal said by telephone. “There was a lot of dust and the smell was suffocating. A few minutes later the civil defence came and got him out but he was already dead.” The Saudi-led coalition has launched thousands of air strikes on Yemen in the past three years, some of which have hit hospitals, schools and markets, killing hundreds of civilians while bringing Riyadh little closer to military victory. The kingdom has said hundreds of its own soldiers and civilians have been killed in Houthi mortar and short-range missile attacks across their rugged southern border. The United Nations says 10,000 people have died so far in the war in the region’s poorest country, and three out of four Yemenis - 22 million civilians - need relief aid. The conflict has caused the worst cholera outbreak in modern history, with more than 1 million reported cases. Last year, when the Houthis fired missiles at Riyadh which were intercepted without doing damage, the Arab coalition responded by shutting Yemen’s airports and ports, a blockade that the United Nations said raised the prospect of mass starvation before it was partially lifted.

News article:
The seven ballistic missiles launched at four Saudi cities by the Houthis underscore the correctness of waging the war against them and the soundness of the warnings about Iran’s role in the region. It is Iran that smuggles the missiles and orchestrates their launching into Saudi Arabia. On Sunday night we witnessed the first major attack on Saudi Arabia since the start of Iran’s efforts to control Yemen three years ago. But despite the large number of missiles launched and the distance they crossed, the operation remains a mere show, and the four missiles in the skies over Riyadh were no more than fireworks. It is no coincidence that they were launched on the third anniversary of the war against the coup staged by the Houthi militias and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. While the missiles failed to hit any vital target, they succeeded in enabling the Saudi government to remind everyone that the war against the Houthis and their allies was and continues to be war of necessity. Currently, the Houthis control about a quarter of Yemen — with great difficulty, even in their stronghold Saada governorate. There was a time when they controlled all of Yemen, including the city of Aden in the south, to the extent that the legitimate government led by President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi had to flee through Oman to Saudi Arabia. Thus, had the military campaign not been launched, Yemen as a whole, not just a quarter of it, including its ports and airports, would have been under Iranian influence; and the Iranians would have been able to fire thousands of ballistic missiles and conventional rockets into Saudi territory. Those who denounce the military solution, on the third anniversary of the war, should imagine what would have happened had Yemen, or most of it, still been under the control of the Houthis and other rebels. The situation would have been frightening; much worse and more serious for both Yemen and Saudi Arabia, and would have caused a wider war than the one we have witnessed in the past 36 months. The launch of the seven missiles was a propaganda show, but it does not demonstrate a superior capability on the part of the Houthis; rather, it proves their inability to use missiles as they would wish. It also proves that the quarter of the country that they still hold in the north of Yemen requires military liberation, instead of relying solely on political action. However, the area that the Houthis control is rugged, mountainous and densely populated; moreover, the rebels are using civilians there as human shields to prevent aerial bombardment. The missile attack on Riyadh, which killed one person and injured two, confirms that Saudi Arabia and the Coalition it leads must complete the journey to Sanaa, liberate Yemen from Houthi control, and restore it as a state with a central authority headed by the legitimate government. In the past, all efforts to persuade the Coalition to halt military operations and attempt a political solution proved to be misguided; and could have led, indeed, to serious consequences. At present, however, the Houthis and the Iranians are struggling to smuggle their missiles into the country, and their numbers have been limited by the continuation of the fighting. Even the seven missiles launched on Sunday, and the ones launched before, were mostly fired at random as a result of the Coalition’s military activity, which is hunting the Houthis down in the areas under their control. Hence, any suggestion that political negotiation could reduce or stop military action would only achieve what the Houthis desire — which is to reorganize their forces on the ground and obtain more supplies of arms and fuel. Iran, through its Houthi agents, has now condemned itself in front of the new international envoy, Martin Griffiths. Met by the multiple missile attack on Saudi Arabia, Griffiths can see that a political solution cannot be based on granting the Houthis any political concessions outside the framework of the original political project; which calls for participation under the exclusive framework of the legitimate government, and the need to withdraw all weapons from the warring parties “outside” that legitimate government. There is no political solution that can justify granting the Houthis, and others, a mandate over some areas, allowing them to keep their weapons, or giving them a greater role in the political process.

Responding to reports that the Huthi armed group in Yemen fired seven ballistic missiles at airports in Riyadh and other Saudi Arabian cities overnight on Sunday, killing one civilian, Samah Hadid, Middle East Deputy Director for Campaigns at Amnesty International, said: “Launching indiscriminate attacks is prohibited by international humanitarian law and can constitute a war crime. A high death toll may have been averted, possibly due to the missiles being intercepted, but that doesn’t let the Huthi armed group off the hook for this reckless and unlawful act. These missiles cannot be precisely targeted at such distances, so their use in this manner unlawfully endangers civilians. “These unlawful attacks must not be used as an excuse by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition to indiscriminately attack civilians or further exacerbate Yemen’s humanitarian crisis by imposing yet more restrictions on importing aid and essential goods such as food, medicine and fuel. “We have documented extensively how all sides have violated international law in the Yemen conflict over the past three years. Saudi Arabia-led coalition airstrikes have recklessly destroyed and damaged Yemeni homes, hospitals, schools and markets. As a result, thousands of civilians have lost their lives and millions are displaced and in dire need of humanitarian aid. But violations by one side do not give the other side license to flout international humanitarian law.” Attack 'intercepted' According to initial media reports, including from the Saudi Arabian state press agency, all seven missiles were intercepted and destroyed, but an Egyptian national was killed after sustaining shrapnel wounds in the aftermath. The Huthi missiles were launched on the third anniversary of the beginning of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition’s campaign of airstrikes in Yemen.

News article:
The Houthi movement that controls northern Yemen vowed on Monday to fire more missiles into Saudi Arabia unless it stops bombing the country, after one of its missiles caused casualties in the Saudi capital for the first time, Reuters reports. The Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis accused them of using Iranian-made missiles. Spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said the coalition reserved the right to respond to Iran "at the appropriate time and manner", under international law and within the framework of the United Nations, to protect Saudi Arabia. The incident threatens to sharply escalate a war that has already unleashed what the United Nations considers the world's most urgent humanitarian crisis. Millions of Yemenis live under threat of mass starvation and disease, at the mercy of combatants who have sometimes cut off food and medical supplies. Saudi forces said they shot down three missiles over Riyadh shortly before midnight. Debris fell on a home in the capital, killing an Egyptian man and wounding two others. Air defences also repelled missiles fired at the southern Saudi cities of Najran, Jizan and Khamis Mushait, the coalition said. The attacks stripped away the sense of calm in Riyadh, a city which until recent months had never quite felt at war. A Houthi leader hailed the attack, which took place as Yemen marked the third anniversary of the start of the war. "We praise the successful advance of military capabilities," Houthi political council chief Saleh al-Samad told tens of thousands of supporters in the Yemeni capital Sanaa. "If they want peace, as we have said to them before, stop your air strikes and we will stop our missiles," he said. "If you continue your air strikes, we have a right to defend ourselves by all means available." The war pits a coalition of Sunni Arab states friendly to the West against the Houthis, a Shi'ite armed movement sympathetic to Iran. The Houthis, who deny they are Iranian pawns and say their movement is a national revolution against corruption, control the north of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa. Saudi Arabia and its allies have been fighting on behalf of an exiled government with a foothold in the south. Read: Yemen workers held in dire conditions in Saudi prison Al-Malki accused Iran of providing the Houthis with ballistic capabilities and said the international community must "work together to combat this dangerous escalation" which threatened security in the region and beyond. At a press event in Riyadh, he displayed what he said were the remnants of a missile fired into Riyadh alongside an Iranian-manufactured Sayyad 2 missile he said had been part of a seized shipment on its way to Houthi fighters in Yemen. Independent UN experts reported to the Security Council in January that Houthi missiles they had examined and other military equipment had been manufactured in Iran. Last year, when the Houthis fired missiles at Riyadh which were intercepted, the Arab coalition responded by shutting Yemen's airports and ports. The United Nations said that blockade raised the prospect of mass starvation before it was partially lifted. Thousands of air strikes on Yemen, some of which have hit hospitals, schools and markets, killing hundreds of civilians, have brought the coalition little closer to military victory. Saudi Arabia has said hundreds of its own soldiers and civilians have been killed in Houthi mortar and short-range missile attacks across their rugged southern border. The United Nations says 10,000 people have died in the war, and three out of four Yemenis — 22 million civilians — need relief aid. More than 1 million cholera cases have been reported, the worst outbreak in modern history. Western countries have urged Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies to protect civilians and find a quick end to the war. But they also support Riyadh's argument that it needs to defend itself from cross border strikes and limit the spread of Iranian influence in territory overlooking important trade routes. The US Pentagon blamed Iran for exacerbating the conflict. "This follows Iran's pattern of providing advanced weapons to the Houthis," spokeswoman Lieutenant Commander Rebecca Rebarich said in a statement. "Iran has enabled the conflict in Yemen to spill into neighbouring countries and undermines international efforts to resolve the conflict, exacerbating the suffering of the Yemeni people." French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, appearing to refer to Iran, said in a statement that the transfer of missile capabilities to non-state actors that may be used against states is "irresponsible and contrary to law". Anwar Gargash, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, a Saudi military ally, tweeted: "The message of the Houthi-Iranian missiles is clear. There's no coexisting with a terrorist militia which threatens the stability of our region and is a proxy of Tehran." Qatar, which has been under months of sanctions from Arab countries including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, also condemned the attacks on Saudi cities as "a violation of international law". The Saudi military depends on service contracts with Western arms companies to keep its planes flying.

News article:
The Houthi movement that controls northern Yemen vowed on Monday to fire more missiles into Saudi Arabia unless it stops bombing the country, after one of its missiles caused casualties in the Saudi capital for the first time, Reuters reports. The Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis accused them of using Iranian-made missiles. Spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said the coalition reserved the right to respond to Iran "at the appropriate time and manner", under international law and within the framework of the United Nations, to protect Saudi Arabia. The incident threatens to sharply escalate a war that has already unleashed what the United Nations considers the world's most urgent humanitarian crisis. Millions of Yemenis live under threat of mass starvation and disease, at the mercy of combatants who have sometimes cut off food and medical supplies. Saudi forces said they shot down three missiles over Riyadh shortly before midnight. Debris fell on a home in the capital, killing an Egyptian man and wounding two others. Air defences also repelled missiles fired at the southern Saudi cities of Najran, Jizan and Khamis Mushait, the coalition said. The attacks stripped away the sense of calm in Riyadh, a city which until recent months had never quite felt at war. A Houthi leader hailed the attack, which took place as Yemen marked the third anniversary of the start of the war. "We praise the successful advance of military capabilities," Houthi political council chief Saleh al-Samad told tens of thousands of supporters in the Yemeni capital Sanaa. "If they want peace, as we have said to them before, stop your air strikes and we will stop our missiles," he said. "If you continue your air strikes, we have a right to defend ourselves by all means available." The war pits a coalition of Sunni Arab states friendly to the West against the Houthis, a Shi'ite armed movement sympathetic to Iran. The Houthis, who deny they are Iranian pawns and say their movement is a national revolution against corruption, control the north of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa. Saudi Arabia and its allies have been fighting on behalf of an exiled government with a foothold in the south. Read: Yemen workers held in dire conditions in Saudi prison Al-Malki accused Iran of providing the Houthis with ballistic capabilities and said the international community must "work together to combat this dangerous escalation" which threatened security in the region and beyond. At a press event in Riyadh, he displayed what he said were the remnants of a missile fired into Riyadh alongside an Iranian-manufactured Sayyad 2 missile he said had been part of a seized shipment on its way to Houthi fighters in Yemen. Independent UN experts reported to the Security Council in January that Houthi missiles they had examined and other military equipment had been manufactured in Iran. Last year, when the Houthis fired missiles at Riyadh which were intercepted, the Arab coalition responded by shutting Yemen's airports and ports. The United Nations said that blockade raised the prospect of mass starvation before it was partially lifted. Thousands of air strikes on Yemen, some of which have hit hospitals, schools and markets, killing hundreds of civilians, have brought the coalition little closer to military victory. Saudi Arabia has said hundreds of its own soldiers and civilians have been killed in Houthi mortar and short-range missile attacks across their rugged southern border. The United Nations says 10,000 people have died in the war, and three out of four Yemenis — 22 million civilians — need relief aid. More than 1 million cholera cases have been reported, the worst outbreak in modern history. Western countries have urged Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies to protect civilians and find a quick end to the war. But they also support Riyadh's argument that it needs to defend itself from cross border strikes and limit the spread of Iranian influence in territory overlooking important trade routes. The US Pentagon blamed Iran for exacerbating the conflict. "This follows Iran's pattern of providing advanced weapons to the Houthis," spokeswoman Lieutenant Commander Rebecca Rebarich said in a statement. "Iran has enabled the conflict in Yemen to spill into neighbouring countries and undermines international efforts to resolve the conflict, exacerbating the suffering of the Yemeni people." French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, appearing to refer to Iran, said in a statement that the transfer of missile capabilities to non-state actors that may be used against states is "irresponsible and contrary to law". Anwar Gargash, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, a Saudi military ally, tweeted: "The message of the Houthi-Iranian missiles is clear. There's no coexisting with a terrorist militia which threatens the stability of our region and is a proxy of Tehran." Qatar, which has been under months of sanctions from Arab countries including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, also condemned the attacks on Saudi cities as "a violation of international law".

 complementary.

The image shows the remnants of a missile that was fired into Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The missile was allegedly fired by the Houthi rebels, who are fighting against the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. The image is complementary to the news events set because it provides visual evidence of the attacks on Saudi Arabia, and it also highlights the role of Iran in supporting the Houthis. The image does not, however, reflect a specific event in the news events set.

News article:
Yemen's Houthi rebels launched a ballistic missile at the Saudi city of Jazan on Thursday evening that was intercepted by the kingdom's air defences before it could hit its target. Colonel Turki Al Malki, spokesman of the Saudi-led coalition forces in Yemen, said the missile was launched towards Jazan at 9.35pm from Saada province, a stronghold of the Iran-backed rebels, and was deliberately targeted at densely populated areas in the southern Saudi city. Col Al Malki said the attack was further evidence of Iran's arming of the Houthi militias, in violation of UN resolutions 2216 and 2231, with the aim of threatening the security of Saudi Arabia and the region, as well as international security. #المملكة_آمنة_قوية | #جازان_الآن بفضل من الله.. أبطالنا يقفون في وجه أي محاولات عدائية تستهدف أمننا 🇸🇦 pic.twitter.com/I6i0ERxQMn — وزارة الخارجية 🇸🇦 (@KSAMOFA) March 29, 2018 Launching ballistic missiles towards villages, cities and populated areas is considered a blatant breach of international humanitarian law, he said. Thursday's attack follows a Houthi missile barrage fired at Saudi Arabia on Sunday. All the missiles were shot down but one person was killed by falling debris in the capital, Riyadh. Col Al Malki said forensic examination of the wreckage of the missiles — three of which were aimed at Riyadh, two at Jazan, and one each at Najran and Khamis Mushait — proved that they were supplied by Iran. _______________ Read more: Iran provides Yemen’s Houthis material for explosives, report says UN Security Council condemns Houthi missile attacks on Saudi Arabia _______________

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi air defense forces intercepted a missile fired by Houthi fighters in neighboring Yemen at the southern Saudi city of Najran on Saturday, the Saudi-led coalition said. In a statement carried by state news agency SPA the coalition said that according to initial findings an Indian resident was injured by falling debris after the missile was intercepted. The Houthi-run Saba news agency earlier said a missile was fired at a Saudi National Guard base in Najran, and that it had led to "losses in the ranks of the enemy and its military equipment". The Iran-aligned Houthis have launched scores of missiles at the kingdom since the coalition intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 after the Houthis drove Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile. Last week, Saudi air defense forces intercepted a flurry of missiles, and falling debris caused the first death in the capital Riyadh. Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of supplying missile parts and expertise to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and other parts of the country. Tehran and the Houthis deny the charge.

News article:
An image grab from a video handed out by Huthi rebels shows what appears to be Huthi military forces launching a ballistic missile Saudi air defences intercepted a missile fired by Yemeni rebels at the kingdom's southern city of Najran on Saturday, the Saudi-led coalition fighting the rebels said, adding that one person was wounded. "The missile was fired at Najran indiscriminately and with the aim of hitting residential areas," coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki told the official Saudi Press Agency. "It was successfully intercepted and the debris fell on residential areas, lightly wounding one Indian expatriate." Yemen's Saba news agency, run by the Iran-backed Huthi rebels, said the missile had been fired at a Saudi National Guard base in Najran, just over the border from Yemen where the Saudi-led coalition intervened on the side of the government in March 2015. The coalition said on Thursday it intercepted another missile fired by the Huthis at the southern city of Jazan -- the latest in a series of such attacks that have drawn widespread condemnation. The coalition spokesman again hit out at Iran after Saturday's attack, accusing it of "jeopardising the security of Saudi Arabia, the region and the whole world." The UN Security Council this week condemned "in the strongest possible terms" multiple missile attacks launched by the Huthis on Saudi territory, saying they posed a threat to regional security. In one of the biggest such attacks yet, Saudi forces last weekend said they intercepted seven missiles fired by rebels toward cities including Riyadh, killing one person. The coalition intervened in Yemen to push back the Huthis who captured the capital Sanaa and forced the government into exile. Riyadh has accused arch-rival Tehran of providing the missiles and threatened retaliation against Iran. Tehran has denied making any arms deliveries and has said the Saudi accusations are a smokescreen intended to divert attention from its deadly bombing campaign against rebel-held areas, including Sanaa. Civilian casualties from coalition air strikes have drawn criticism from human rights groups, and in October the United Nations placed the coalition on a blacklist for killing and maiming children.

"The missile was fired at Najran indiscriminately and with the aim of hitting residential areas," coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki told the official Saudi Press Agency. "It was successfully intercepted and the debris fell on residential areas, lightly wounding one Indian expatriate." Yemen's Saba news agency, run by the Iran-backed Huthi rebels, said the missile had been fired at a Saudi National Guard base in Najran, just over the border from Yemen where the Saudi-led coalition intervened on the side of the government in March 2015. The coalition said on Thursday it intercepted another missile fired by the Huthis at the southern city of Jazan -- the latest in a series of such attacks that have drawn widespread condemnation. The coalition spokesman again hit out at Iran after Saturday's attack, accusing it of "jeopardising the security of Saudi Arabia, the region and the whole world." The UN Security Council this week condemned "in the strongest possible terms" multiple missile attacks launched by the Huthis on Saudi territory, saying they posed a threat to regional security. In one of the biggest such attacks yet, Saudi forces last weekend said they intercepted seven missiles fired by rebels toward cities including Riyadh, killing one person. The coalition intervened in Yemen to push back the Huthis who captured the capital Sanaa and forced the government into exile. Riyadh has accused arch-rival Tehran of providing the missiles and threatened retaliation against Iran. Tehran has denied making any arms deliveries and has said the Saudi accusations are a smokescreen intended to divert attention from its deadly bombing campaign against rebel-held areas, including Sanaa. Civilian casualties from coalition air strikes have drawn criticism from human rights groups, and in October the United Nations placed the coalition on a blacklist for killing and maiming children.

News article:
Why the Houthis have escalated the Yemen crisis Dr. Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg While the new UN Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths was on his first visit to Sana’a on March 25, Houthi militias fired seven ballistic missiles aimed at four Saudi cities — the largest number of missiles launched in one day since the beginning of the war. Later in the week, the Houthis fired more missiles at Saudi Arabia, and their statements indicated they intend to continue the missile attacks against Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Why the escalation? And why now? First, the Houthis wanted to nip Griffiths’ mission in the bud. With this escalation, they wanted to send a message to the UN that they have no plans to submit to the international will to disarm and dispose of their ballistic missile arsenal, as mandated by Security Council Resolution 2216. The resolution also bars other countries from supplying them with weapons, including ballistic missiles. The war has been a boon for the rebels. They have never been able to control such large swaths of Yemeni territory — about 20 percent of its total land. And through control of the government’s resources, such as taxes and fees, and profiteering in the black market, militia leaders have amassed large fortunes. Hodeidah port alone provides them with nearly a billion dollars annually in fees and other levies. The sanctions imposed on those leaders by the Security Council have not been implemented. Second, their patron and chief supporter, Iran, is facing pressure from the United States over the nuclear deal, its ballistic missile program, and its destabilizing activities in the region. It is in Iran’s interest to keep the pot boiling in Yemen to scuttle the renewed US efforts to confront its activities and renegotiate the nuclear deal. It thinks that, by showing resolve in Yemen, it can force the US to change course, as happened in Syria, for example. Third, the Houthi militias’ efforts to intimidate and blackmail the UN have been successful in the past because the UN thought it needed their cooperation to deliver badly needed aid in areas under their control. As such, the Houthis used the suffering of civilians to their advantage. By threatening to end cooperation in allowing the passage of aid, they cowed the UN into acquiescing to their belligerent tactics. By coinciding attacks with UN envoy’s first visit, rebels wanted to send a message that they have no plans to submit to the international will to disarm and dispose of their ballistic missile arsenal. Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg Fourth, the Houthis believed that the international community was not united in its determination to end their rebellion. Just a few days before they launched their March 25 missile volley against Saudi Arabia, the Houthis played host to several European diplomats, led by the European Union’s envoy to Yemen. The intentions of the diplomats aside, the Houthis touted the visit as a political victory. The fact that the European diplomats visited Yemen just before the new UN envoy did was seen by the Houthis as a clear demonstration that Europe had its own diplomatic channels that they could play against the UN. Since the conflict began, the EU’s diplomacy has unintentionally upstaged and undermined UN mediation efforts in the eyes of Yemeni rebels. In its attempts to woo the Houthis and convince them to reach a political compromise, the EU has provided the Houthis with the political and financial wherewithal to avoid dealing seriously with the UN. Thus, Houthi profiteering, Iran’s meddling, UN appeasement, and the EU’s alternative diplomacy are the four factors that appear to be derailing Griffiths’ first visit to Yemen. If the UN’s new special envoy is going to succeed, he has to be in charge of the mediation process. As representative of the UN secretary-general, he is responsible for bringing about a resolution to the conflict according to the terms of Resolution 2216, based on the GCC Initiative and its implementation mechanisms, and the outcomes of the Yemeni National Dialogue Conference. These key documents represent the international, regional and national consensus. Unless the Houthis are faced with the risk of losing their main sources of war profits, they may not ever come to the negotiating table to try and reach a political solution. Similarly, unless there are real consequences for its continued arming of the Houthis with ballistic missiles and other strategic weapons, Iran will continue to frustrate UN mediation. Without unity among the international community, including Europe, Griffiths’ mission is in danger, just as the previous UN envoy was undermined by differences within the international community. Fortunately for Yemen, and despite the missile attacks and the lack of progress on the political track, Saudi Arabia announced that it was going ahead with its previously announced humanitarian assistance plans. On March 28, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres witnessed the signing in New York of an agreement whereby Saudi Arabia and the UAE will provide $1 billion, or about 33 percent of the total cost of the 2018 UN Humanitarian Response Plan for Yemen. On Tuesday, an international conference will be held in Geneva to mobilize the funds needed to cover the remaining two-thirds of the money. The UN plan will provide urgently needed assistance in Yemen, including in the areas under rebel control. The conference is also important in that it could demonstrate international unity in facing the humanitarian disaster in Yemen and single out the main culprits in perpetuating that crisis, the Houthi militias.

News article:
DUBAI/GENEVA (Reuters) - Yemen’s Houthi group hit a Saudi oil tanker off the main port city of Hodeidah on Tuesday, the Saudi-led coalition said, in an attack that could complicate a new United Nations push to end a war that has killed more than 10,000 people. The Iranian-aligned Houthis said they had targeted a coalition warship in response to an air strike on Hodeidah on Monday that killed at least a dozen civilians, including seven children. Tensions have been rising in recent days after the Houthis, who control most of northern Yemen, launched a series of missile strikes on Saudi Arabia, including the capital Riyadh, in recent days. In a statement carried by Saudi media, the coalition said the oil tanker was in international waters when it came under “Houthi-Iranian attack” at around 1330 local time (1030 GMT). A coalition warship conducted a “swift intervention” foiling the attack, it said, without identifying the type of weapon used in the assault. “As a result of that attack, the tanker was subjected to a slight but ineffective hit and it resumed its naval course northwards, escorted by a coalition warship,” the statement said. A European Union naval force that operates in the region confirmed the ship was underway, adding that the crew were safe and unharmed. The media department of the Houthi-run Yemeni military said naval forces had “targeted a battleship belonging to the coalition in response to the bombardment of displaced people in Hodeidah”. It gave no further details. The department’s text message was referring to an air strike by the Saudi-led coalition on Monday in Houthi-controlled Hodeidah that destroyed a house and killed 12 civilians from the same family, including seven children. A coalition spokesman said the alliance takes the report very seriously, promising a full investigation. Last week, Saudi air defences intercepted a flurry of missiles, and falling debris caused the first death in the capital Riyadh. Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of supplying missiles to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and other parts of the country. Tehran and the Houthis deny the charge. CALL FOR ENDING WAR Earlier on Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the warring sides in Yemen to reach a political settlement to end a conflict now in its fourth year that has left 22 million people in urgent need of aid. Speaking in Geneva on the sidelines of a U.N. pledging conference for Yemen, Guterres said his Special Envoy Martin Griffiths will head to the United Arab Emirates, Oman and the Yemeni government-held city of Aden in the drive for peace, Guterres told reporters. Griffiths has already held talks with Houthi authorities as well as internationally-recognised Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and Saudi officials in Riyadh. Guterres said he saw “positive perspectives” for preparing a plan of action “to lead to an effective inter-Yemeni dialogue able to achieve a political solution, with of course the involvement of all those that are relevant in this conflict”. “I am optimistic about that possibility,” the United Nations chief added. He announced that more than $2 billion has been pledged towards a U.N. humanitarian appeal of $3 billion for Yemen this year. It includes $930 million from Saudi Arabia and the UAE which lead the coalition air strikes. Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdel-Malek al-Mekhlafi called for a return to the negotiating table to end the war in the Arabian peninsula’s poorest country and said his government was working to open blockaded ports and airports to aid.

News article:
Yemen's Houthi group hit a Saudi oil tanker off the main port city of Hodeidah on Tuesday, the Saudi-led coalition said, in an attack that could complicate a new United Nations push to end a war that has killed more than 10,000 people. The Iranian-aligned Houthis said they had targeted a coalition warship in response to an air strike on Hodeidah on Monday that killed at least a dozen civilians, including seven children. Tensions have been rising in recent days after the Houthis, who control most of northern Yemen, launched a series of missile strikes on Saudi Arabia, including the capital Riyadh, in recent days. In a statement carried by Saudi media, the coalition said the oil tanker was in international waters when it came under "Houthi-Iranian attack" at around 1330 local time (1030 GMT). A coalition warship conducted a "swift intervention" foiling the attack, it said, without identifying the type of weapon used in the assault. "As a result of that attack, the tanker was subjected to a slight but ineffective hit and it resumed its naval course northwards, escorted by a coalition warship," the statement said. A European Union naval force that operates in the region confirmed the ship was underway, adding that the crew were safe and unharmed. The media department of the Houthi-run Yemeni military said naval forces had "targeted a battleship belonging to the coalition in response to the bombardment of displaced people in Hodeidah". It gave no further details. The department's text message was referring to an air strike by the Saudi-led coalition on Monday in Houthi-controlled Hodeidah that destroyed a house and killed 12 civilians from the same family, including seven children. A coalition spokesman said the alliance takes the report very seriously, promising a full investigation. Last week, Saudi air defences intercepted a flurry of missiles, and falling debris caused the first death in the capital Riyadh. Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of supplying missiles to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and other parts of the country. Tehran and the Houthis deny the charge. CALL FOR ENDING WAR Earlier on Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the warring sides in Yemen to reach a political settlement to end a conflict now in its fourth year that has left 22 million people in urgent need of aid. Speaking in Geneva on the sidelines of a U.N. pledging conference for Yemen, Guterres said his Special Envoy Martin Griffiths will head to the United Arab Emirates, Oman and the Yemeni government-held city of Aden in the drive for peace, Guterres told reporters. Griffiths has already held talks with Houthi authorities as well as internationally-recognised Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and Saudi officials in Riyadh. Guterres said he saw "positive perspectives" for preparing a plan of action "to lead to an effective inter-Yemeni dialogue able to achieve a political solution, with of course the involvement of all those that are relevant in this conflict". "I am optimistic about that possibility," the United Nations chief added. He announced that more than $2 billion has been pledged towards a U.N. humanitarian appeal of $3 billion for Yemen this year. It includes $930 million from Saudi Arabia and the UAE which lead the coalition air strikes. Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdel-Malek al-Mekhlafi called for a return to the negotiating table to end the war in the Arabian peninsula's poorest country and said his government was working to open blockaded ports and airports to aid.

A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, Turki Al-Maliki, accused Houthi rebels on Tuesday of attacking a Saudi Arabian oil tanker in the Red Sea. According to the official Saudi Press Agency, Al-Maliki said that the tanker suffered minor damage but was able to continue on its northwards course towards Saudi territorial waters escorted by a coalition warship. The spokesman said that the "Houthi-Iranian" attack took place at 13:30 local time while the tanker was sailing in international waters west of the port of Hodeida. "The attempted attack failed, after a coalition warship implemented a swift intervention," Al-Maliki explained. Such a "terrorist attack," he added, "poses a serious threat to freedom of shipping and international trade in the Bab Al-Mandab Strait and the Red Sea. It could also cause environmental and economic damage." Read: Houthis target Saudi oil tanker off Yemen Al-Maliki pointed out that the coalition forces led by Riyadh will continue to adopt and implement all measures and means to preserve security and stability and ensure freedom of navigation and international trade in the region. The Houthis did not respond to the coalition allegation.

News article:
RIYADH (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said on Wednesday that Saudi Arabia’s air defense had intercepted a missile that the armed Houthi movement said it fired at storage tanks belonging to Saudi Aramco oil company. Debris fell on residential areas when the missile, launched towards the southwestern Saudi Arabian port of Jizan, was destroyed around 2130 (1830 GMT) but there were no reported casualties or damage, coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said. Aramco said on Twitter that all its facilities in Jizan were safe and operating normally. Tensions have risen in recent days after the Houthis, who control most of northern Yemen, launched a series of missile strikes on Saudi Arabia which the coalition said were intercepted. Falling debris killed one person in Riyadh, the first death in the Saudi capital from the Yemen war. Saudi Arabia accuses arch-rival Iran of supplying missiles to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and other parts of the country. Tehran and the Houthis deny the allegation. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened against the Houthis in Yemen’s war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The United Nations says 10,000 people have died in the fighting.

Debris fell on residential areas when the missile, launched towards the southwestern Saudi Arabian port of Jizan, was destroyed around 2130 (1830 GMT) but there were no reported casualties or damage, coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said. Aramco said on Twitter that all its facilities in Jizan were safe and operating normally. Tensions have risen in recent days after the Houthis, who control most of northern Yemen, launched a series of missile strikes on Saudi Arabia which the coalition said were intercepted. Falling debris killed one person in Riyadh, the first death in the Saudi capital from the Yemen war. Saudi Arabia accuses arch-rival Iran of supplying missiles to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and other parts of the country. Tehran and the Houthis deny the allegation. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened against the Houthis in Yemen’s war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The United Nations says 10,000 people have died in the fighting.

The Saudi-led military coalition said Thursday it shot down a missile fired by Yemen's Shia Houthi rebels who said they targeted storage facilities of the kingdom's oil giant Aramco. "The missile fired at the town of Jizan was intercepted and destroyed" late Wednesday, said coalition spokesman Turki al-Maliki. "The debris fell on residential areas and we have no report of human losses or material damage," he said. Aramco said its facilities in Jizan, in southwestern Saudi Arabia, were "intact" and operating normally, after pictures were posted on social media of a fire sparked by a missile attack. The Houthi rebels said on their Al-Masirah television channel they had targeted Aramco storage tanks in Jizan. Saudi Arabia leads a regional military coalition allied with Yemen's embattled government in a war against the Iran-backed Houthis, who have ramped up their attacks on the kingdom. An Egyptian labourer was killed by falling debris from a March 25 missile attack on Riyadh. *This story was edited by Ahram Online. Search Keywords: Short link:

Colonel Turki al-Maliki, spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, addresses a news conference in Riyadh on March 26, 2018. Faisal Al Nasser / Reuters Asharq Al-Awsat Saudi air defense forces have intercepted and destroyed a ballistic missile fired by Yemen's Houthi insurgents at the Saudi city of Najran, the Coalition supporting Yemen's legitimate government said on Friday. Coalition spokesman Turki al-Maliki said the missile was launched randomly from Yemen’s Saada province. The missile intended to target civilian and populated areas, he stated. When intercepted and destroyed, the debris fell on residential areas but there was no report of human losses or material damage, he added. Maliki reiterated that the Houthis’ hostile action is evidence of the Iranian regime’s support to the armed insurgents in violation of Security Council Resolutions 2216 and 2231.

News article:
A Saudi soldier from an artillery unit walks near ammunition at a position close to the Saudi-Yemeni border, in Saudi Arabia's southwestern Jazan province. (AFP) Asharq Al-Awsat The Arab coalition to support legitimacy in Yemen announced on Wednesday that the Saudi air defense system intercepted two drones sent by the Houthi militias from Yemeni territories, reported the Saudi Press Agency. Coalition spokesman Colonel Turki Al-Malki said that the drones were downed in the southern cities of Abha and Jazan. In a statement, he explained that the air defense system detected at 07:40 am an unidentified body flying towards Abha International Airport. It quickly destroyed it due to the rules of engagement. Air navigation was closed soon after in accordance with the global aviation laws. It was resumed shortly after. Malki announced that specialists from the Arab coalition examined the fragments of the body and found that it was a Houthi drone with Iranian features and specifications. He accused them of trying to target the airport in violation of International Humanitarian Law. In Jazan, he said that an unidentified body was flown towards a civilian area in the city. It was monitored and later destroyed by the air defense. No casualties were reported in the incident. Immediate tests conducted by specialists revealed that the body of the drone was identical to the one downed in Abha. The Arab coalition warned in the strongest terms the Iran-backed Houthis against targeting civilian areas and people, saying that a retaliation is justified. The command will take all deterrent actions in accordance with International Humanitarian Law and rules, Malki said. Arms monitor Conflict Armament Research said it has evidence that the drones used on Wednesday and other Houthi kit were made in Iran and was not of indigenous design and construction “in contrast to Houthi statements”.

News article:
(Adds details on Jizan refinery in para 4) DUBAI, April 11 (Reuters) - Yemen's armed Houthi movement said on Wednesday it had launched a drone strike on a facility belonging to oil giant Saudi Aramco in southern Saudi Arabia - though the company said its facilities there were operating "normally and safely". The Houthis' Al-Masirah TV channel did not say when the attack took place or give details of any damage. "The air force announced the execution of air strikes with the Qasef-1 aircraft on Aramco in Jizan (province)," the channel said on its Twitter account, referring to a drone the Houthis unveiled last year. Saudi Aramco is building a 400,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Jizan, part of a new economic city on the Red Sea. The refinery is expected to become fully operational in 2019. Al-Masirah said the Houthis had also launched an attack with the same model of drone on the airport of Abha in neighbouring Asir province. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab states intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 to try and push back the Houthis after the movement drove the internationally recognized government into Saudi exile. The coalition has launched thousands of air strikes which have hit schools, markets and hospitals, killing hundreds of people - though it says it does not target civilians. The Houthis have stepped up ballistic missile attacks on the kingdom in what it says is retaliation for the air raids. They have frequently claimed attacks, including on Aramco facilities, that Saudi Arabia and its main ally the United Arab Emirates have either said did not happen or were intercepted. The group unveiled what it said was a series of drones, including the Qasef-1, at a ceremony last year. The arms monitor Conflict Armament Research (CAR) said it had evidence showing the Qasef-1 and other Houthi kit was made in Iran and was not of indigenous design and construction "in contrast to Houthi statements". The coalition accuses the Houthis of being armed and supported by Iran - charges the group and Tehran deny.

News article:
Saudi soldiers take their position at Saudi Arabia's border with Yemen. (Reuters) Washington, Riyadh – Atef Abdul Latif and Asharq Al-Awsat Saudi air defenses intercepted on Thursday night a new ballistic missile fired by the Iran-backed Houthis towards the Kingdom. Official spokesman for Coalition Forces Supporting Legitimacy in Yemen Colonel Turki Al-Malki said that the missile was launched by the militias in Yemen’s Saada province and targeted residential areas in the city of Jizan in southern Saudi Arabia. The missile was was intercepted and destroyed by the Royal Saudi Air Defense Forces, resulting in the scattering of its shrapnel debris on residential neighborhoods. There were no reports of any casualties or damage. The failed attempt to target Jizan coincided with the flow of Arab and international condemnation of the Houthis, who on Wednesday fired missiles against Saudi cities. All of the rockets were intercepted by air defenses. The United States State Department condemned the attack, saying the Kingdom has the right to defend its borders against the militias. The attack, it said, raises questions on just how committed the Houthis are towards achieving peace and building a secure and prosperous future for Yemen. Director of the Center for Gulf Affairs at the Middle East Institute Gerald Feierstein told Asharq Al-Awsat that the Houthis were using such attacks against Saudi Arabia to embarrass it before its own people. They are attempting to demonstrate that the Saudi armed forces were incapable of protecting their borders and territories, he continued. The arms used by the Houthis in their attacks cannot really achieve real military purposes because they lack the means to target vital infrastructure, he went on to say. He stressed that the US must continue to support Saudi Arabia and the Arab Coalition in their efforts to restore legitimacy in Yemen and prevent the Houthis from taking over the country. Feierstein said that Washington supports the Saudi-led Coalition’s goal to implement United Nations Security Council resolution 2216 on Yemen. Secretary General of the Gulf Cooperation Council Dr. Abdullatif bin Rashid Al-Zayani condemned Wednesday’s terrorist ballistic missile attack by the Houthis against the Saudi capital Riyadh and cities of Jizan and Najran. The continuation of such attacks demonstrates the militias’ insistence to threaten the security of Saudi Arabia and their rejection of regional and international efforts to stop the bloodshed and achieve peace in Yemen. He hailed the efficiency of the Royal Saudi Air Defense Forces, which intercepted and destroyed the missiles before they reached their targets. He called on the international community to condemn these hostile acts that violate international laws and conventions, urging the Security Council to implement its resolutions on Yemen, including resolution 2216. Britain also expressed deep concern after the ballistic missile attacks by the Houthis against Saudi cities, stressing that it stands with Saudi Arabia against these serious threats. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said in a statement: "We will call on the UN to investigate how ballistic weapons reach Yemen in violation of Security Council resolutions." "Those responsible for firing these missiles and their supporters must stop these provocative acts and return to political dialogue to ensure an end to the conflict in Yemen for the benefit of the Yemeni people and ensure the security of the region," he added. Egypt strongly condemned the Houthi attack. The Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday that it fully support Saudi Arabia in confronting all who attempt to destabilize or threaten its security.

News article:
Al Arabiya has learned on Tuesday from sources that Arab Coalition forces were able to shoot down two Iranian drone aircrafts in the Midi district of Hajjah province. The Houthi militias reportedly launched the Iran-made drones a day earlier to the positions of the national army and coalition in the recently liberated directorate of Midi in order to surveil and reveal military positions. Advertisement Sources said that the Houthi militias tried to repeat the operation Monday morning but did not succeed, after a second one was shot down by army and coalition forces.

News article:
Al Mukalla: UAE-backed Yemeni Security Belt forces have killed two senior Al Qaida militants in the southern province of Abyan, scoring another victory in the battle against the militant group. Hassan Basaria and Murad Doubali were killed in an intense gun battle after refusing to surrender in Al Wadhea district, the birthplace of Yemen’s president Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi, the security unit said in a statement. They had been involved in plotting attacks against local security forces. Al Qaida has largely failed to resurface in their former strongholds as thousands of Yemeni troops, trained and armed by the UAE military in Yemen, assert control over key urban and rural areas in southern Yemen. Meanwhile, Saudi-led coalition fighter jets have killed an Al Houthi navy commander responsible for smuggling arms and staging attacks against ships in the Red Sea. Yemen Defence Ministry said on Wednesday that coalition fighter jets targeted a gathering of Al Houthi militants in the western port city of Hodeida, killing Mansour Ahmad Al Sa’adi and a number of his associates. Al Sa’adi was described as an important Al Houthi smuggler and a commander of the movement’s navy soldiers who plotted attacks against military and humanitarian ships from the USA, UAE and Saudi Arabia. The death of Al Sa’adi comes as the Iran-backed militia officially mourned the death of brigadier Nasser Al Qubari, a former Republican Guard, killed in an air strike by the coalition jets on Wednesday. Precision air raids by the coalition’s fighter jets have killed dozens of Al Houthi commanders, including military aides to Al Houthi leader, Abdul Malik Al Houthi. The Saudi-led coalition has intensified their ground and air offensive in the province of Hodeida in an attempt to cut off the remaining smuggling routes on the Red Sea under Al Houthi control. Meanwhile, Yemen’s Defence Ministry mourned the death of Colonel Ali Abdullah Al Suaidi, the commander of Brigade 159, who was killed in clashes with Al Houthi militants on Al Abadia battlefield, east of the central province of Baydha. Another pro-government field commander, Mohammad Jawas, was killed after attacking Al Houthi-controlled sites in Al Shareja, north of Lahj province. The Defence Ministry said coalition fighter jets carried out dozens of air strikes in Taiz and Serwah, Baydha and Sa’ada, striking Al Houthi military equipment and gatherings and killing dozens of militants. The coalition massive air support is credited for turning the tide of the current war in favour of government forces. The Saudi-led Arab coalition entered the Yemeni war in 2015 just months after an Al Houthi coup forced internationally-recognised Yemeni president Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi out of power. He later was able to escape house arrest and flee to Aden where he temporarily shifted government headquarters. Since then, the coalition has gained back 86 per cent of Yemeni territory but major population centres still remain under Al Houthi control. Saudi Arabia and the US have accused Iran of illegally smuggling weapons into Yemen to sustain Al Houthi war efforts. In December, one such Iranian-made ballistic missile was fired towards Riyadh for the first time in the three-year war. Although it was intercepted, Riyadh called it an ‘act of war’. The war has cost the lives of thousands of Yemenis and pushed the Arab world’s poorest country to the brink of famine. The latest government push seeks to take advantage of cracks in the awkward Al Houthi alliance with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s supporters. Saleh ruled Yemen for more than three decades until he was forced to resign following an Arab Spring uprising in 2011. He remained in the country, however, and continued to wield power from behind the scenes. In 2014, his forces allied with Al Houthi militia, despite the fact that as president he had gone to war with them. There had been simmering tensions between the two awkward allies in past months that boiled over in December when Saleh suggested he would cooperate with Hadi — he was assassinated shortly after. Since then senior members of Saleh’s party have either been executed or placed under house arrest by Al Houthis amid a draconion crackdown. The broken alliance between Al Houthis and forces loyal to Saleh appears to be permanent, which will help the Yemeni government and its backers in the Saudi-led coalition weaken their grip on the country given the reduction in manpower. In a recent meeting with New York Times editors, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman said that Al Houthis have become increasingly isolated politically. He dismissed the seven missiles Al Houthis fired at Saudi Arabia from Yemen on March 25 as “a last-ditch effort” that only showed they were weak. Saudi Arabia, he said, is now seeking to end the war through a political process, trying to divide Al Houthis and maintaining military pressure on them.

News article:
Saudi air defences intercepted a "ballistic missile" fired by Yemeni rebels at the kingdom's southern coastal city of Jizan, the Saudi-led coalition fighting the rebels said. It was the latest in a series of such attacks. "Saudi air defences intercepted a ballistic missile launched by the Huthi militias targeting Jizan," the coalition said in a statement. The Huthis, in a statement on their news outlet Al-Masirah, claimed that they fired a "Badr 1" ballistic missile and said it struck Jizan Regional Airport.

Riyadh (AFP) - Saudi air defences on Sunday intercepted a ballistic missile fired by Yemeni rebels at the kingdom's southern border city of Najran, which set a farm ablaze, state media said. "Saudi forces were able to intercept (the missile)," the Saudi Press Agency said, citing the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed Huthi rebels. "But the shrapnel scattered over residential areas and caused a fire at a farm belonging to a citizen, without causing any injuries." The missile was launched from Saada, the Huthi stronghold in northern Yemen, the coalition was cited as saying. The coalition said another missile crashed in a Saudi desert on Sunday, without specifying a location, adding it caused no damage. Sunday's strikes are the latest in a series of rebel bombardments on Saudi territory. Saudi forces said they intercepted a rebel ballistic missile targeting kingdom's southern coastal city of Jizan on Friday, the second such strike in the area in over a week. Earlier this month, Saudi forces said they intercepted rebel ballistic missiles fired at Riyadh and the south of the kingdom, where two drones were also shot down. Saudi Arabia has since March 2015 led a coalition of Arab states fighting to roll back the Huthis in Yemen and restore its neighbour's internationally recognised government to power. Nearly 10,000 people have since been killed in the conflict, in what the United Nations has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis. In March, an Egyptian labourer became the first known fatality in a rebel missile attack on the Saudi capital. Saudi Arabia accuses its arch-rival Iran of smuggling missiles to the Huthis -- a charge Tehran denies.

(Adds Houthi leader speech) By Noah Browning DUBAI, April 28 (Reuters) - Yemen's Houthi movement fired ballistic missiles at what it called "economic and vital targets" in the southern Saudi province of Jizan on Saturday, and Saudi authorities said a man was killed by debris from the projectiles. The attack appeared to be retaliation promised by Yemen's dominant political faction in a war there as thousands attended a funeral in the Houthi-run capital Sanaa for a top Houthi official killed in a Saudi-led air strike last week. Eyewitnesses in Sanaa reported Saudi-led air raids on Saturday near the downtown rally for the burial of Saleh al-Samad, the president of the political body that runs Houthi-controlled northern Yemen. There were no reports of casualties. The Houthis said they launched eight ballistic missiles at "economic and vital targets" in Saudi's Jizan province on Saturday. Riyadh said it intercepted four of the projectiles. Jizan civil defence spokesman Colonel Yahya Abdullah Al-Qahtani said on Arabiya TV that the Saudi man was killed by "falling fragments of military projectiles." A picture accompanying the Arabiya TV report appeared to show the outside of a civilian home pockmarked by shrapnel. The two sides in Yemen have fought to a stalemate after more than three years of war. A Saudi-led military coalition is trying to restore Yemen's internationally recognised government that was forced into exile after the Houthis took over large parts of the country in 2014 and seized the capital Sanaa. Saudi and other warplanes from the mostly Gulf Arab alliance have carried out thousands of air strikes, repeatedly hitting markets, hospitals and other civilian targets, killing hundreds of civilians. The coalition says it does not target civilians. In a televised speech, Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi vowed that the death of Samad -- a relative moderate who helped oversee political and administrative duties while the Houthi military wing pursued fighting -- would not split its ranks. "They anticipated that this crime would break the spirit of the Yemeni people ... Our enemies have fantasized that the assassination of the president will lead to disagreements within the Ansarullah (Houthis). All this is a mirage and illusions." The Houthis have fired more than 100 ballistic missiles into the kingdom, causing few casualties, but fuelling accusations by their adversaries and the United States that Iran is providing the missiles to their Houthi allies. Tehran and the Houthis deny the accusation. The group says it is fighting for Yemen's sovereignty against a Western-backed plot to dominate the country.

(Adds Houthi leader speech) By Noah Browning DUBAI, April 28 (Reuters) - Yemen's Houthi movement fired ballistic missiles at what it called "economic and vital targets" in the southern Saudi province of Jizan on Saturday, and Saudi authorities said a man was killed by debris from the projectiles. The attack appeared to be retaliation promised by Yemen's dominant political faction in a war there as thousands attended a funeral in the Houthi-run capital Sanaa for a top Houthi official killed in a Saudi-led air strike last week. Eyewitnesses in Sanaa reported Saudi-led air raids on Saturday near the downtown rally for the burial of Saleh al-Samad, the president of the political body that runs Houthi-controlled northern Yemen. There were no reports of casualties. The Houthis said they launched eight ballistic missiles at "economic and vital targets" in Saudi's Jizan province on Saturday. Riyadh said it intercepted four of the projectiles. Jizan civil defence spokesman Colonel Yahya Abdullah Al-Qahtani said on Arabiya TV that the Saudi man was killed by "falling fragments of military projectiles." A picture accompanying the Arabiya TV report appeared to show the outside of a civilian home pockmarked by shrapnel. The two sides in Yemen have fought to a stalemate after more than three years of war. A Saudi-led military coalition is trying to restore Yemen's internationally recognised government that was forced into exile after the Houthis took over large parts of the country in 2014 and seized the capital Sanaa. Saudi and other warplanes from the mostly Gulf Arab alliance have carried out thousands of air strikes, repeatedly hitting markets, hospitals and other civilian targets, killing hundreds of civilians. The coalition says it does not target civilians. In a televised speech, Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi vowed that the death of Samad -- a relative moderate who helped oversee political and administrative duties while the Houthi military wing pursued fighting -- would not split its ranks. "They anticipated that this crime would break the spirit of the Yemeni people ... Our enemies have fantasized that the assassination of the president will lead to disagreements within the Ansarullah (Houthis). All this is a mirage and illusions." The Houthis have fired more than 100 ballistic missiles into the kingdom, causing few casualties, but fuelling accusations by their adversaries and the United States that Iran is providing the missiles to their Houthi allies. Tehran and the Houthis deny the accusation. The group says it is fighting for Yemen's sovereignty against a Western-backed plot to dominate the country.

News article:
Al Mukalla: Yemen’s army and Saudi-led coalition explosive sappers have defused more than 300,000 landmines and booby traps planted by the Iran-backed Al Houthis who suffer heavy setbacks on the battlefields. The director of Yemen’s Mine Action Centre, Brigadier General Amen Al Oukaili, said Al Houthis have planted more than 500,000 landmines before fleeing areas liberated by Yemeni troops during the course of the three-year war. Remaining landmines continue to pose a grave threat to civilians who return to their homes. 440 Yemenis have been killed by landmines The aim of leaving behind the landmines is to slow down government forces as they advance on the battlefield. Yemen’s under-secretary of the ministry of human rights, Majed Fadhael, was quoted by Saudi news agency as saying that Al Houthi-planted landmines have killed 440 people, mainly women and children and wounded more than 540 others. Last year, Human Right Watch criticised Al Houthis for using landmines which are banned because of their indiscrminate killing and maiming of civilians. Many Yemenis fear to return home because of the fear of stepping on a landmine which has kept the numbers of internally-displaced Yemenis high. On Tuesday, Al Masdar Online news site reported a woman and her child were killed when a landmine planted by Al Houthis exploded in the southern city of Taiz. Sabah Sultan, 30 and her child Ali Mouath, 6, were getting water from a water tanker when a landmine that was planted behind the tanker exploded, killing them instantly in Hathran region, west of Taiz. Meanwhile, on the battlefield, fighter jets from the Saudi-led coalition escalated attacks against Al Houthi targets, west of Taiz, in support of thousands of army troops, led Tareq Mohammad Abdullah Saleh. Yemen’s Defense Ministry said the coalition’s fighter jets bombed Al Houthi military equipment and gatherings in areas east of the Red Sea Mokha town as Tareq’s forces push deeper into Al Houthis’ shrinking territories in Taiz. The ministry said the air strikes killed and wounded a number of Al Houthis and enabled ground forces to make limited advances in their push towards Al Bareh town. Heavy fighting also broke out on Wednesday in the northeastern province of Saada, Al Houthis’ main heartland, where government forces made fresh gains that brought them closer to reaching Marran region, the birthplace of Al Houthi movement founder Hussain Al Houthi. Local military commanders say government forces are battling Al Houthis on five fronts in Saada in a bid to cut off supply lines from and to Saada and erode their military power that protects Saada. The Saudi-led Arab coalition entered the Yemeni war in 2015 just months after an Al Houthi coup forced internationally-recognised Yemeni president Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi out of power. 540 Yemenis wounded by landmines He later was able to escape house arrest and flee to Aden where he temporarily shifted government headquarters. Since then, the coalition has gained back 86 per cent of Yemeni territory but major population centres still remain under Al Houthi control. Saudi Arabia and the US have accused Iran of illegally smuggling weapons into Yemen to sustain Al Houthi war efforts. In December, one such Iranian-made ballistic missile was fired towards Riyadh for the first time in the three-year war. Although it was intercepted, Riyadh called it an ‘act of war’. The war has cost the lives of thousands of Yemenis and pushed the Arab world’s poorest country to the brink of famine. The latest government push seeks to take advantage of cracks in the awkward Al Houthi alliance with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s supporters. Saleh ruled Yemen for more than three decades until he was forced to resign following an Arab Spring uprising in 2011. He remained in the country, however, and continued to wield power from behind the scenes. In 2014, his forces allied with Al Houthi militia, despite the fact that as president he had gone to war with them. There had been simmering tensions between the two awkward allies in past months that boiled over in December when Saleh suggested he would cooperate with Hadi — he was assassinated shortly after. Since then senior members of Saleh’s party have either been executed or placed under house arrest by Al Houthis amid a draconion crackdown. The broken alliance between Al Houthis and forces loyal to Saleh appears to be permanent, which will help the Yemeni government and its backers in the Saudi-led coalition weaken their grip on the country given the reduction in manpower. In a recent meeting with New York Times editors, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman said that Al Houthis have become increasingly isolated politically. He dismissed the seven missiles Al Houthis fired at Saudi Arabia from Yemen on March 25 as “a last-ditch effort” that only showed they were weak. Saudi Arabia, he said, is now seeking to end the war through a political process, trying to divide Al Houthis and maintaining military pressure on them.

Since then senior members of Saleh’s party have either been executed or placed under house arrest by Al Houthis amid a draconion crackdown. The broken alliance between Al Houthis and forces loyal to Saleh appears to be permanent, which will help the Yemeni government and its backers in the Saudi-led coalition weaken their grip on the country given the reduction in manpower. In a recent meeting with New York Times editors, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman said that Al Houthis have become increasingly isolated politically. He dismissed the seven missiles Al Houthis fired at Saudi Arabia from Yemen on March 25 as “a last-ditch effort” that only showed they were weak. Saudi Arabia, he said, is now seeking to end the war through a political process, trying to divide Al Houthis and maintaining military pressure on them.

News article:
The Saudi-led coalition, consisting mostly of Persian Gulf countries, has been carrying out airstrikes against the Houthi movement since March 2015, when the rebels conducted a takeover in the country, which resulted in President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi fleeing Sanaa, Yemen's capital. The Houthis, allied with ex-President Ali Abdullah Saleh, clashed with Hadi's forces, with each side claiming to be the official government. The coalition led by Saudi Arabia denounced the Houthi takeover as unconstitutional and since then has been attempting to restore the government of Hadi. READ MORE: Saudi Air Defenses Down Yemeni Rebel Missile — Reports The military conflict in Yemen has further escalated since November 2017 when Saudi Arabia accused Iran of supplying the Houthi rebels with ballistic missiles and imposed a blockade on Yemen in order to prevent the transfer of military goods to the Houthis. While Tehran has made no secret of its political support for the Shiite movement, it has repeatedly denied rumors of arming the Yemeni rebels. While Riyadh has insisted that the closure of Yemen's ground, air and sea ports by the Saudi-led coalition forces would not interfere with food deliveries to the country, the UN said that the blockade distorted the supply of humanitarian aid, which along with the destruction of the country's infrastructure, as a result of the fighting, has led to a massive famine.

An air strike targeted the office of the presidency in Yemen's rebel-held capital Sanaa on Monday. The strike came hours after Saudi Arabia's air defenses intercepted two ballistic missiles launched by the Houthis that targeted the south of the kingdom, coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said. Advertisement He said the rockets were launched from northern Yemen toward "populated areas" of Saudi Arabia, but were intercepted overnight without any casualties or damage. "This hostile act... proves the continued involvement of the Iranian regime in supporting the Huthi militia with qualitative capabilities," Malki added. Since November of last year, the Iran-backed insurgents have intensified missile attacks into neighboring Saudi Arabia. The Saudi-led coalition launched a military intervention in Yemen in 2015 with the goal of rolling back the Houthis and restoring the internationally-recognized government to power. (With AFP)

The rebels quickly claimed responsibility for attacking “Riyadh Dry Port and other economic targets” in the Saudi capital with Burkan 2H ballistic missiles.

Colonel Turki Al Maliki, said that at 10.18am on Monday, the Saudi Royal Air Defence Forces started tracking a ballistic missile launched by Al Houthi militia. The missile was launched from Saada governorate to deliberately target civilian objects, he added. “Launching a ballistic missile towards densely populated areas by the Iranian-backed Houthi militia is yet another violation of international humanitarian law, and proves continued Iranian involvement in the Yemeni conflict,” he said in a statement relayed by the Riyadh-based Centre for International Communication. “Iran is supporting Al Houthis with advanced military capabilities, in a clear and explicit violation of UN Security Council Resolutions 2216 and 2231, in order to threaten the security of Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, and the stability of the international order.”

The Houthis, an Iran-allied group that holds much of Yemen including the capital Sanaa, have fired a series of missiles into the kingdom in recent months, part of a three-year-old conflict in Yemen widely seen as a proxy battle between Saudi Arabia and Iran. A U.S.-backed military alliance intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 to fight against the Houthis on behalf of the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour al-Hadi, who lives in exile in Riyadh. Iran and the Houthis dismiss Saudi accusations that Tehran arms the group. Coalition spokesman Turki al-Malki said Saudi air defence forces had tracked the rocket but that it landed in an uninhabited area, according to a report from the official Saudi Press Agency. The Houthis fired a salvo of missiles at Riyadh last week, with one falling short of the capital and another intercepted by Saudi air defence forces, Malki said at the time.

(Adds coalition statement, context) RIYADH, May 14 (Reuters) - Yemen's armed Houthi movement launched a ballistic missile at a Saudi Aramco facility in Saudi Arabia's southwestern Jizan province on Monday, the group's al-Masirah TV reported, but a Saudi-led coalition said the rocket fell in the open desert. The Houthis, an Iran-allied group that holds much of Yemen including the capital Sanaa, have fired a series of missiles into the kingdom in recent months, part of a three-year-old conflict in Yemen widely seen as a proxy battle between Saudi Arabia and Iran. A U.S.-backed military alliance intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 to fight against the Houthis on behalf of the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour al-Hadi, who lives in exile in Riyadh. Iran and the Houthis dismiss Saudi accusations that Tehran arms the group.

News article:
Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi – Reuters CAIRO – 2 April 2018: Yemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi expressed his wishes of progress and success in a cable sent on Monday to his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fatah al-Sisi after winning a second term. Hadi asserted that his country shares deep-rooted and strong relations with Egypt, expressing his hope for more cooperation in various fields. In a press conference on Monday, the National Election Authority announced the victory of Sisi over Ghad Party Chairman Moussa Moustafa Moussa in the 2018 presidential election. President Sisi garnered 97.08 percent of valid votes in the presidential election last week, where more than 21.8 million people voted for him. His hardly-known competitor, Moussa Moustafa Moussa, received 656,534 votes, making up 2.9 percent of the valid ballots. The turnout stood at 24,254,152 voters, representing 41 percent of 50,078,138 registered voters. In a televised speech after winning the election, Sisi pledged to keep his promise in serving the nation and thanked all Egyptians for trusting him to lead the country. “With complete honesty, I pledge to keep my promise with you and to dedicate myself to spare no efforts for our great nation,” Sisi said on Monday. The national unity that was shown during the election was strong evidence of Egypt’s solid power against those who wanted to undermine the country, he added. Much like the 2014 election, when Sisi competed against well-known politician Hamdeen Sabahy, invalid votes ranked second in the poll. In the 2014 vote, 23.4 million people voted for Sisi, invalid votes accounted for one million ballots, and Sabahy won 740,000 votes. In 2018, invalid votes made up 7.27 percent of the total votes, accounting for 1.762 million ballots. If invalid votes are not excluded from the result, Sisi's share of the total votes would be 90 percent.

News article:
PARIS, April 3 (Reuters) - France on Tuesday wished Abdel Fattah al-Sisi success for his next presidential term in Egypt and said it stood "resolutely" with the country on the fight against terrorism. Sisi, who had no real opposition, was re-elected for a second term with 97 percent of the vote, official returns showed. "France offers its wishes for the full success of President Sisi for his second mandate," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnes Von Der Muhll said in a daily briefing.

With both France and Egypt concerned by the political vacuum in Libya and the threat from jihadist groups in Egypt, the two countries have cultivated even closer economic and military ties under Sisi. Rights organizations have accused France under President Emmanuel Macron of turning a blind eye to what they say are increasing violations of freedoms by Sisi's government. After hosting Sisi in Paris in October, Macron said it was not up to him to "lecture" Egypt on civil liberties. "France stands resolutely alongside Egypt to face the common challenge of terrorism, to work for the solution of regional crises and to develop cooperation at the United Nations, in Africa and in the Mediterranean," von Der Muhll said. She added that Paris would continue its dialogue with Egypt on human rights and fundamental freedoms.

The news article is about France's support for Sisi's re-election and its commitment to working with Egypt to combat terrorism.

News article:
PARIS, April 3 (Reuters) - France on Tuesday wished Abdel Fattah al-Sisi success for his next presidential term in Egypt and said it stood "resolutely" with the country on the fight against terrorism. Sisi, who had no real opposition, was re-elected for a second term with 97 percent of the vote, official returns showed. "France offers its wishes for the full success of President Sisi for his second mandate," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnes Von Der Muhll said in a daily briefing. "It hopes that his reelection will allow him to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the Egyptian people for security, prosperity and the full expression of freedoms in a constitutional framework," she said without elaborating.

The image shows a group of people in Egypt holding a large poster of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. This image is related to the news article because it shows Egyptians expressing their support for Sisi, who was recently re-elected for a second term. The image also shows a woman holding a poster of Sisi, which suggests that women are also mendukung Sisi. This is significant because Sisi has been criticized for his human rights record, including his treatment of women. The image therefore provides a visual representation of the news article, and helps to illustrate the story.

President of the Republic of Portugal Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa-Wikipedia, July, 17, 2017 CAIRO – 11 April 2018: Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa will meet Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Ahmad al-Tayeb on Thursday as part of his visit to Egypt from Wednesday to Friday. On the sidelines of his meeting, the Portuguese president will take a tour of Al-Azhar Mosque, accompanied by al-Tayeb, to see its architectural and historic landmarks, particularly after its restoration. After his tour, he will give a lecture highlighting the relations between East and West, as well as the ways to enhance the values of coexistence and dialogue between different cultures and religions, referring to Portugal as a role model for coexistence among its community components. During his visit to Egypt, the Portuguese president will meet with President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, as well as Egyptian and Portuguese businessmen. Several economic and trade agreements are expected to be signed between Egypt and Portugal during the President de Sousa’s three-day visit, which started on Wednesday, April 11. According to a statement issued Wednesday by Egypt's State Information Service (SIS), President de Sousa is expected to meet with Sisi on Thursday. This is the first visit of a Portuguese president to Egypt in 24 years. De Sousa was elected president of Portugal in 2016. The SIS statement affirmed that this visit will be a great chance for both countries to enhance their economic, political, diplomatic and cultural cooperation. Egypt and Portugal are members of the intergovernmental organization Union for the Mediterranean, which includes 43 countries from Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. Previously, Grand Imam al-Tayeb embarked on a tour on March 14 to visit Portugal and attend the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Islamic Society in Portugal. De Sousa praised the visit of Tayeb, stressing that he delivered a message of peace and tolerance. President Sisi, on the other hand, made an official visit to Portugal in December 2016, where he met President de Sousa, the prime minister and the mayor of Lisbon, along with representatives of a number of scientific and academic institutions and businessmen. The talks tackled the means of promoting political and diplomatic ties and boosting cooperation in the fields of economy, science, research and defense, along with regional and international issues, including the situation in the Middle East and ways to combat terrorism. Egypt has been looking into cooperation in military manufacturing with Portugal, as Egyptian Minister of State for Military Production Mohamed El-Assar discussed cooperation in the field of joint military and civil manufacturing with Portuguese Ambassador to Egypt Madalena Fischer in December 2017.

News article:
Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry is set to fly to Burundi on Tuesday to work towards boosting relations between the two countries, a statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry said on Monday. Egypt's foreign ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid said Shoukry is heading to Burundi's capital of Bujumbura to review joint ties and to discuss issues of bilateral interest. "The visit comes in the framework of Egypt's special interest to boost and support relations with Nile Basin countries and those of the African continent generally," the statement said. The Egyptian foreign minister will meet Burundi's President Pierre Nkurunziza, as well as other officials including his Burundian counterpart, and will inaugurate a number of development projects granted by Egypt to the African country under the framework of the Egyptian Agency of Partnership for Development. Abu Zeid noted that Egypt was the first Arab country to establish diplomatic relations with Burundi following the latter's independence in 1962, and added that Egypt has provided aid and training towards development projects for their Burundian brothers, as well as support for Burundi's security and stability during Egypt's membership in the United Nations Security Council in 2016 and 2017. According to the spokesman, around 150 Burundian trainees participated in training workshops during 2017 in the fields of health, medicine, agriculture, military and police training and combating terrorism. Egypt has also provided medical aid to Burundi in the past, he pointed out. The issue of the Nile's water and other matters related to African relations will be discussed by Shoukry and his counterparts, according to Abu Zeid. Burundi is among other Nile basin countries, including Ethiopia, which have previously said that they want to re-negotiate all treaties related to the Nile, including the 1929 Nile Waters Agreement, which gives Egypt the right to veto Nile development projects that might threaten its water share. Burundi is one of the basin countries expected to pass the Cooperation Framework Agreement on the Nile, which will "promote integrated management, sustainable development, and harmonious utilization of the water resources of the basin, as well as its conservation and protection for the benefit of present and future generations," according to the text of the agreement.

News article:
Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry is set to fly to Burundi on Tuesday to work towards boosting relations between the two countries, a statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry said on Monday. Egypt's foreign ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid said Shoukry is heading to Burundi's capital of Bujumbura to review joint ties and to discuss issues of bilateral interest. "The visit comes in the framework of Egypt's special interest to boost and support relations with Nile Basin countries and those of the African continent generally," the statement said. The Egyptian foreign minister will meet Burundi's President Pierre Nkurunziza, as well as other officials including his Burundian counterpart, and will inaugurate a number of development projects granted by Egypt to the African country under the framework of the Egyptian Agency of Partnership for Development. Abu Zeid noted that Egypt was the first Arab country to establish diplomatic relations with Burundi following the latter's independence in 1962, and added that Egypt has provided aid and training towards development projects for their Burundian brothers, as well as support for Burundi's security and stability during Egypt's membership in the United Nations Security Council in 2016 and 2017. According to the spokesman, around 150 Burundian trainees participated in training workshops during 2017 in the fields of health, medicine, agriculture, military and police training and combating terrorism. Egypt has also provided medical aid to Burundi in the past, he pointed out. The issue of the Nile's water and other matters related to African relations will be discussed by Shoukry and his counterparts, according to Abu Zeid. Burundi is among other Nile basin countries, including Ethiopia, which have previously said that they want to re-negotiate all treaties related to the Nile, including the 1929 Nile Waters Agreement, which gives Egypt the right to veto Nile development projects that might threaten its water share. Burundi is one of the basin countries expected to pass the Cooperation Framework Agreement on the Nile, which will "promote integrated management, sustainable development, and harmonious utilization of the water resources of the basin, as well as its conservation and protection for the benefit of present and future generations," according to the text of the agreement.

“There is much to gain, in terms of access to new sources of energy and market opportunities, for European and Egyptian citizens and businesses alike," says EU Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete The European Union is set to sign a strategic partnership agreement on energy with Egypt, 22-24 April, a press release by the European Commission read. European Climate and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete will arrive to Cairo Sunday and is expected to meet Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi. “Egypt is becoming an upcoming important gas and electricity hub that can provide energy security for the EU and for the entire region,” said Cañete in the statement. On behalf of the Commission, Cañete is expected to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Egyptian government that will last from 2018 to 2022. The memorandum highlights six priorities in the context of the EU-Egypt partnership. These priorities include, according to the statement, “further assistance to the development of the oil and gas sector,” “continued support to electricity sector reforms,” and “development of the energy hub.” The statement also references “Further assistance with joint measures and projects in the field of renewable energy,” “additional support on energy efficiency strategies, policies and measures, across various sectors,” and “cooperation in technological, scientific and industrial areas across the energy field.” During his visit, Cañete is expected to meet with Prime Minister Sherif Ismail, Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy Mohamed Shaker, and Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Tarek El-Molla. Cañete is also expected to meet with European energy companies and launch the EU-Egypt Sustainable Energy Business Forum & Exhibition. The two-day trip will include a site visit to Egypt’s Zohr gas field, discovered in 2015 and estimated to contain 30 trillion cubic feet of gas. The gas filed is located near Egypt’s Suez Canal city of Port Said. “There is much to gain, in terms of access to new sources of energy and market opportunities, for European and Egyptian citizens and businesses alike. The EU stands ready to support Egypt in its energy market reforms and to boost sustainable energy investment,” said Cañete. The last agreement signed between Egypt and the EU was in Brussels in 2008 to enhance EU-Egypt energy cooperation. That agreement covered, among other areas, energy market reform, convergence of Egypt’s energy market with that of the EU, promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency, the development of energy networks, and technological and industrial cooperation. The new memorandum of understand will replace that signed between the EU and Egypt in 2008. Search Keywords: Short link:

News article:
The International Finance Corporation's investments in Egypt reached nearly 1 billion dollars. Washington - Asharq Al-Awsat International Finance Corporation (IFC) announced Sunday that its investments to support Egypt’s private sector have amounted to nearly $1 billion during the current fiscal year. IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, indicated that Egypt's economic reforms affirmed its commitment to boost the Egyptian economy. IFC's Chief Business Officer Stephanie von Friedberg met Egypt's delegation headed by Minister of Investment and International Cooperation Sahar Nasr, to discuss ways to enhance private sector participation in economic development. Friedberg said Egypt implemented strong economic reforms that once again drew the interest of investors. “Reforms in the energy sector, in particular, helped attract a number of first-time investors and financiers to the country. Continuing reforms will help open up more sectors to private investment, which is vital to improve economic growth," she added. Egypt is one of IFC's largest investment portfolios in the Middle East and North Africa region, with investments of $2.9 billion from 2006 until 2017. IFC’s investments aim to support the private sector in the North African country, create jobs and promote economic growth. Investments include financial markets, infrastructure, oil and gas, agribusiness, manufacturing and healthcare. During 2018, IFC led a consortium to finance the construction of 13 solar power plants in Aswan worth $653 million. The corporation also provided a $100 million loan to help one of Egypt's leading banks to scale up the lending operations to customers and provided $150 million in Islamic financing to al-Marai, a dairy company, to help boost the country's food sector.

Cairo- Mohamed Abdu Hassanein Egypt’s government is looking forward to the World Bank's involvement in reconstruction efforts in the Sinai Peninsula, where the army is currently engaged in a fierce war to eliminate terrorist armed groups. The government is currently working on developing the Sinai Peninsula quickly, said International Investment and Investment Minister Sahar Nasr after meeting with World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim in Washington on Monday. In a statement on Monday, Nasr said that investing in humans is a top government priority. She also thanked the bank for supporting the strategy of developing education by 500 million dollars. The government is working on developing Sinai as soon as possible at the directives of President Sisi, Nasr added. Both sides discussed the bank's support to the sector of energy. A number of international financial institutions and Arab funds are working to support and finance Emaar’s Sinai project. The army launched an operation in February to crush terrorists who have waged an insurgency that has killed hundreds of soldiers, police and residents over many years. According to data released by military spokesmen since operations launched, clashes have killed at least 200 terrorists at least. Battles have also caused the death of over 30 soldiers, including officers, and wounded others. During spring WB meetings in Washington, President Kim lauded the success achieved in the Egyptian economy and laws passed for improving the investment environment. Kim said President Abdel Fattah El Sisi had courageously eliminated the challenges facing development in Egypt and set plans that contributed to the success of the Egyptian economy. The bank is working on investing in education, health and social protection to increase growth, Kim said. In December 2017, Sisi announced his intention to realize a $5.6 billion urban project in the Sinai Peninsula over the next two to three years. Sinai residents are suffering from living difficulties caused by the ongoing military operation, but the Egyptian government confirms that it covered the provision of food convoys and the distribution of large amounts of rations for citizens affected by the campaign.

Cairo- Mohamed Abdu Hassanein Egypt’s government is looking forward to the World Bank's involvement in reconstruction efforts in the Sinai Peninsula, where the army is currently engaged in a fierce war to eliminate terrorist armed groups. The government is currently working on developing the Sinai Peninsula quickly, said International Investment and Investment Minister Sahar Nasr after meeting with World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim in Washington on Monday. In a statement on Monday, Nasr said that investing in humans is a top government priority. She also thanked the bank for supporting the strategy of developing education by 500 million dollars. The government is working on developing Sinai as soon as possible at the directives of President Sisi, Nasr added. Both sides discussed the bank's support to the sector of energy. A number of international financial institutions and Arab funds are working to support and finance Emaar’s Sinai project. The army launched an operation in February to crush terrorists who have waged an insurgency that has killed hundreds of soldiers, police and residents over many years. According to data released by military spokesmen since operations launched, clashes have killed at least 200 terrorists at least. Battles have also caused the death of over 30 soldiers, including officers, and wounded others. During spring WB meetings in Washington, President Kim lauded the success achieved in the Egyptian economy and laws passed for improving the investment environment. Kim said President Abdel Fattah El Sisi had courageously eliminated the challenges facing development in Egypt and set plans that contributed to the success of the Egyptian economy. The bank is working on investing in education, health and social protection to increase growth, Kim said. In December 2017, Sisi announced his intention to realize a $5.6 billion urban project in the Sinai Peninsula over the next two to three years. Sinai residents are suffering from living difficulties caused by the ongoing military operation, but the Egyptian government confirms that it covered the provision of food convoys and the distribution of large amounts of rations for citizens affected by the campaign.

Electricity pylons in northern England- REUTERS-Phil Noble CAIRO – 24 April 2018: Deputy Electricity Minister Osama Asran and First Undersecretary of the Ministry Mohammed Mossa Omran headed to Sudan on Monday to agree upon the terms of the electricity interconnection project between the two countries. An official source in the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy said that Asran is expected to sign a memorandum of understanding with the energy officials in Sudan in preparation for signing contracts to start the project. The source pointed out that the capacity of the project will be 200-300 MW, according to the electricity needs of the Sudanese people, explaining that Egypt is able to complete the project within six months. Minister of Electricity Mohamed Shaker said earlier that Egypt is eager to support the African and Nile Basin countries’ needs of electricity in light of the higher capacity of Egypt’s national electricity network than the needs of Egyptians. Shaker added that Egypt is studying electricity interconnection with the African countries to benefit from the hydropower in Africa. The expected investment cost of the project in Egypt is $56 million (LE 990 million), Egyptian Electricity Transmission Co. (EETC) Chairman Gamal Abdel Rehem said, clarifying that Sudan will afford the cost of constructing electricity lines on its land. Abdel Rehem added that an interconnection between Egypt and Sudan will be the starting point for electrical linkage between Egypt and all Africa. Meanwhile, Egypt will sign the contracts of the electricity interconnection project with Saudi Arabia in June to start the implementation of the project. Electrical interconnection lines between Egypt and Saudi Arabia are scheduled to begin operation in the beginning of 2021, with a capacity of 3,000 MW. The Egyptian-Saudi project targets making Egypt a central hub for electricity among the Arab countries, aiming to establish an infrastructure for electricity trade between the Arab countries in preparation for the establishment of a common market for electricity. Egypt is already electrically interconnected with Jordon and Libya. Egypt signed a memorandum of understanding with Cyprus and Greece to interconnect electrically, which will make Egypt a central hub for electricity linkage between three continents. The electricity interconnection between Egypt and Jordon is currently working at capacities ranging between 400 and 450 MW. These capacities are currently being increased.

News article:
CAIRO – 25 April 2018: President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi stressed Wednesday that Egypt has adopted a comprehensive and ambitious strategy to develop the electricity system in full, Presidential spokesperson Bassam Radi announced. Developing Egypt’s electricity system qualifies it to become a hub for the transfer of electricity between the countries of the region and EU countries in the framework of the projects of electric linkage. On Apr. 21, EU Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Cañete announce he will arrive in Egypt on 22 to 24 April on top of a high-level delegation for a new strategic partnership on energy. The visit is a key element of the external dimension of the Energy Union, a political priority of the Juncker Commission, according to the statement. Cañete added that there is much to gain in terms of access to new sources of energy and market opportunities, for European and Egyptian citizens and businesses alike. The Egyptian-EU Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by Minister of Electricity, Mohamed Shaker; Minister of Petroleum, Tarek al-Molla and Cañete. The agreement followed extensive discussions held at ministerial levels, a number of high-level reciprocal visits, and a series of coordination meetings and comprehensive deliberations. EU Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Cañete signing the EU energy MoU with (L) Minister of Petroleum, Tarek al-Molla and (R) Minister of Electricity, Mohamed Shaker – Egypt Today/Sulaiman Al-Otiefi Shaker said that the Egypt-EU energy MoU includes a number of aspects, notably cooperation in the energy sector, raising efficiency of local energy and continuing technical support for the electricity sector reforms. Sisi’s meeting with Cañete included a discussion over issues of the environment, climate change, the volume of development in the electricity sector, and the mechanisms of intensifying cooperation between Egypt and the European Union. According to Radi, the Egyptian leader said Egypt took the initiative to cooperate with neighboring countries in the field of gas and energy, especially with the establishment of liquefaction plants, ports and gas pipeline networks. (L to R) Minister of Petroleum, Tarek al-Molla, Prime Minister Sherif Ismail, EU Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Cañete, and Minister of Electricity, Mohamed Shaker – Egypt Today/Sulaiman Al-Otiefi The president also expressed Egypt’s appreciation for cooperation with the EU, which would add to the strategic relationship with the EU. “I hope this visit will result a new phase of closer and deeper relations; Egypt can lead the way of clean energy transition in the Middle East region, and thus contribute to the Paris climate goals and the worldwide de-carbonization effort,” Cañete said. Moreover, Cañete added that the EU stands ready to support Egypt in its energy market reforms and to boost sustainable energy investment. Egypt's unprecedented achievements and its strategic location qualify it to be a major player in energy supply to the Euro-Mediterranean region and in this regard, the EU values Egypt's effective participation in the energy sector, a UN statement said Monday.

News article:
Egypt's foreign minister Sameh Shoukry is set to fly to South Sudan on Thursday to attend an opening session for a meeting by the South Sudan Liberation Movement's (SPLM) National Liberation Council, according to Egyptian foreign ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid. Shoukry will be attending the meeting on behalf of President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi upon an invitation by the SPLM extended to “a limited number of African leaders who are guarantors of the Arusha accord for the movement's reunification.” The 12-page Arusha Accord, which was signed in Tanzania in January 2015 between representatives from three conflicting factions of the SPLM party, outlines key steps towards a reunification of the party. Abu Zeid said that the council’s invitation reflects the special relationship between Egypt and South Sudan, adding that the meeting, which will be held in Juba on 3-5 May, aims to support efforts to reunify the movement. The National Liberation Council is the second highest level in the SPLM after its political bureau, and consists of 170 members as representatives of different states in South Sudan, according to Abu Zeid. "The Egyptian participation comes in the framework of continued efforts to achieve peace and stability in South Sudan, as Egypt has voiced support for South Sudanese President Silva Kiir's initiative to establish a committee to facilitate the national dialogue," he added. Egypt has hosted talks on the course of implementing Arusha, sponsoring the discussions in correlation with Uganda. Last November, Egypt sponsored the signing of a declaration of unification between two factions of the SPLM at the headquarters of Egypt's intelligence agency in Cairo. The declaration, which supports peace efforts to end the dispute between the rival factions and stipulates the return of refugees displaced by conflict, was signed under the auspices of President El-Sisi and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. The Egyptian foreign ministry spokesman highlighted efforts by Egypt since 2005 to execute an integrated strategy to support development efforts since the inking of the Naivasha comprehensive peace agreement. Signed in 2005 by the SPLM and Sudan's government, Naivasha aimed to end the second Sudanese civil war through an immediate ceasefire between the SPLM and the government of Sudan. Egypt has provided aid to South Sudan, building four power stations and a number of schools and medical clinics, and has also provided aid in irrigation. This is the second visit to South Sudan by the Egyptian foreign minister in less than a month, as Shoukry recently visited Juba to sign a memo to establish a mechanism for political consultation. Shoukry's visit comes a few days after President El-Sisi received a phone call from his South Sudanese counterpart Kiir, where El-Sisi accentuated Egypt's support to South Sudan.

News article:
Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry on Thursday stressed Egypt's support for a resolution to the political crisis in South Sudan while attending the opening session of the South Sudan Liberation Movement's (SPLM) National Liberation Council in Juba, according to Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid. The opening session, which convenes from 3-5 May, was attended by President of Uganda Yoweri Musevenias well as South Sudanese President Salva Kiir. Abu Zeid explained that the meetings in Juba are aimed at finding an agreed solution to the current crisis in South Sudan. He added that Egypt's vision is based on the country's need to resolve the crises through negotiations while preserving South Sudan's sovereignty and regional integration. In a speech, Shoukry, who is attending on behalf of the Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, highlighted the commitment of the guarantor states to the Arusha Agreement to achieve peace, stability and prosperity for the people of Southern Sudan. "Egypt will continue its efforts to support the brothers in South Sudan in order to achieve peace," said the Egyptian minister. He expressed his hopes that the council's discussions will contribute to reaching an agreement that includes all the parties in South Sudan, as well as the success of the National Dialogue Committee in its efforts to achieve internal consensus. The 12-page Arusha agreement was signed in Tanzania in January 2015 by representatives from three conflicting factions of the SPLM party, outlining key steps towards a reunification of the party. The National Liberation Council is the second-highest level in the SPLM after its political bureau, and consists of 170 members as representatives of different states in South Sudan, according to Abu Zeid. Meanwhile, Shoukry pointed out that South Sudan can not afford to miss another opportunity to achieve peace and stability after years of its people's suffering, and praised President Kiir's ongoing efforts to achieve security and peace in the country. Shoukry also stressed Egypt's continuing role to support the political and economic stability of South Sudan. "Egypt has faith in justice and peace which will be meeting the rights of all parties and which could only be achieved through the implementation of the rule of law," Abu Zeid's statement read.

Egypt's state banks said they will start releasing this month the funds of clients who invested in high-yield certificates of deposit (CDs) offered when the central bank floated the currency in late 2016. Egypt’s three state banks, Banque Misr, the National Bank of Egypt and Banque du Caire began offering 18-month CDs at 20 percent and three-year CDs at 16 percent in November 2016. The National Bank of Egypt will start to gradually return funds for 18-month CDs issued in November and December 2016, which are valued at EGP 188 billion, the bank’s deputy chairman Yehia Aboul Fotouh said on Saturday. The bank has raised a total of EGP 467 billion from the certificates, EGP 400 billion of which are from the 18-month CDs, Aboul Fotouh told satellite TV channel CBC. He said that more than a quarter of the money was raised from some 1.5 million new clients who joined the banking system for the first time. The bank is currently offering its clients three-year variable rate certificates of deposit at 17 percent, three-year fixed rate certificates at 15 percent and one-year certificates at 16.25. Banque Misr will return EGP 46 billion from the 18-month CDs issued in November 2016 to clients this month, the bank’s deputy head Atef Maghraby told Egyptian news website Al-Masry Al-Youm on Sunday. Maghraby said that alternatives offered by his bank include three-year fixed and variable rate certificates. The CDs are part of efforts to stabilise the Egyptian pound and attract clients who are keeping cash outside the banking system. Search Keywords: Short link:

Granite sphinx of Taharqo, 25th Dynasty from a temple at Kawa. Now residing in the British Museum, London via Wikimedia commons/ Jon Bodsworth CAIRO – 7 May 2018: Sudanese author Abdel Aal Hemat called on the Egyptian government to start teaching the Nubian language as part of its educational curriculum in schools, saying that this language is considered part of the historical heritage of the culture of Sudan and Egypt.“There is only one university in central Sudan that teaches the Nubian language; no other universities or schools teach it in all of Africa, which will affect the existence and significance of Nubian culture and history on the long term,” Hemat said in statements to media outlets on Monday.By 2020, some of the schools in North Sudan will start teaching this language as part of its educational curriculum, according to Hemat; however, he also wishes that Egypt takes a similar decision to protect the language, which has shaped a huge part of Egyptian and Sudanese history.He added that the Nubian language consists of 24 characters; each one needs at least four hours of good practice and learning to be perfectly understood and fluently spoken. “This language has a 5,000-year-old history. It’s one of the oldest languages ever spoken,” Hemat affirmed.Nubia currently is a region located between Aswan in southern Egypt and Khartoum in central Sudan. In the past, several old civilizations lived and thrived in this area, including the Kerma and Kush kingdoms, which were described by UNESCO as “great powers” that ruled Nubia.“Taharqa” was a Kush-Nubian pharaoh who ruled ancient Egypt as part of the 25th Dynasty and established several pillars inside the Karnak Temple complex, but only one pillar from his civilization has survived until now.Nubian people are trying to preserve their culture as much as possible by passing the language on to their children to prevent it from being lost; however, some Nubian people complain that there are no real measures being taken to preserve and guarantee the existence of this language.The Nubian language played a significant role during the 1973 October War as a secret code for the Egyptian army.

DP World, the world’s fourth-biggest ports operator, signed a preliminary agreement with Egypt’s Suez Canal Authority and the Egyptian government to jointly develop a new inland container depot near Cairo as part of efforts to spur the North African country’s economic growth. “Developing trade infrastructure to improve hinterland access for goods bound for Africa’s growing economic needs is essential,” said DP World group chairman and chief executive, Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem. The Egyptian government is working to promote sustainable economic development for the country through a structural reform programme, funded in part through a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), awarded in 2016 when Egypt was grappling with a period of slow growth. The US-based lender projects stronger GDP growth for Egypt over the next two years in the context of the IMF-funded reforms, at 5.2 per cent in 2018 and 5.5 per cent in 2019. Under this week’s agreement, DP World, Egypt’s Holding Company for Maritime and Land Transport, and the Suez Canal Authority aim to develop the new container depot in Egypt’s 6th of October City, a satellite town in the Giza Governorate, part of the urban area of Cairo. ________________ Read more: [ IMF encourages Egypt to deepen economic reforms, pursue job creation ] [ Egypt seeks foreign investors for Red Sea projects as it targets pre-2011 tourism levels in 3 years ] [ Exclusive: DP World to maintain about $1bn capex for next three years ] ________________ The three partners, led by DP World, will bid for the government contract for the project later this year, the ports operator said on Monday. The proposed depot is intended to “increase the flow of cargo between ships and major land transportation networks in the country, creating a central distribution point”. The project – the result of a previous cooperation agreement between the three companies – will serve trade in Egypt by linking inland and marine ports, said Mohamed Ahmad Ibrahim Youssef, chairman of the Company of Maritime and Land Transport. “This partnership is aligned with Egypt’s strategy for sustainable development and the [government ministries’] policy to increase activities and investments of its companies in projects that raise developmental levels, create jobs for Egyptian youth and increase the profits of Egyptian companies to fuel local GDP,” the chairman said. UAE-based DP World already has a presence in Egypt – it has been operating the Sokhna Port for the past decade. Last year it signed a partnership agreement with the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone) to form a joint venture company to develop a special economic free zone in Ain Sokhna. Under the agreement, SCZone is to hold 51 per cent of shares in the new vehicle and DP World the remaining 49 per cent.

CAIRO – 9 May 2018: The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) expects growth in Egypt to record 5.3 percent in 2018 and 5.5 percent in 2019, up from 4.3 percent in 2016 and 4.2 percent in 2017, with an increase of 0.8 percent.This came at the Bank’s new Regional Economic Prospects report that includes the predictions of the economic trends in 37 economies across three continents, from Estonia to Egypt and from Morocco to Mongolia.The report expected a growth rate of 3.3 percent in 2018 in all 37 countries to record 3.2 percent in 2019.“The economic momentum remained strong but that growth might now have peaked,” the report clarified.The EBRD’s Chief Economist, Sergei Guriev, said that the lower productivity growth reflected the fact that most EBRD economies had exhausted the growth levers that had delivered rapid expansion until the onset of the crisis.“In order to develop new sources of growth, these countries need to carry out structural reforms of product, capital and labour markets. They need to improve governance, promote integration into the global economy, and invest in human capital and sustainable infrastructure,” Guriev said.“The good news is that the current recovery provides a solid window of opportunity for such reforms,” he added.The bank depended on several risks to determine its forecasts, including: corporate debt levels, stock market levels, persistent security threats and geopolitical tensions as well as a high degree of concentration of sources of global growth.Planning Minister Hala el-Saeed said that Egypt’s growth rate pushed the government and international organizations to raise their expectations of the economic growth to 5.3 percent currently, up from 4.6 percent in 2017/2018 before implementing the reform program.Egypt had embarked on a bold economic reform program that included the introduction of taxes, such as the value-added tax (VAT), and cutting energy subsidies, all with the aim of trimming the budget deficit.The state floated its currency in November 2016; losing 50 percent of its value, as part of the economic reform program.She added that Egypt is targeting a growth rate of 5.8 percent, to be accelerated gradually to 8 percent by 2021/2022.HC Securities & Investment (HC) expects Egypt’s gross domestic product (GDP) to reach 5.3 percent in 2017/2018 and 6 percent in 2018/2019, reaching 6.2 percent in 2019/2020.The International Monetary Fund expected earlier that Egypt will record a GDP of 5.2 percent in the current fiscal year and to reach 5.5 percent next year, with an increase of 0.7 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively.The IMF further anticipated the GDP to record 6 percent in 2023.The IMF’s executive board approved in November 2016 a three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFT) loan to Egypt worth $12 billion to support its economic reform program.

During the launching ceremony of the Egyptian Mexican Business Council in Cairo - Egypt Today CAIRO – 9 May 2018: The Mexico-Egypt Business Council was launched on Tuesday to activate cooperation between Egypt and Mexico. The council aims at deepening communication and partnership among companies in both countries, as well as discovering new cooperation opportunities, as it consists of companies that are already operating in both countries and others that are interested in starting their business in each. The participating companies in the business council are CEMEX, Pico Energie, Aqualia, Swede Electrometer, Kidzania, Rohrbomben and Polyimeros Michecanos, which will start its business in Egypt this year with a plastic products factory in Alexandria. The inauguration took place in the presence of Ahmed Anter, head of the Egyptian Commercial Service; Paulo Carreño, head of ProMexico; Ahmed el-Wakeel, president of the General Federation of Egyptian Chambers of Commerce; Jose Octavio Tripp, Mexico’s ambassador to Egypt; Reda Habib Ibrahim, deputy foreign affairs minister for the Americas; and Carlos Emilio Gonzalez, president of CEMEX Egypt. “The establishment of the Mexico-Egypt Business Council will represent a perfect platform of business community for both countries to discuss and explore new venues of trade and investment opportunities and to contribute in enhancing Egyptian-Mexican relations on all levels,” Ahmed Antar said. “The Mexico-Egypt relationship has developed to become one of the most solid ones in the region. Despite our most visible differences, Mexico and Egypt find common ground at diverse spheres,” CEO PROMÉXICO Paulo Carreno said. Carreno clarified that these diverse spheres range from culture and history, to economy and trade. For example, both countries are expected to be amongst the top 15 economies by 2050. For his part, Deputy Minister Reda Habib Ibrahim retained the commitment of the Egyptian government to work hand in hand for Egyptian and Mexican companies, mentioning that the newly established council is to facilitate trade and investments. Ahmed el-Wakeel said that Egypt is a land of opportunities in the fields of trade, logistics, agriculture, tourism and mega projects. “With a population over 100 million and an increasing per-capita income, Egypt has the largest domestic market in the region. Mexican companies will benefit from these characteristics, besides Egypt’s free-trade agreements, to increase their exports and trade to Egypt,” Wakeel added. Egypt is involved in international trade deals that came into action during the recent period. The Mercosur Agreement, which is a free-trade agreement signed by Egypt and Mercosur countries in 2010, includes immediate customs clearance for 63 percent of the exports of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay to Egypt. The Mercosur trade deal covers food, cars, auto parts and industrial supplies; it was signed by Egypt and Mercosur members in 2010, but only came into force in 2017. Another trade agreement that Egypt is involved in is the deal with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), which represents a free trade area with 19 member states stretching from Libya to Swaziland. COMESA was formed in December 1994, replacing a Preferential Trade Area, which had existed since 1981. The African Continental Free Trade Area is another agreement to ease the trade exchange between countries that have signed it, according to a scheduled timeline and not through an immediate activation of the agreement. The African Continental Free Trade Area is considered to be the biggest deal ever signed since the World Trade Organization was established; it was signed by 43 countries. In September 2017, Minister of Investment and International Cooperation Sahar Nasr discussed the establishment of the Mexico-Egypt Business Council with Mexican Ambassador to Egypt Jose Okatvio Trip to increase Mexico’s investments in Egypt.

News article:
During the launching ceremony of the Egyptian Mexican Business Council in Cairo - Egypt Today CAIRO – 9 May 2018: The Mexico-Egypt Business Council was launched on Tuesday to activate cooperation between Egypt and Mexico. The council aims at deepening communication and partnership among companies in both countries, as well as discovering new cooperation opportunities, as it consists of companies that are already operating in both countries and others that are interested in starting their business in each. The participating companies in the business council are CEMEX, Pico Energie, Aqualia, Swede Electrometer, Kidzania, Rohrbomben and Polyimeros Michecanos, which will start its business in Egypt this year with a plastic products factory in Alexandria. The inauguration took place in the presence of Ahmed Anter, head of the Egyptian Commercial Service; Paulo Carreño, head of ProMexico; Ahmed el-Wakeel, president of the General Federation of Egyptian Chambers of Commerce; Jose Octavio Tripp, Mexico’s ambassador to Egypt; Reda Habib Ibrahim, deputy foreign affairs minister for the Americas; and Carlos Emilio Gonzalez, president of CEMEX Egypt. “The establishment of the Mexico-Egypt Business Council will represent a perfect platform of business community for both countries to discuss and explore new venues of trade and investment opportunities and to contribute in enhancing Egyptian-Mexican relations on all levels,” Ahmed Antar said. “The Mexico-Egypt relationship has developed to become one of the most solid ones in the region. Despite our most visible differences, Mexico and Egypt find common ground at diverse spheres,” CEO PROMÉXICO Paulo Carreno said. Carreno clarified that these diverse spheres range from culture and history, to economy and trade. For example, both countries are expected to be amongst the top 15 economies by 2050. For his part, Deputy Minister Reda Habib Ibrahim retained the commitment of the Egyptian government to work hand in hand for Egyptian and Mexican companies, mentioning that the newly established council is to facilitate trade and investments. Ahmed el-Wakeel said that Egypt is a land of opportunities in the fields of trade, logistics, agriculture, tourism and mega projects. “With a population over 100 million and an increasing per-capita income, Egypt has the largest domestic market in the region. Mexican companies will benefit from these characteristics, besides Egypt’s free-trade agreements, to increase their exports and trade to Egypt,” Wakeel added. Egypt is involved in international trade deals that came into action during the recent period. The Mercosur Agreement, which is a free-trade agreement signed by Egypt and Mercosur countries in 2010, includes immediate customs clearance for 63 percent of the exports of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay to Egypt. The Mercosur trade deal covers food, cars, auto parts and industrial supplies; it was signed by Egypt and Mercosur members in 2010, but only came into force in 2017. Another trade agreement that Egypt is involved in is the deal with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), which represents a free trade area with 19 member states stretching from Libya to Swaziland. COMESA was formed in December 1994, replacing a Preferential Trade Area, which had existed since 1981. The African Continental Free Trade Area is another agreement to ease the trade exchange between countries that have signed it, according to a scheduled timeline and not through an immediate activation of the agreement. The African Continental Free Trade Area is considered to be the biggest deal ever signed since the World Trade Organization was established; it was signed by 43 countries. In September 2017, Minister of Investment and International Cooperation Sahar Nasr discussed the establishment of the Mexico-Egypt Business Council with Mexican Ambassador to Egypt Jose Okatvio Trip to increase Mexico’s investments in Egypt.

Museveni’s two-day visit came on an invitation by Sisi and it aimed to discuss ways to promote bilateral relations, in line with Egypt’s keenness to coordinate and cooperate with its brotherly African countries in different fields. Trade Exchange between Egypt and Uganda increased 27 percent year-on-year to reach $66 million, Head of the Export Development Authority (EDA) Sherine el-Shorbagy said last week. During a press conference on Monday, Minister of Foreign Affairs Sameh Shoukry said that the Egyptian private sector is willing to increase its investments in Uganda.

President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi during the celebration of Egyptian family at Cairo International Stadium Monday March 19, 2017 - Photo courtesy of YouTube CAIRO – 13 May 2018: The relations between Egypt and Sudan can be described as “Holy”, Sudanese Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Information Ahmed Bilal Othman said in a press statement on Sunday. Othman said that the relation between the two countries is at its best as the communication channel is open between Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi and his Sudanese counterpart, Omar Hassan al-Bashir. Othman asserted the importance of the Egyptian-Sudanese cooperation to confront terrorism, assuring that exchange of security information is one of the main areas of cooperation between the two countries. "Egypt has been fighting terrorism for a long time and it has gone a long way in combating terrorism," he added. The two Nile River neighbors, Egypt and Sudan, have common bonds of history, language and religion. But, diplomatic relations have been frosty over the past years due to various reasons. In March, Sisi received Sudanese President Bashir where they both discussed the most important issues of mutual interest, as based on the agreement reached at the recent Addis Ababa tripartite summit. “I firmly stress on the long-standing and close relationship between our brotherly countries, promoted by the historical ties and common aspirations,” said the Sudanese president. The one-day visit of the Sudanese president also focused on tackling cooperation across various fields, as well as issues of joint interest. Egyptian relations with Sudan were recently strained over the border area of Halaib and Shalatin. On December 23, 2017, Sudan filed a complaint to the United Nations Secretariat to protest a maritime border demarcation deal between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, as the deal denotes the territory as Egyptian on maps. Halaib and Shalateen, or the Halaib Triangle, is an area of land measuring 20,580 square kilometers, located at the Egyptian-Sudanese border on the Red Sea coast. It is part of the Red Sea governorate and consists of three major towns – Halaib (which became a city in February 2014), Abu Ramad and Shalateen. The area belongs to Egypt politically and administratively, but has been one of the major sticking points in Egyptian-Sudanese relations since the demarcation of borders between the two countries were carried out during the British occupation of Egypt in 1899, at a time when Sudan was part of the Egyptian Kingdom. The issue re-emerged after Halaib and Shalateen declared electoral constituency in both Sudan and Egypt in 2014. Egypt affirmed that it has never concluded any international treaties or agreements, whether with the U.K. or Sudan, to give international status to the demarcation of administrative borders. The largest tribes that inhabit Hala'ib Triangle, including Rashaida, Alababdeh and Bashaira, rejected the Sudanese National Election Commission's decision that granted the people in Hala'ib the right to participate in Sudanese general elections. The three tribes asserted during the 6 October War victory celebration in 2009 that the area is 100 percent Egyptian.

Jerusalem – Guatemala will move its embassy to Jerusalem on May 16, two days after the United States moves its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The announcement of the date for the planned move came on Wednesday morning, in a post on Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat’s Facebook page. Barkat posted a photo of himself, meeting with Guatemala’s ambassador to Israel, Sarah Solis Castaneda, and CEO of the Guatemalan Foreign Ministry Maria Lucia Ramirez. He said that he met with the women to “discuss operations for the transfer of the embassy on 16 May to Jerusalem as per Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales.” Barkat concluded in his post: “I congratulate the president of Guatemala and the government of Guatemala for the brave decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem. I promised them as much as possible to allow a quick transfer of the embassy to Israel’s capital. I call for more countries to follow the U.S. and Guatemala and to move their embassy to Jerusalem!” Morales announced in May during the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington, D.C., that Guatemala would move its embassy to Jerusalem for the second time. Guatemala was among the first nations to recognize Israel after it declared independence in 1948, and was the first country to establish an embassy in Jerusalem in 1959, before subsequently moving it.

News article:
Asunción – Paraguayan president Horacio Cartes pledged to relocate his country’s embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem at a special celebratory event in Asunción to mark Israel’s 70th anniversary. Cartes said that he would like the move to take place before he leaves office in mid-August. Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon tweeted about the statement under the heading “good news.” But he later said that it was still unclear if plans to relocate the embassy were in the works. Already in March Paraguay indicated that it would relocate its embassy if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to visit. Last September Netanyahu became the first sitting prime minister to visit Latin America, but he had not stopped in Paraguay. In December U.S. President Donald Trump made a dramatic shift in US policy toward Jerusalem when he stated that it was the capital of Israel and that he would move the country’s embassy there. The relocated embassy is expected to open in May. On Friday, Trump said that he may come to Israel for that event. “I may go. I am very proud of it. Jerusalem has been a subject that has been promised for many, many years by presidents. They all made campaign promises but they never had the courage to carry it out. I carried it out.” Guatemala is the only other country who definitely plans to follow through by opening its embassy in the capital in May just a day or two after the US. A few other countries have spoken of doing so, but final approvals for such a move have not been given. This includes Czech Republic, Romania, Honduras and Paraguay. The Czech Republic does intend to open an honorary consulate in Jerusalem but not an official embassy. The international community has largely opposed any declaration of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, including west Jerusalem which is located within the pre-1967 lines. Still initially some 24 countries had embassies in west Jerusalem. But they relocated them after the Knesset’s passage in 1980 of the Jerusalem Law, which formally annexed east Jerusalem. The European Union has been particularly opposed to relocation of any embassies to Jerusalem, holding that this is something that should happen only after a final status agreement is reached for a two-state resolution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Both the Czech Republic and Romania are European Union states. They would be breaking with EU foreign policy should they relocate their embassies. The Czech Foreign Ministry explained last week, that it did not believe such a step was contrary to EU policy. “This step in no way prejudges the final agreement concerning Jerusalem, the same way as it is not being prejudged by diplomatic representations of several European countries that are seated in East Jerusalem,” it said. “The Czech Republic fully respects common policy of the European Union, which considers Jerusalem as the future capital of both the State of Israel and the future State of Palestine.” According to WAFA, the Palestinian news agency, EU foreign policy chief Fedrica Mogherini has said that none of the EU member states will relocate their embassies.

News article:
Asunción – Paraguayan president Horacio Cartes pledged to relocate his country’s embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem at a special celebratory event in Asunción to mark Israel’s 70th anniversary. Cartes said that he would like the move to take place before he leaves office in mid-August. Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon tweeted about the statement under the heading “good news.” But he later said that it was still unclear if plans to relocate the embassy were in the works. Already in March Paraguay indicated that it would relocate its embassy if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to visit. Last September Netanyahu became the first sitting prime minister to visit Latin America, but he had not stopped in Paraguay. In December U.S. President Donald Trump made a dramatic shift in US policy toward Jerusalem when he stated that it was the capital of Israel and that he would move the country’s embassy there. The relocated embassy is expected to open in May. On Friday, Trump said that he may come to Israel for that event. “I may go. I am very proud of it. Jerusalem has been a subject that has been promised for many, many years by presidents. They all made campaign promises but they never had the courage to carry it out. I carried it out.” Guatemala is the only other country who definitely plans to follow through by opening its embassy in the capital in May just a day or two after the US. A few other countries have spoken of doing so, but final approvals for such a move have not been given. This includes Czech Republic, Romania, Honduras and Paraguay. The Czech Republic does intend to open an honorary consulate in Jerusalem but not an official embassy. The international community has largely opposed any declaration of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, including west Jerusalem which is located within the pre-1967 lines. Still initially some 24 countries had embassies in west Jerusalem. But they relocated them after the Knesset’s passage in 1980 of the Jerusalem Law, which formally annexed east Jerusalem. The European Union has been particularly opposed to relocation of any embassies to Jerusalem, holding that this is something that should happen only after a final status agreement is reached for a two-state resolution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Both the Czech Republic and Romania are European Union states. They would be breaking with EU foreign policy should they relocate their embassies. The Czech Foreign Ministry explained last week, that it did not believe such a step was contrary to EU policy. “This step in no way prejudges the final agreement concerning Jerusalem, the same way as it is not being prejudged by diplomatic representations of several European countries that are seated in East Jerusalem,” it said. “The Czech Republic fully respects common policy of the European Union, which considers Jerusalem as the future capital of both the State of Israel and the future State of Palestine.” According to WAFA, the Palestinian news agency, EU foreign policy chief Fedrica Mogherini has said that none of the EU member states will relocate their embassies.

News article:
Guatemala's embassy in Israel moved on Monday to its new location in Jerusalem at the Malkha Technology Park. The official ceremony celebrating the move will take place on May 16, after the U.S. relocates its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, with the likely attendance of Guatemalean president Jimmy Morales. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu celebrated the move and welcomed Guatemala to Jerusalem. "I was moved to see the flag of Guatemala waving in Jerusalem in advance of the opening of the Guatemalan embassy later this month. Dear friends, welcome back to our eternal capital," Netanyahu said. Political sources in Romania, the Czech Republic, Paraguay and Honduras were quoted in recent months as saying that their countries are also considering moving their embassies to Jerusalem, but such a move has yet to take place. Jimmy Morales, president of Guatemala, first announced the move in a speech at the AIPAC policy conference in Washington this March, saying they would move their embassy two days after the U.S. moved theirs. "I'm sure many more countries will follow suit shortly," Morales said. Netanyahu met with Morales during AIPAC, where he thanked the Guatemalan president for recognizing Jerusalem as capital of Israel. Guatemala was one of seven states that voted with the U.S. in a UN vote to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, along with Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, and Togo.

Guatemala on Wednesday started to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, transferring furniture and other equipment into a yet-unfinished office in the capital’s Malha Technology Park.

They will arrive in Israel a day earlier in order to attend a festive event at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem to celebrate the inaugurations of the new Guatemalan and US embassies.

Jerusalem – Paraguay will move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem by the end of May, a Paraguay government spokesman and the Israeli foreign ministry said on Monday, following the United States and Guatemala. “Paraguay President Horacio Cartes plans to come to Israel by the end of the month to open an embassy in Jerusalem,” Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said in a statement. A Paraguay government spokesman said Cartes was scheduling a trip to Israel to move the embassy on May 21 or May 22. The announcement comes one week before the United States embassy opens in Jerusalem on May 14 in accordance with President Donald Trump’s Dec. 6 recognition of the city as Israel’s capital. The U.S. move has delighted Israel and infuriated Palestinians. Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordanian control in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. The last round of peace talks on a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip collapsed in 2014. Israel says Jerusalem is its eternal and indivisible capital, while the Palestinians want the eastern part of the city as the capital of their own future independent state. In March Guatemala’s president, Jimmy Morales, said that his country would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on May 16, two days after the U.S. move. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in April that “at least half a dozen” countries were now “seriously discussing” following the U.S. lead, but he did not identify them. In December, 128 countries voted in a non-binding U.N. General Assembly resolution calling on the United States to drop its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Nine voted against, 35 abstained and 21 did not cast a vote. Paraguay’s embassy is currently located near Tel Aviv

Thus, having decided to move its embassy to Jerusalem, the country breaches the law. We cannot understand how a president or a country can take such a step,” – he stressed.

Paraguay's President Cartes with Prime Minister Netanyahu (Photo: Koby Gideon/GPO) Last month, Cartes announced his intentions to move the Paraguay embassy from Herzliya to Jerusalem before the end of his government's term on August 15. The Paraguayan president surprised attendees with the announcement at an event celebrating Israel's 70th Independence Day in Asunción. Among the invitees were Israel's Ambassador to Paraguay Ze'ev Harel, Cartes' successor Mario Abdo Benitez, the vice president-elect Hugo Velazquez, the country's foreign minister and other dignitaries. In a visit to Venezuela to meet his counterpart there Nicolas Maduro, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he hoped other nations would not follow Paraguay, Guatemala and the United States. "We hope that other countries on the American continent are not going to move their embassies to Jerusalem as this acts against international law," said Abbas. The announcement on Cartes' visit comes one week before the United States embassy opens in Jerusalem on May 14 in accordance with President Donald Trump's December 6 recognition of the city as Israel's capital The US move has delighted Israel and infuriated Palestinians. Israel views Jerusalem as its eternal and indivisible capital, while the Palestinians want the eastern part of the city as the capital of their own future independent state. In March Guatemala 's president, Jimmy Morales, said that his country would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on May 16, two days after the US move. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in April that "at least half a dozen" countries were now "seriously discussing" following the US lead, but he did not identify them. In December, 128 countries voted in a non-binding UN General Assembly resolution calling on the United States to drop its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Nine voted against, 35 abstained and 21 did not cast a vote.

Asuncion – Paraguay’s Foreign Ministry confirmed on Wednesday that the country will shift its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, following the U.S. and Guatemala in a change long sought by Israel’s government but opposed by Palestinians. The ministry said in a statement that it “has begun the process” of carrying out the order by President Horacio Cartes. Israel’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said earlier this week that Cartes would attend the opening ceremony, which he said would occur by the end of May. However, the spokeswoman for Paraguay’s Foreign Ministry, Elvio Venega, said no date has been determined. The Paraguayan statements did not indicate if Cartes would go to Israel for the ceremony. The president, whose five-year term ends Aug. 15, is expected to resign within a few weeks so that he can be sworn into a seat to which he was elected in Paraguay’s Senate. The constitution forbids officials to hold two posts simultaneously. The U.S officially opens its embassy in Jerusalem on May 14 followed two days later by Guatemala. President Donald Trump overturned decades of U.S. policy last year by announcing the Jerusalem move. Israel claims the entire city as its eternal capital. Palestinians want east Jerusalem as their future capital and were infuriated by the declaration. Most countries maintain embassies in Tel Aviv and have balked at moving them until the international legal status of the city has been resolved. Cartes’ decision irked some within Paraguay as well. Luis Castiglioni, who has been designated as the future foreign minister by President-elect Mario Abdo Benitez, told the Mil radio station that “it would have been better to consult with the president-elect in this case, which could have geopolitical consequences.”

News article:
(JTA) — US President Donald Trump’s decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital drew wide international criticism, with 128 countries including the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada voting in favor of a United Nations resolution condemning it. But several countries saw Trump’s decision in a different light: as an example to follow. Shortly after the United States officially moves its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on Monday, it will be joined by Guatemala and Paraguay. Both countries are planning to make the move this month, and Honduras may be next: Its Congress recently passed a resolution urging its foreign ministry to move its embassy. Along with the Czech Republic, whose president said last month it will begin the process of moving its embassy to Jerusalem, these countries belong to a small club (albeit one with a superpower). On a visit to Venezuela on Monday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas urged other Latin American countries not to move their embassies. So how come? Why do these Latin American countries go where others fear to tread? Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Observers suggest a number of reasons, or a combination thereof: The countries are likely motivated by a desire to curry favor with the Trump administration, their leaders’ personal views of the Jewish state and strong historic ties to Israel. In the cases of Guatemala and Honduras, both countries are facing or recently faced political crises — Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales is mired in a corruption scandal and Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez’s recent re-election was dogged by allegations of voter fraud. Their leaders are looking to the US for support, said Arie Kacowicz, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem specializing in Latin America. “They pretty much need and want support and legitimacy from the US and one way of achieving that is by being on friendly, cordial or even extraordinary terms with Israel,” he told JTA. “So if the U.S. is showing the way on this particular issue of Jerusalem, the natural candidates to follow would be those two Central American countries.” Advertisement Though the countries are looking to strengthen ties with Israel, that is not their primary focus, Kacowicz said. “For Guatemala and Honduras, the US is primordial. It’s much more important than Israel,” he said. The two countries also have large immigrant populations in the US that are facing threats of deportation. Those immigrants contribute to their home countries’ economies — for example, one-tenth of Guatemala’s gross domestic product comes from remittances sent back by Guatemalans living abroad. It makes sense to want to be on the Trump administration’s good side. Moving their embassies or expressing support for doing so “is a show of good will” to Trump and the US, agreed Mariano de Alba, associate director of the Adrianne Arsht Latin America Center at the Atlantic Council, a think tank focusing on international affairs. The embassies of Guatemala, Paraguay and Honduras in Washington, DC, did not respond to requests for comment by JTA in time for publication. Trump has signaled that it cares about how other countries respond to its policies regarding Jerusalem. In December, the president said the US was watching the votes of its allies on the UN condemning his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. One hundred and twenty eight countries voted to pass the resolution with only nine — including Guatemala and Honduras — voting against it and 35 countries abstaining — including Paraguay. The resolution asserted the traditional position that “Jerusalem is a final status issue to be resolved through negotiations in line with relevant United Nations resolutions.” Advertisement Following the vote, UN ambassador Nikki Haley even threw a party for the 65 countries that did not support the resolution. The event was labeled as a means to thank the countries for “their friendship to the United States,” according to a copy of the invite obtained by CNN. But it’s not all about Trump. The three countries have ties to Israel that date back to its founding. Latin American countries were largely sympathetic to Israel in its early days, said Dina Siegel Vann, director of the American Jewish Committee’s Arthur and Rochelle Belfer Institute for Latino and Latin American Affairs. “Most Latin American countries are relatively young, and they were very much captivated by Israel’s story, a young country beating the odds after destruction in the Holocaust, and trying to make it in a very hostile environment,” Vann said. Guatemala and its UN ambassador Jorge Garcia Granados played a crucial role in the adoption of the UN partition plan for Palestine in 1947, which recommended creating a Jewish and an Arab state in pre-state Israel. In 1948, Guatemala became the first in Latin America to recognize Israel, setting off a domino effect in the region. Following Israel’s establishment, the country focused on achieving international recognition of Jerusalem as its capital, said Jonathan Grossman, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Institute for Israel Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. He has researched ties between Israel and Latin America. “Latin America was a major target in this struggle because they were mostly very friendly toward Israel,” Grossman said. The campaign was successful and some 11 Latin American countries opened up embassies in Jerusalem, starting with Guatemala in 1948. Advertisement But ties soured in 1967, following the Six-Day War, which drew wide international condemnation. Then in 1980, when the Knesset passed a law that declared the entire city of Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital, all the Latin American countries as well as the Netherlands and Haiti, decided to move their embassies out of Jerusalem. Venezuela turned hostile under its late dictator, Hugo Chavez, and ties between Argentina and Israel have blown hot and cold since the the 1992 terrorist attack on Israel’s embassy in and the 1994 bombing of the AMIA Jewish center, both in Buenos Aires. The last 15 years have once again seen improved ties between Israel and some Latin American countries, including Guatemala, Honduras and Paraguay, said Daniel Mariaschin, CEO of B’nai B’rith International, which has projects in Latin America. “The leadership in these countries in this past 15-year period has made the point of reaching out to Israel, as Israel has reached out to them,” Mariaschin said. In addition to trade interests, each of the countries’ leaders also have personal reasons for supporting Israel. Morales of Guatemala is an evangelical Christian, as is 40 percent of Guatemala’s population, and evangelicals have strong religious attachments to Israel. Paraguay’s president, Horacio Cartes, has close ties with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, and one of his campaign advisers, Ari Harow, is an Israeli-American who previously served as Netanyahu’s chief of staff. Hernandez of Honduras participated early in his career in an outreach program by Mashav, Israel’s Agency for International Development Cooperation. Grossman said that Trump’s decision opened the door for Latin American countries that have good relations with Israel to follow suit. Advertisement “This move kind of removes the barrier for many of those small countries who have excellent relations with Israel, very developed trade relations and security cooperation,” he said. Will the upcoming moves by Guatemala and Paraguay spark a trend? De Alba said it is “very highly unlikely” that a large number of Latin American countries will follow suit because such a move is seen as “too forceful.” “The position of the majority of the Latin American countries will be not to do so and try not to take sides on the [Israeli-Palestinian] conflict,” he said. Meanwhile Mariaschin thinks the Latin American countries’ decisions may lead others to at least rethink their policies. “I think these moves will spur other countries to reconsider because there’s a critical mass which is assembling here, not only in Latin America but in other places as well.”

Meanwhile Mariaschin thinks the Latin American countries’ decisions may lead others to at least rethink their policies. “I think these moves will spur other countries to reconsider because there’s a critical mass which is assembling here, not only in Latin America but in other places as well.”

News article:
(JTA) — US President Donald Trump’s decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital drew wide international criticism, with 128 countries including the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada voting in favor of a United Nations resolution condemning it. But several countries saw Trump’s decision in a different light: as an example to follow. Shortly after the United States officially moves its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on Monday, it will be joined by Guatemala and Paraguay. Both countries are planning to make the move this month, and Honduras may be next: Its Congress recently passed a resolution urging its foreign ministry to move its embassy. Along with the Czech Republic, whose president said last month it will begin the process of moving its embassy to Jerusalem, these countries belong to a small club (albeit one with a superpower). On a visit to Venezuela on Monday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas urged other Latin American countries not to move their embassies. So how come? Why do these Latin American countries go where others fear to tread? Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms Observers suggest a number of reasons, or a combination thereof: The countries are likely motivated by a desire to curry favor with the Trump administration, their leaders’ personal views of the Jewish state and strong historic ties to Israel. In the cases of Guatemala and Honduras, both countries are facing or recently faced political crises — Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales is mired in a corruption scandal and Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez’s recent re-election was dogged by allegations of voter fraud. Their leaders are looking to the US for support, said Arie Kacowicz, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem specializing in Latin America. “They pretty much need and want support and legitimacy from the US and one way of achieving that is by being on friendly, cordial or even extraordinary terms with Israel,” he told JTA. “So if the U.S. is showing the way on this particular issue of Jerusalem, the natural candidates to follow would be those two Central American countries.” Advertisement Though the countries are looking to strengthen ties with Israel, that is not their primary focus, Kacowicz said. “For Guatemala and Honduras, the US is primordial. It’s much more important than Israel,” he said. The two countries also have large immigrant populations in the US that are facing threats of deportation. Those immigrants contribute to their home countries’ economies — for example, one-tenth of Guatemala’s gross domestic product comes from remittances sent back by Guatemalans living abroad. It makes sense to want to be on the Trump administration’s good side. Moving their embassies or expressing support for doing so “is a show of good will” to Trump and the US, agreed Mariano de Alba, associate director of the Adrianne Arsht Latin America Center at the Atlantic Council, a think tank focusing on international affairs. The embassies of Guatemala, Paraguay and Honduras in Washington, DC, did not respond to requests for comment by JTA in time for publication. Trump has signaled that it cares about how other countries respond to its policies regarding Jerusalem. In December, the president said the US was watching the votes of its allies on the UN condemning his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. One hundred and twenty eight countries voted to pass the resolution with only nine — including Guatemala and Honduras — voting against it and 35 countries abstaining — including Paraguay. The resolution asserted the traditional position that “Jerusalem is a final status issue to be resolved through negotiations in line with relevant United Nations resolutions.” Advertisement Following the vote, UN ambassador Nikki Haley even threw a party for the 65 countries that did not support the resolution. The event was labeled as a means to thank the countries for “their friendship to the United States,” according to a copy of the invite obtained by CNN. But it’s not all about Trump. The three countries have ties to Israel that date back to its founding. Latin American countries were largely sympathetic to Israel in its early days, said Dina Siegel Vann, director of the American Jewish Committee’s Arthur and Rochelle Belfer Institute for Latino and Latin American Affairs. “Most Latin American countries are relatively young, and they were very much captivated by Israel’s story, a young country beating the odds after destruction in the Holocaust, and trying to make it in a very hostile environment,” Vann said. Guatemala and its UN ambassador Jorge Garcia Granados played a crucial role in the adoption of the UN partition plan for Palestine in 1947, which recommended creating a Jewish and an Arab state in pre-state Israel. In 1948, Guatemala became the first in Latin America to recognize Israel, setting off a domino effect in the region. Following Israel’s establishment, the country focused on achieving international recognition of Jerusalem as its capital, said Jonathan Grossman, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Institute for Israel Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. He has researched ties between Israel and Latin America. “Latin America was a major target in this struggle because they were mostly very friendly toward Israel,” Grossman said. The campaign was successful and some 11 Latin American countries opened up embassies in Jerusalem, starting with Guatemala in 1948. Advertisement But ties soured in 1967, following the Six-Day War, which drew wide international condemnation. Then in 1980, when the Knesset passed a law that declared the entire city of Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital, all the Latin American countries as well as the Netherlands and Haiti, decided to move their embassies out of Jerusalem. Venezuela turned hostile under its late dictator, Hugo Chavez, and ties between Argentina and Israel have blown hot and cold since the the 1992 terrorist attack on Israel’s embassy in and the 1994 bombing of the AMIA Jewish center, both in Buenos Aires. The last 15 years have once again seen improved ties between Israel and some Latin American countries, including Guatemala, Honduras and Paraguay, said Daniel Mariaschin, CEO of B’nai B’rith International, which has projects in Latin America. “The leadership in these countries in this past 15-year period has made the point of reaching out to Israel, as Israel has reached out to them,” Mariaschin said. In addition to trade interests, each of the countries’ leaders also have personal reasons for supporting Israel. Morales of Guatemala is an evangelical Christian, as is 40 percent of Guatemala’s population, and evangelicals have strong religious attachments to Israel. Paraguay’s president, Horacio Cartes, has close ties with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, and one of his campaign advisers, Ari Harow, is an Israeli-American who previously served as Netanyahu’s chief of staff. Hernandez of Honduras participated early in his career in an outreach program by Mashav, Israel’s Agency for International Development Cooperation. Grossman said that Trump’s decision opened the door for Latin American countries that have good relations with Israel to follow suit.

News article:
Following the relocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem this coming Monday, Guatemala is planning to make a similar move on Wednesday and open its own new embassy in Jerusalem’s Malha Technological Park. “Historically, we believe this is the right step and the right thing to do,” Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales told Israel Hayom in an exclusive interview. The embassy move comes on a particularly hectic week: In a downpour of diplomatic and security events, Israel will hold Jerusalem Day celebrations on Sunday, the Palestinians will commemorate “Nakba Day” on Monday (Nakba meaning “catastrophe” in Arabic, refers to the calamity that befell the Palestinians with the establishment of Israel), and Muslims will mark the start of Ramadan on Wednesday. Guatemala, a small and relatively little-known Central American country, indicated it would follow America’s lead just two days after U.S. President Donald Trump’s historic announcement recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel last December. Ahead of a historic state visit to Israel, Morales revealed what prompted his decision: “When I heard that President Trump decided to sign and approve the transfer of the embassy, I said to myself that that’s a brave step.” Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories “Of course, then the usual problems began … There was opposition in the United Nations and many people did not like it, but we said that we believe this is how it should be. So we also declared our intention to bring our embassy back to Jerusalem. It is important to note this word choice, ‘bring back,’ as our first embassy, which opened after the founding of the State of Israel, was in Jerusalem.” Q: Correct. About 40 years ago, Guatemala’s former President Eugenio Garcia transferred the Guatemalan Embassy to Tel Aviv. In hindsight, do you believe that this move was a mistake? A: These are presidential decisions, and many people would judge each and every one. This was the presidential decision then, and now we are coming to another presidential decision. Q: When I interviewed President Donald Trump in the White House after his first year in office, I asked him what he felt was the highlight of his presidency, and he answered without hesitating: “Having Jerusalem be your great capital.” What would you describe as the highlight of your term? A: One of the biggest highlights, without a doubt, is bringing back our embassy to Jerusalem. Besides that, we have historical matters, such as the territorial conflict we have with Belize, which is a problem we have had for over 200 years. Recently we conducted a referendum to decide whether to submit this matter to an international court. I believe that these are the biggest decisions I made as president. Q: Following up on this historic decision, did you speak about this subject with other Latin American countries? A: Yes, there are many conversations being held on the subject and much curiosity on the part of other leaders. I understood that a lot of leaders are considering similar moves, and I assume that some of them will declare similar moves soon, but I must keep the conversations confidential. Q: You returned recently from Costa Rica. Is Costa Rica next to relocate its embassy? We’ll keep it between us … A: I don’t know. This is relatively new, I don’t know how he [Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado] will move forward on this matter. I do know that our people are pleased with our decision to go from talk to action. That is what history judges. Q: Everything has a price. Israelis are pleased, but the Palestinians less so, as are some other countries. Since arriving at this decision, have there been repercussions? A: Decisions always come with a price. We support our allies and we support the countries that we view as our friends—as our brothers in many ways. It is customary to say, “Always love your friends,” so when Israel needs us more than ever, like now, we show up. The Republic of Guatemala—five times the size of Israel with a population that numbers some 16 million people—is considered a small country on a global scale. But it had a big hand in the historical U.N. vote to establish the State of Israel 70 years ago. Guatemala’s ambassador to the U.N. at the time worked to enlist the support of Latin American states for the partition plan. Out of 17 states within the bloc, 11 voted in favor and none opposed. Q: Israel and Guatemala are very far from one another geographically, but are close in their political positions. How do you explain this? A: Our countries are very close at heart, and we have between us a connection of thought, like with other countries. The U.S., Israel and Guatemala, we all love freedom. I believe that Guatemala has strong roots in accepting the Jewish people. It has a lot to do with faith. Here, more than 93 percent of the citizens are Christian—49 percent are Catholic and 45 percent are evangelical. Our passion for religion comes with great appreciation and admiration for peoples like the people of Israel. If we talk about historical matters or right decisions we must remember that in 1947, Guatemala voted in favor of the State of Israel in its struggle over its founding and since then we have maintained very warm relations—political, diplomatic, cultural and economic. Today, even though many political commentators criticize our decision on the embassy as wrong, the vast majority of our people are pleased that this is happening. This will provide the two countries with motivation to strengthen the ties between them. Q: After your current move, can Israel expect Guatemala to vote in international organizations, such as the U.N., alongside the U.S. and Israel? A: We gave support unequivocally in this matter, and we will continue doing so on every vote on the matter. Clearly we will consider every vote in and of itself, because we are responsible. As president of Guatemala, my biggest responsibility is to Guatemala and the principle that guides me is to do what is right for us. The decision to bring our embassy back to Jerusalem is the right step, and it also will strengthen our international standing and our relationship and ties with Israeli. Q: Ahead of your visit to the region there is a threat of bombs and rockets. The situation with Syria and Iran is not at all quiet, to put it mildly. A: I know that the situation is not simple at the moment, but I hope that everything will be all right soon. James Ernesto Morales Cabrera, 49 years old, legally changed his name to Jimmy Morales in 2011, at the peak of his career as a successful comedian in a popular Guatemalan television series. That year, he also crossed the lines and entered politics with a run for municipal elections and, only four years later, in October 2015, was elected in a landslide victory of 73 percent to become the 37th president of Guatemala. Q: When you won the 2015 election, you were not the leading candidate and this was a surprise to many people. You come from the outside, from the world of television and comedy. Meanwhile, leaders like Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron and 31-year-old Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz have been elected. In your opinion, what is going on in the world now that people have gotten fed up by politicians and now want a new kind of leader? How would you explain this phenomenon? A: Apparently, the modern world needs new figures who can do things differently than the politicians who came before them. The proof is that presidential decisions are different than what previous presidents have decided. I think that the wishes of the different peoples were translated into different decisions and actions than what we are used to, and they will be judged by history.

News article:
Morales' visit comes amid violent protests in the Gaza Strip triggered by the opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem on Monday, when Israel celebrated its 70th anniversary. Over 60 protestors, including several children, were killed and more than 2,700 others were injured in clashes with Israeli forces. The latter has blamed the Hamas Palestinian militant group for the erupted violence by organizing provocations. The militants, in their turn, have sent indirect messages to Israel hinting that it can tone down the massive Gaza protests which are expected to be further galvanized on Tuesday. According to the latest IDF report, at least 24 people, whose involvement in terrorism-related activities has been documented, were killed on Monday by Israeli servicemen. "IDF and ISA [Israel Securities Authority] inquiries reveal that at least 24 terrorists with documented terror backgrounds were killed during the violent riots along the Gaza border on Monday. Most were active Hamas terror organization operatives, and some were active operatives of Palestinian Islamic Jihad," the IDF said on its Twitter account. Yesterday afternoon, the IDF received intelligence that Hamas operatives were preparing to cross through the security fence from northern Gaza.

News article:
Jerusalem – Guatemala festively opened its new embassy in Jerusalem on Wednesday, becoming the second country to do so after the United States, and giving Israel a diplomatic boost as it faces international criticism for the deadly violence on the Gaza border. Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales dedicated the embassy just two days after a high-powered American delegation also marked the transfer of its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was fitting since Guatemala also followed the U.S. to be the second country to recognize Israel 70 years ago. “You were always among the first,” he said at the ceremony. “We remember our friends and Guatemala is our friend, then and now.” President Donald Trump announced his decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the American embassy there, triggering a joyous reaction from Netanyahu’s government. Israel has always claimed Jerusalem as its capital yet most countries opted to place their embassies in coastal Tel Aviv because of the holy city’s contested status. Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and view the relocation of the embassy as a one-sided move that invalidates the U.S. as a Mideast peace broker. The embassy move added fuel to the weekly Palestinian protests in Gaza demanding the right of return to Israel and the lifting of a decade-old naval blockade. They culminated Monday when Israel killed nearly 60 Palestinians in clashes along the border. The Gaza protesters set tires ablaze, sending up thick plumes of black smoke, and hurled firebombs and stones toward Israeli troops across the border. The Israeli military, which has come under international criticism for firing on unarmed protesters, said Hamas militants tried to carry out bombing and shooting attacks under the cover of the protests and released video of protesters ripping away parts of the barbed-wire border fence. The military said 14 of those killed Monday were actively involved in carrying out attacks. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel did everything it could to prevent civilian casualties but that Gaza’s Hamas rulers were to blame for using them as human shields. “The Hamas leadership is a group of cannibals who treat their children as armament,” he said during a visit to a military base in southern Israel. “They have rocket armament, personal armament and another kind of armament — their children and women.” Since the Hamas-led protests began on March 30, more than 110 Palestinians have been killed and more than 2,500 wounded by live fire, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Palestinian officials say the vast majority of the casualties have been unarmed protesters. The heavy death toll Monday, along with hundreds of wounded, made it by far the bloodiest day of cross-border violence since a devastating 2014 war between Israel and Hamas. It also triggered a diplomatic backlash against Israel. The U.N. Security Council held a special session that began with a moment of silence for the Palestinians who were killed. In Geneva, the U.N. human rights office said Israel has repeatedly violated international norms by using deadly live fire to repel protesters. Turkey expelled Israel’s ambassador and consul general and several European countries summoned the Israeli ambassadors to their foreign ministries for questioning and called for an international investigation. The diplomatic spat with Turkey intensifed after what Israel called the humiliating treatment of its ambassador, who was subjected to a severe security screening upon his departure from the airport in Istanbul. The event was intentionally captured by Turkish media. In response, Israel has summoned a top Turkish diplomat to be reprimanded. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long been a fierce critic of Israel and dramatically ratcheted up his rhetoric this week over Gaza and the U.S. embassy move. Netanyahu retorted that a “man whose hands are drenched in the blood of countless Kurdish civilians in Turkey and Syria is the last one who can preach to us about military ethics.” At the same time, Israel has found other nations following the U.S. lead and rallying to its defense. Besides Guatemala, Paraguay says it will also relocate its embassy to Jerusalem and Romania, the Czech Republic and Honduras have said they are considering doing the same. At Wednesday’s ceremony, Morales said his country was bringing a message of “love, peace and fraternity” to Israel. The Guatemalan Congress recently passed a law marking May 14 as “Israel-Guatemala Friendship Day.” Marking the move, the Jerusalem municipality illuminated the walls of the Old City walls late Tuesday with flags of Guatemala, Israel and the United States and a message thanking Morales.

The image shows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaking at the opening of Guatemala's new embassy in Jerusalem. This event is part of a series of recent events in which countries have been moving their embassies to Jerusalem, following the United States' lead. This has caused a great deal of controversy, as the status of Jerusalem is disputed between Israel and the Palestinians. The image is complementary to the news events set because it provides a visual representation of one of the key events in the set. The image also helps to illustrate the overall theme of the news events set, which is the changing status of Jerusalem.


News article:
Jerusalem – Guatemala festively opened its new embassy in Jerusalem on Wednesday, becoming the second country to do so after the United States, and giving Israel a diplomatic boost as it faces international criticism for the deadly violence on the Gaza border. Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales dedicated the embassy just two days after a high-powered American delegation also marked the transfer of its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was fitting since Guatemala also followed the U.S. to be the second country to recognize Israel 70 years ago. “You were always among the first,” he said at the ceremony. “We remember our friends and Guatemala is our friend, then and now.” President Donald Trump announced his decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the American embassy there, triggering a joyous reaction from Netanyahu’s government. Israel has always claimed Jerusalem as its capital yet most countries opted to place their embassies in coastal Tel Aviv because of the holy city’s contested status. Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and view the relocation of the embassy as a one-sided move that invalidates the U.S. as a Mideast peace broker. The embassy move added fuel to the weekly Palestinian protests in Gaza demanding the right of return to Israel and the lifting of a decade-old naval blockade. They culminated Monday when Israel killed nearly 60 Palestinians in clashes along the border. The Gaza protesters set tires ablaze, sending up thick plumes of black smoke, and hurled firebombs and stones toward Israeli troops across the border. The Israeli military, which has come under international criticism for firing on unarmed protesters, said Hamas militants tried to carry out bombing and shooting attacks under the cover of the protests and released video of protesters ripping away parts of the barbed-wire border fence. The military said 14 of those killed Monday were actively involved in carrying out attacks. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel did everything it could to prevent civilian casualties but that Gaza’s Hamas rulers were to blame for using them as human shields. “The Hamas leadership is a group of cannibals who treat their children as armament,” he said during a visit to a military base in southern Israel. “They have rocket armament, personal armament and another kind of armament — their children and women.” Since the Hamas-led protests began on March 30, more than 110 Palestinians have been killed and more than 2,500 wounded by live fire, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Palestinian officials say the vast majority of the casualties have been unarmed protesters. The heavy death toll Monday, along with hundreds of wounded, made it by far the bloodiest day of cross-border violence since a devastating 2014 war between Israel and Hamas. It also triggered a diplomatic backlash against Israel. The U.N. Security Council held a special session that began with a moment of silence for the Palestinians who were killed. In Geneva, the U.N. human rights office said Israel has repeatedly violated international norms by using deadly live fire to repel protesters. Turkey expelled Israel’s ambassador and consul general and several European countries summoned the Israeli ambassadors to their foreign ministries for questioning and called for an international investigation. The diplomatic spat with Turkey intensifed after what Israel called the humiliating treatment of its ambassador, who was subjected to a severe security screening upon his departure from the airport in Istanbul. The event was intentionally captured by Turkish media. In response, Israel has summoned a top Turkish diplomat to be reprimanded. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long been a fierce critic of Israel and dramatically ratcheted up his rhetoric this week over Gaza and the U.S. embassy move. Netanyahu retorted that a “man whose hands are drenched in the blood of countless Kurdish civilians in Turkey and Syria is the last one who can preach to us about military ethics.” At the same time, Israel has found other nations following the U.S. lead and rallying to its defense. Besides Guatemala, Paraguay says it will also relocate its embassy to Jerusalem and Romania, the Czech Republic and Honduras have said they are considering doing the same. At Wednesday’s ceremony, Morales said his country was bringing a message of “love, peace and fraternity” to Israel. The Guatemalan Congress recently passed a law marking May 14 as “Israel-Guatemala Friendship Day.” Marking the move, the Jerusalem municipality illuminated the walls of the Old City walls late Tuesday with flags of Guatemala, Israel and the United States and a message thanking Morales.

JERUSALEM (JTA) — Guatemala inaugurated its embassy in Jerusalem, the second country to move its main diplomatic mission from Tel Aviv. Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales attended the opening Wednesday morning of the embassy in the Technological Park of southern Jerusalem’s Malha neighborhood. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed Morales and his delegation in Spanish with “Buenas Dias,” which means good day in Spanish, before switching to English. “This is the beginning of something extraordinary, or I would say, the re-beginning of something extraordinary, which is the relationship between Guatemala and Israel,” he said. Netanyahu noted that Guatemala was the second country behind the United States to recognize Israel’s independence after the partition vote in the United Nations. The United States opened its Jerusalem embassy in the southern Jerusalem’s Arnona neighborhood on Monday. Netanyahu told Morales that he would visit Guatemala on his next trip to Latin America. Guatemala previously had an embassy in Jerusalem, the first country in the world to open an embassy in the city in 1956. It closed in 1980 following a United Nations Security Council resolution that called for such closures. Before the ceremony, Netanyahu and Morales held a private meeting. They were scheduled to meet after the ceremony with their entourages. Paraguay is scheduled to open a Jerusalem embassy on May 21 with its president, Horacio Cartes, due to be in attendance.

In his remarks, Netanyahu highlighted the friendly relationship that both countries have shared since 1948 when Guatemala became the second country, after the U.S., to recognize the State of Israel. Netanyahu mentioned that in Israel, there is a Guatemala Street “about a kilometer from here in Jerusalem” and in many Israeli cities in honor of former Guatemalan Ambassador to the United Nations Jorge Garcia Granados, who was critical in convincing Latin American countries to favorably vote for General Assembly Resolution 181 which called for the partition of Mandatory Palestine into a Jewish state and Arab state. “We remember our friends, and Guatemala is our friend — then and now,” Netanyahu said. At the ceremony, Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales highlighted the friendly relationship that the U.S, Israel and Guatemala share: “70 years ago the US and Guatemala voted in favor of partition,” he said. “Three friends that share friendship and loyalty.” Was very pleased to meet today with President Morales of Guatemala.

News article:
Earlier it was reported that Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales arrived in Israel amid violent protests in the Gaza Strip triggered by the opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem. Over 60 people, including several children, were killed and more than 2,700 others were injured in clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli forces. Israel considers Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern districts of the city, which the Israelis seized from Jordan during the Six-Day War in 1967. The international community does not recognize the annexation of East Jerusalem and believes that the status of the city should be determined based on an agreement with the Palestinians, which claim the eastern part of Jerusalem.

News article:
Just two days after the United States opened its embassy in Jerusalem to much fanfare, Guatemala made its move to open its embassy in the Israeli capital. Guatemala’s President Jimmy Morales said: “With the opening of our embassy in the city of Jerusalem, Guatemala takes a courageous decision, a step forward in favor of union and friendship. This decision will be a legacy that will bring great benefits to everyone.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the opening “a great day” for both Israel and Guatemala. “I welcome my friend President Jimmy Morales,” he said. “Guatemala was with us at the beginning, and Guatemala is with us today, and we welcome the opening of the embassy in Jerusalem.” Despite being a small and largely impoverished Central American country, Guatemala has long represented an important partner for Israel. In 1947, it became one of the first countries to voice support for the creation of the Jewish state; in 1956, it became one of the first Latin American countries to open an embassy in Jerusalem, although it later relocated the mission in 1978 to the Tel Aviv suburb of Herzliya. Today, as Israel is attempting to build nontraditional allies around the world, Guatemala has expressed an interest in bolstering agriculture, science, technology and security ties with the Israelis. Following Guatemala and the United States, Paraguay plans to move its embassy by the end of the month, while leaders in Romania, Czech Republic and Honduras are also contemplating a move.

News article:
Israeli security forces stand guard outside the US consulate in Jerusalem. AFP Tel Aviv - Asharq Al-Awsat Paraguay's Foreign Minister Eladio Loizaga Caballero has said that his country will open the country's new embassy to Israel in Jerusalem on Tuesday, following similar steps by the United States and Guatemala. But the minister denied that the embassy opening was linked to the US and Guatemalan decision to inaugurate their missions in Jerusalem. He told the Israeli media on Thursday that the decision on the embassy move was taken for “technical reasons” eight months ago. The Paraguayan decision to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem does not stop the country from having “strong and close relations” with the Palestinians, the minister insisted. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely said that all embassies in Tel Aviv would move to Jerusalem within the coming years. She thanked the US administration for “exerting strong efforts to convince our friends in several countries to move their embassies to Jerusalem because it knows its importance for Israel.” In December, US President Donald Trump sparked global controversy by announcing that the United States would move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

She thanked the US administration for “exerting strong efforts to convince our friends in several countries to move their embassies to Jerusalem because it knows its importance for Israel.” In December, US President Donald Trump sparked global controversy by announcing that the United States would move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

Israeli security forces stand guard outside the US consulate in Jerusalem. AFP Tel Aviv - Asharq Al-Awsat Paraguay's Foreign Minister Eladio Loizaga Caballero has said that his country will open the country's new embassy to Israel in Jerusalem on Tuesday, following similar steps by the United States and Guatemala. But the minister denied that the embassy opening was linked to the US and Guatemalan decision to inaugurate their missions in Jerusalem. He told the Israeli media on Thursday that the decision on the embassy move was taken for “technical reasons” eight months ago. The Paraguayan decision to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem does not stop the country from having “strong and close relations” with the Palestinians, the minister insisted. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely said that all embassies in Tel Aviv would move to Jerusalem within the coming years.

Paraguay’s President Horacio Cartes arrived in Israel Sunday evening ahead of the opening of his country’s embassy in Jerusalem this week. Cartes was greeted at the airport by Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, who praised him for moving the Paraguayan embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. “I thanked the president for his decision that testifies to the depth of countries’ ties and his brave leadership. Another state leader that chooses truth and strengthens our sovereignty in our capital,” Erdan tweeted. Paraguay is set to open its new mission in Jerusalem on Monday, making it the third country to do so after the United States and Guatemala opened their embassies in the city last week.

News article:
Paraguay opened its Israel embassy in Jerusalem on Monday, the second country to follow the United States in making the politically sensitive move from Tel Aviv. Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended the inauguration ceremony. The United States relocated its embassy to Jerusalem a week ago, drawing Palestinian anger, and was followed by Guatemala on Wednesday. Israel's Foreign Ministry called the moves a sign of the "extraordinary times". The move has received a mixed response at home in Paraguay where Mr Cartes is set to be replaced by president-elect Mario Abdo Benitez in less than two months. Mr Benitez said he had not been consulted about the move. Dr. Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Executive Committee, called on Paraguay to reverse course and change its decision. "Paraguay has conspired with Israel, the United States and Guatemala to entrench the military occupation and to seal the fate of occupied Jerusalem," Ms Ashrawi said. “We call on Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes to retract his decision and take the necessary steps to hold Israel accountable for its flagrant violations of human rights and crimes against humanity”. __________ Read more: 'Why did you leave me?' Family mourns baby killed by Israeli tear gas Israel kills dozens in Gaza as US moves embassy to Jerusalem Paralysed protesters are without hope at Gaza's Al Shifa hospital __________ Israel claims the holy site to be its undivided capital. But Palestinians seek East Jerusalem as the capital of any future state, alongside the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. East Jerusalem is host to holy sites revered by both Jews and Muslims, particularly the Noble Sanctuary, or Haram Al Sharif, that Jews also refer to as the Temple Mount. The international consensus, which US President Donald Trump broke with by moving the embassy, is that the status of the city should be negotiated through bilateral negotiations. Most countries keep their embassies in Tel Aviv and have rejected the idea of relocating their diplomatic missions away from the city unilaterally. The other countries that have expressed an interest in moving their missions to Jerusalem include Honduras, Czech Republic and Romania. At the US embassy inauguration last week, Mr Trump said the move had been a long time coming. But just miles away in Gaza, tens of thousands of Palestinian protesters rallied against the move and conditions in the enclave. Israeli forces shot 60 people dead, including several children, sparking international outrage.

News article:
On Monday, Paraguay became the third country to open its embassy in Jerusalem, The Jerusalem Post reported. Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes, along with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, opened the embassy in the Malha Technological Park, the same building where Guatemala inaugurated its embassy in Jerusalem last week. During the ceremony, Netanyahu noted that Paraguay is a “true friend” of Israel. He recalled that Paraguay helped Jews escape Nazi Germany before and during the Holocaust and supported Israel during the partition vote in the UN in 1947. “Paraguay, before but especially under your leadership, took a very bold stance in international affairs and refused to cooperate with the lies directed against Israel,” Netanyahu said. Meanwhile, in his speech, Cartes indicated that the embassy opening “expresses the sincere friendship and brave solidarity” between the two countries. He also said: “From the depth of my heart, I appreciate this country that courageously defends its right to live in peace and it is building a praiseworthy economically prosperous state that ensures its future and that of its children.” During his ceremony speech, Netanyahu indicated that cooperation with Paraguay would be “greater in several areas including agriculture, security and technology.” In 2016, Cartes became the first Paraguayan president to visit Israel. The President and Prime Minister met for a second time in 2017 in Buenos Aires on Netanyahu’s first trip to Latin America. Paraguay’s embassy opening comes exactly one week after the United States opened its embassy in an existing consular building in the neighborhood of Arnona in Jerusalem, an area which has been in the hands of Israel since 1948. Two days later, Guatemala opened its embassy in Jerusalem as well. Other countries have expressed desire to move their embassies to Jerusalem including the Czech Republic and Romania. In upcoming weeks, it is expected that Honduras will announce its embassy move to Jerusalem. [Photo: YouTube/ euronews]

News article:
Source: Xinhua| 2018-05-21 22:08:42|Editor: Xiang Bo Video Player Close JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Paraguay opened its embassy to Israel in Jerusalem Monday, becoming the third country to do so following the United States and Guatemala. Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes, who arrived in Israel Sunday evening, opened the embassy along with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Malha Technological Park, the same building in which Guatemala opened its embassy in Jerusalem last week. On May 14, the United Stated opened its embassy in what Israel claims to be the capital of the Jewish country --Jerusalem. Wide-spread protests broke out in West Bank cities and Gaza. According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, more than 60 were killed and over 3,000 wounded due to clashes with the Israeli Defense Forces. Israel seized East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War, along with the rest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. It later annexed East Jerusalem and declared it as part of its "eternal and indivisible capital," in a move that has never been recognized by the international community. Palestinians, who make up more than one third of the city's overall population, consider East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. The peace talks between Palestine and Israel have been stalled since April 2014. The U.S.-sponsored talks that lasted for nine months achieved no tangible results.

Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes, who arrived in Israel Sunday evening, opened the embassy along with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Malha Technological Park, the same building in which Guatemala opened its embassy in Jerusalem last week. On May 14, the United Stated opened its embassy in what Israel claims to be the capital of the Jewish country --Jerusalem. Wide-spread protests broke out in West Bank cities and Gaza. According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, more than 60 were killed and over 3,000 wounded due to clashes with the Israeli Defense Forces. Israel seized East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War, along with the rest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. It later annexed East Jerusalem and declared it as part of its "eternal and indivisible capital," in a move that has never been recognized by the international community. Palestinians, who make up more than one third of the city's overall population, consider East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. The peace talks between Palestine and Israel have been stalled since April 2014. The U.S.-sponsored talks that lasted for nine months achieved no tangible results.

Jerusalem – Paraguay opened its new embassy in Jerusalem on Monday, following in the footsteps of the United States and Guatemala. President Horacio Cartes dedicated the embassy, making Paraguay the third country to transfer its diplomatic mission in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Romania, the Czech Republic and Honduras have said they are also considering doing the same. President Donald Trump’s announcement on Jerusalem in December was welcomed by the Israeli government. But it infuriated the Palestinians, who claim Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem as their future capital. The U.S. Embassy move added fuel to the weekly Palestinian protests in Gaza demanding the right of return to Israel and the lifting of a decade-old naval blockade. The protests culminated last Monday, when Israeli forces killed nearly 60 Palestinians in clashes along the border. The heavy death toll triggered a diplomatic backlash, with Turkey expelling Israel’s ambassador and consul general and several European countries summoning the Israeli ambassadors to their foreign ministries for questioning. But the U.S. Embassy move has also sparked others to rally in support of Israel. The entrance to Jerusalem was lined with the flags of Paraguay on Wednesday and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the ceremony that he was there to “salute” a great friend. The opening of the embassy was “a great day for Israel, a great day for Paraguay, a great day for our friendship,” Netanyahu said.

JNS.org – The White House issued a statement on Tuesday night praising Paraguay for relocating its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were in attendance at the May 21 inauguration, just five days after the Guatemalan embassy opening in Jerusalem, and a week after America became the first country to move its embassy to Jerusalem in an internationally televised event. “We thank our Western Hemisphere partner for joining us in recognizing Israel’s capital and encouraging additional moves,” the statement said. “By being the first head of state to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to open an embassy there on May 14, 2018, President [Donald] Trump reprised the role President [Harry] Truman played 70 years ago when he was the first to recognize the State of Israel.” The statement concluded that the United States hopes to welcome “many more of our friends and allies in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel.” The Palestinian Authority, on the other hand, blasted Paraguay for the move, which they called “illegal, illegitimate, an act of aggression against the Palestinian people and their rights, a violation of relevant United Nations resolutions and international law, and submission to American and Israeli dictates and bribes.”

By World Israel News Guatemala made history on Wednesday when it moved its embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, two days after the US made the same move. Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin and several heads of state from both countries were present at the momentous ceremony. "It is not a coincidence that Guatemala is opening its embassy in Jerusalem two days after the US. You are always among the first," Netanyahu said. Guatemala supported the creation of the State of Israel in 1948 and was the second country to recognize it, after the US. "We remember our friends and Guatemala is our friend, then and now." "We share so many goals and values even though were are so far away," Netanyahu stated, saying he would advance the bilateral relationship in "practical ways." In his address, Morales described the relationship between the two countries as the "love between brothers." The embassy is located in Jerusalem's Malha Technological Park. Guatemalan Embassy, welcome home! Guatemala was the first country in the world to open an embassy in Jerusalem in 1956, but moved it to Tel Aviv in 1980, so in essence, it is returning to the capital. "Guatemalan Embassy, welcome home! Ahead of the inauguration of the embassy, we have illuminated the walls of the Old City with the flags of Guatemala and Israel," Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat stated on Tuesday. Barkat thanked Morales for his "courageous decision" and called upon other countries to join the US and Guatemala in doing the "right thing." Shortly after taking office in 2015, Morales, a devout evangelical Christian, visited a synagogue in Guatemala City, where he announced his intention to visit Israel. He made the historic trip in November 2016. Guatemala was one of the nine nations to vote against a United Nations resolution that condemned the US for Trump's historic recognition of Jerusalem. Guatemala will be joined by Paraguay and Honduras in committing to the move. The Czech Republic has also expressed interest; however, its government has not issued a unified statement. Liviu Dragnea of the Social Democratic Party, which effectively runs Romania's government, said Bucharest was ready to move the embassy. In April 2017, the Russian Foreign Ministry made a similar move to recognize "west Jerusalem" as the Israeli capital.

GUATEMALA CITY — United States casino magnate Sheldon Adelson provided Guatemala’s official delegation a Boeing 767 to travel to Israel for the relocation of its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a Guatemalan government official said Friday. Guatemalan foreign minister Sandra Jovel said Adelson provided the plane last week to carry government officials and guests, including religious leaders. Jovel made the comments on radio show ConCriterio, ending days of speculation in Guatemala about who paid for the trip. Manfredo Marroquin, director of civil society organization Citizen Action, said President Jimmy Morales’s administration violated Guatemalan law, which forbids accepting such gifts. Guatemala’s human rights prosecutor, Jordan Rodas, also said the arrangement with Adelson was concerning.

News article:
An Alexandria military court issued on Tuesday preliminary death sentences against 36 people convicted of involvement in deadly bombings on two Egyptian churches in Alexandria and Tanta in April 2017. The case involves 48 defendants, 31 of whom are in custody and 17 are fugitives. The court has referred the case to the country's Grand Mufti for his non-binding opinion on the death sentence as per Egyptian law. The verdict is subject to appeal. According to the prosecution, a number of the defendants formed an illegal group that calls for the suspension of the law and the constitution, the obstruction of state institutions from carrying out their duties, and assaulting the personal freedom of citizens. The prosecution charged three of the defendants with training a number of the group’s members in manufacturing explosives, using weaponry, and combat tactics at training camps. The defendants were convicted of a number of terrorist attacks against civilians and policemen in 2016 and 2017. In April 2017, suicide bombers attacked St George's Church in Tanta and St Mark's Cathedral in Alexandria on Palm Sunday, killing 46 people and injuring dozens. Both attacks were claimed by the Daesh terrorist group. One day after the April attacks, the interior ministry said that police had killed seven members of a terrorist cell involved in the bombings in a shootout in Upper Egypt's Assiut governorate. A three-month state of emergency – which has since been renewed every three months – was declared by President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi on the day of the church attacks. The defendants were also charged with participating in a January 2017 attack on a security checkpoint in Egypt’s New Valley governorate near the Western Desert, killing eight policemen. The attack on the Naqb checkpoint took place some 80 kilometres away from the provincial capital of Al-Kharga, and more than 600 kilometres southwest of Cairo. Search Keywords: Short link:

People look at the damage caused by the bomb in front of a church in Alexandria, Egypt in April 2017. (Reuters) Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt’s military criminal court referred on Tuesday the cases of 36 members of the ISIS terrorist group to the Grand Mufti after they were sentenced to death for attacks against churches in the country. The defendants are suspected of involvement in bombings that hit three Coptic churches - one at Cairo’s Coptic Cathedral in December 2016 that killed at least 25, and two that hit churches in Alexandria and Tanta on the same day in April 2017 and killed more than 45 people. Egypt requires that courts refer cases to the Grand Mufti for consideration of the death penalty ahead of a final verdict although his decision is non-binding. The court will issue a final verdict on May 15. Eleven of the 36 are being tried in absentia, a lawyer involved in the case told Reuters. Public prosecutor Nabil Sadek said previously that some of the suspects held leadership positions in ISIS and formed cells in Cairo and the southern province of Qena to carry out the church attacks. Some of the defendants are also accused of carrying out an attack on a checkpoint in Egypt’s Western Desert that killed at least eight policemen in 2017.

Egypt's former anti-corruption chief Hisham Geneina speaks with AFP in Cairo on June 23, 2016 Egyptian former anti-corruption chief Hisham Geneina will face military trial after saying a presidential candidate he supported had documents damning to state officials, his lawyer said on Thursday. The military had detained Geneina in February following his remarks in an interview with Huffpost Arabi, the Arabic version of the US news site. He will stand trial on April 16 on charges of "spreading news that harms the armed forces," his lawyer Ali Taha said. Geneina had been a top campaign aide to Sami Anan, whom the military also detained after he announced he would stand in last month's presidential election against incumbent Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who won overwhelmingly. Geneina had said the documents Anan allegedly possessed "revolve around political events and crises Egyptian society has passed through" since the January 2011 uprising which toppled veteran strongman Hosni Mubarak. He said they were held at a "secure" place abroad and could be released if Anan is harmed. Moataz Wadnan, the journalist who conducted the interview, has also been arrested.

News article:
CAIRO, April 12 (Reuters) - Egypt's former anti-corruption chief has been referred to a military court for trial on charges of spreading false news harmful to the military establishment, his lawyer said Thursday. Hisham Genena ran alongside former military chief-of-staff Sami Anan as a member of his short-lived presidential campaign before the latter was detained in January and accused by the army of running for office without permission, bringing his bid to a halt. Genena was arrested and put under investigation by the military prosecutor in February over comments he had allegedly made in an interview with the HuffPost Arabi news website. In the interview, Genena said Anan possessed documents that were damning of senior Egyptian officials. He gave no details. Anan's lawyer criticised Genena and wrote on his Facebook page that statements Genena made were "completely untrue". He did not say which statements he referred to (nL8N1Q34M0). The former auditor was beaten up outside his home shortly after Anan's arrest and has accused the government of being behind his assault. His alleged assailants said his injuries were the result of a fight after a car accident (nL4N1PV4R4). Genena's lawyer, Ali Taha, gave no further details about the charges he faced. He is due in court on April 16. Family members say he is depressed and in poor physical condition. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was re-elected in April with 97 percent of the vote.

News article:
CAIRO, April 12 (Reuters) - Egypt's former anti-corruption chief has been referred to a military court for trial on charges of spreading false news harmful to the military establishment, his lawyer said Thursday. Hisham Genena ran alongside former military chief-of-staff Sami Anan as a member of his short-lived presidential campaign before the latter was detained in January and accused by the army of running for office without permission, bringing his bid to a halt. Genena was arrested and put under investigation by the military prosecutor in February over comments he had allegedly made in an interview with the HuffPost Arabi news website. In the interview, Genena said Anan possessed documents that were damning of senior Egyptian officials. He gave no details. Anan's lawyer criticised Genena and wrote on his Facebook page that statements Genena made were "completely untrue". He did not say which statements he referred to (nL8N1Q34M0). The former auditor was beaten up outside his home shortly after Anan's arrest and has accused the government of being behind his assault. His alleged assailants said his injuries were the result of a fight after a car accident (nL4N1PV4R4). Genena's lawyer, Ali Taha, gave no further details about the charges he faced. He is due in court on April 16. Family members say he is depressed and in poor physical condition. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was re-elected in April with 97 percent of the vote.

Former Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide Mohamed Badie - Photo by: Kareem abdelAziz/Egypt Today CAIRO – 13 April 2018: Egypt’s Court of Cassation will hand down on Saturday its unchallenged ruling on the retrial of former Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide Mohamed Badie over charges of inciting violence in the “Rabaa operation room case”. Badie, along with 17 other defendants, have appealed against court verdicts ranging from life imprisonment to five years in jail. The defendants were charged of orchestrating a plan to spread chaos and violence across Egypt following the dispersal of the 2013 Rabaa and Nahda sit-ins. On May 8, 2017, the Giza Criminal Court sentenced Badie and two other defendants to life imprisonment (25 years). Meanwhile, 15 other defendants were sentenced to five years in prison each, and 21 others were acquitted. The 18 convicts have challenged the Giza Court’s ruling before the Court of Cassation. The defendants were charged with setting up an operations room to direct the movement and actions of the Brotherhood’s members in the streets after the August 2013 dispersal, and ordering the arson of churches and public properties. Badie, 74, was the eighth leader of the banned Muslim Brotherhood (MB) organization. He became leader of the organization in 2010 after the death of his predecessor, Madi Akef. He was arrested on August 19, 2013 as part of a nation-wide crackdown on Brotherhood leaders in the wake of increasing violence and protests after two Brotherhood sit-ins were forcefully dispersed on August 14, 2013. Badie was found guilty in the trial of “cutting-off Qalyoub Road”, in which 36 others were also convicted in October 2016. He is still being tried in 11 known cases, mainly over charges of “inciting violence.” However, he stated in a hearing over charges of inciting violence in Minya that he is facing 48 trials, Masrawy reported on February 28. Arab Police Station Case On May, 9 2017, the Court of Cassation revoked verdicts ranging from 10 years in prison to life against Badie and 49 co-defendants over charges of inciting violence in August 2013. The court accepted only 50 defendants’ appeals against charges of inciting violence outside the Al-Arab police station in the coastal city of Port Said; the court ordered a retrial. In August 2015, the Port Said Criminal Court handed down sentences of 25 years in prison against 95 Brotherhood leaders (19 in absentia and 76 fugitives), and 10 years in prison against 28 others; in the same trial, a total of 68 other defendants were acquitted of the charges. Espionage for Hamas Badie and former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, with 20 co-defendants, are being retried over charges of “spying” for Palestine’s Gaza-based Hamas movement. According to the prosecution, the defendants are charged with “leaking classified information” to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, Hamas and Hezbollah about national security and the Armed Forces. In the first trial, Badie was sentenced to life imprisonment, while Brotherhood leader Khairat al-Shater and two others were sentenced to death. Rabaa Dispersal Case The Criminal Court of Cairo is considering another case that is publicly known as the “Rabaa sit-in dispersal case”, in which Badie is being charged with “staging an armed gathering in Rabaa Square, illegally possessing and handling weapons, blocking driveways, and deliberately vandalizing public property, along with other counts relating to murdering policemen and citizens.” Prison Break He and 27 co-defendants are being tried in the case of breaking into Egyptian prisons, known as the break-in of the eastern border in 2011. The retrial of the defendants came after the Court of Cassation overturned in November the sentences issued by the Criminal Court to execute Morsi, Badie, his deputy Rashad al-Bayoumi, Morsi's adviser Mohye Hamed, former Parliament Speaker Mohamed el-Katatny and leading MB figure Essam el-Erian, and to punish 20 other defendants with life imprisonment. Guidance Bureau Incidents Badie and 12 other defendants are being retried by the Cairo Criminal Court over charges of inciting murder against peaceful demonstrators outside the MB Guidance Bureau in Moqattam, Cairo in 2013. In February 2015, Badie and Shater were sentenced to life imprisonment, while four others were handed down death verdicts. In January 2016, the Court of Cassation overturned the verdicts and ordered the retrial. Al-Bahr Al-Azam Case On May 27, the Cairo Criminal Court will issue its ruling in the “al-Bahr al-Azam case”, in which Badie and 13 other Brotherhood members are being retried. In September 2014, the defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment over charges of “inciting clashes” in al-Bahr al-Azam district, Giza, causing death of five people. However, the Court of Cassation overturned the verdicts on November 8, 2015. Istiqama Mosque Following the ouster of former President Morsi on July 3, 2013, pro-Muslim Brotherhood protests calling for his reinstatement clashed with security forces and residents outside Istiqama Mosque in Giza. Badie and 13 co-defendants were charged with killing 10 and attempting to murder 20 others in the clashes. On August 30, 2014, Badie and seven others were sentenced to life imprisonment, while six others were sentenced to death. The rulings were also overturned and a retrial was ordered. El Idwa Incidents Following the Rabaa sit-in dispersal on August 14, 2013, the city of El Idwa in Minya governorate witnessed acts of violence and vandalism, during which a police station was attacked and a police officer was killed. Badie is being charged over inciting violence in the clashes. The prosecution showed a violence-inciting statement signed by him. However, Badie has denied the charges. The case also includes 682 co-defendants. They are also charged with storming a number of state-owned institutions, such as the agriculture unit, veterinary center and the real estate office in the city. In April 2014, the Minya Criminal Court sentenced all defendants to death. However, a retrial was ordered after overturning the ruling by the Court of Cassation. Ismailia Incidents A total of 105 defendants, including Badie, are being tried in the “Ismailia incidents case”. They face charges of inciting violence, and killing and injuring people in clashes between pro-Muslim Brotherhood supporters and security forces outside the Brotherhood office in Ismailia in July 2014. Badie and 35 co-defendants were handed down life imprisonment sentences in May 2016. However, a retrial was ordered. Suez Incidents Badie and Brotherhood members Mohamed El-Beltagy and Safwat Hegazy were sentenced to 10 years in prison by a military court in December 2015 over charges of inciting riots. Following the Rabaa dispersal, clashes erupted between the protesters and security forces, killing five people. In 2015, the court also sentenced a total of 90 co-defendants to life imprisonment in absentia and acquitted 50 others. The appeal submitted by Badie against the ruling was accepted and a retrial was ordered. Beni Suef Incidents The Beni Suef Criminal Court is considering a retrial against Badie and 92 other defendants over charges of “setting fire” to state institutions, including a police station, a school and a prosecution building, following the dispersal of the Rabaa sit-in.

CAIRO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian top court on Tuesday removed 31 members and supporters of the currently outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group from the terrorist list over a case related to the deadly protests in 2014. The Court of Cassation removed the 31 Brotherhood loyalists from the terror list over charges of involvement in the violent protests in Cairo's Ain Shams district in early 2014 that left three citizens dead, including a female journalist, a Christian woman and a child, the official MENA news agency reported. The 2014 protests erupted after then army chief Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, now the newly reelected president, announced running for president a year after he ousted former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. In the same case, Cairo Criminal Court sentenced in February 17 defendants to 25 years in jail, nine to 15 years, four to 10 years and two to seven years while acquitting 15 of the charges of committing acts of violence. Since Morsi's ouster in early July 2013, Egypt has been facing a wave of terror attacks that have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers, as well as civilians. A Sinai-based militant group affiliated with the regional terror group Islamic State has claimed responsibility for most of the attacks. Meanwhile, the Egyptian forces have killed hundreds of terrorists and arrested thousands of suspects during the country's anti-terror war declared by Sisi following Morsi's ouster.

FILE- Former Head of Egypt's Central Auditing Organization Hesham Genena - AFP CAIRO – 19 April 2018: A military court will pronounce the verdict on Hisham Geneina, former head of the Central Auditing Organization, on April 24, over his controversial statements to HuffPost Arabi. Geneina was arrested on February 13 following his statement about Sami Anan, the now arrested former presidential candidate, where Geneina said that Anan possesses documents against the country's current leadership, which he kept outside Egypt. According to Geneina, Anan’s documents incriminate the country’s leadership in the major events that happened following the 2011 January revolution and may be leaked in case Anan is harmed. During Wednesday’s trial, Geneina’s lawyers, including Farid al Deeb, expressed objection to their client’s trial by a military court, claiming that Geneina’s case does not fall under the jurisdiction of the military court. Deeb was the lawyer of former President Hosni Mubarak, and his Interior Minister Habib al Adli who were freed following their acquittal of charges that included corruption and killing protestors. Following Geneina’s statements, military spokesperson Tamer el-Refai said that the Egyptian army will investigate the statements, saying that they drive a wedge between the Egyptian army and the citizens amid a war against terrorism. Refai added that the army will act according to the right granted to it by the constitution to preserve Egypt’s national security, dignity and honor. Anan Junior accused Geneina of slander and spreading false information on the behalf of his father. Nasser Amin, lawyer of Anan’s family, condemned Geneina’s statement, saying that all of the statements published contravene the truth and that he would take legal measures against Geneina. Former Egyptian Chief of Staff Sami Anan was arrested in January on charges of announcing his presidential bid without obtaining permits from the Armed Forces and committing forgery to be included in the presidential race.

ALGIERS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- An Algerian court has sentenced a Liberian national to death for "spying for Israel," the Algeria Press Service reported Tuesday. The case was heard by the Ghardaia Court, 600 km south of the capital Algiers, where six other individuals of different sub-Saharan nationalities were sentenced to 10 years in prison with fines of up to 20 million Algerian dinars (26,000 U.S. dollars).

Source: Xinhua| 2018-04-28 23:30:22|Editor: yan Video Player Close CAIRO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's top court upheld on Saturday the death penalty for six loyalists of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group over attacking a police station in the southern province of Minya in 2013, official MENA news agency reported. The court of cassation also reduced the execution verdicts against three defendants to 25-year imprisonment, upheld the 25-year jail for 59 defendants and acquitted 47 others. The rulings are final and unappealable, as they have been issued in response to a previous appeal by the defendants against the initial rulings of a criminal court. According to the court, the convicts stormed a police station in Minya's Matay town, stole the weapons inside, killed a senior policeman, attempted to murder others, allowed detainees to escape and finally set fire to the police station. Being supporters of ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, the convicts committed the acts of violence following the massive security dispersal of two major pro-Morsi sit-ins in Cairo and nearby Giza in August 2013 that left hundreds dead and thousands arrested. Morsi was removed by the army in early July 2013 in response to mass protests against his one-year rule and his currently blacklisted Muslim Brotherhood group. A lot of Brotherhood leaders, members and supporters, including Morsi himself and the group's top chief Mohamed Badie, are currently jailed and many have received appealable death sentences and life imprisonments over various charges varying from inciting violence and murder to espionage and jailbreak. Morsi is now serving a 20-year prison sentence over inciting deadly clashes between his supporters and opponents in late 2012 and a 25-year jail term over leaking classified documents to Qatar. Since Morsi's ouster, Egypt has been facing a wave of terror attacks that have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers as well as civilians. A Sinai-based militant group affiliated with the Islamic State regional terrorist group has claimed responsibility for most of the attacks. Meanwhile, the Egyptian forces have killed hundreds of terrorists and arrested thousands of suspects during the country's anti-terror war declared by President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the army chief then, following Morsi's ouster.

A Sinai-based militant group affiliated with the Islamic State regional terrorist group has claimed responsibility for most of the attacks. Meanwhile, the Egyptian forces have killed hundreds of terrorists and arrested thousands of suspects during the country's anti-terror war declared by President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the army chief then, following Morsi's ouster.

News article:
Source: Xinhua| 2018-04-28 23:30:22|Editor: yan Video Player Close CAIRO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's top court upheld on Saturday the death penalty for six loyalists of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group over attacking a police station in the southern province of Minya in 2013, official MENA news agency reported. The court of cassation also reduced the execution verdicts against three defendants to 25-year imprisonment, upheld the 25-year jail for 59 defendants and acquitted 47 others. The rulings are final and unappealable, as they have been issued in response to a previous appeal by the defendants against the initial rulings of a criminal court. According to the court, the convicts stormed a police station in Minya's Matay town, stole the weapons inside, killed a senior policeman, attempted to murder others, allowed detainees to escape and finally set fire to the police station. Being supporters of ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, the convicts committed the acts of violence following the massive security dispersal of two major pro-Morsi sit-ins in Cairo and nearby Giza in August 2013 that left hundreds dead and thousands arrested. Morsi was removed by the army in early July 2013 in response to mass protests against his one-year rule and his currently blacklisted Muslim Brotherhood group. A lot of Brotherhood leaders, members and supporters, including Morsi himself and the group's top chief Mohamed Badie, are currently jailed and many have received appealable death sentences and life imprisonments over various charges varying from inciting violence and murder to espionage and jailbreak. Morsi is now serving a 20-year prison sentence over inciting deadly clashes between his supporters and opponents in late 2012 and a 25-year jail term over leaking classified documents to Qatar. Since Morsi's ouster, Egypt has been facing a wave of terror attacks that have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers as well as civilians.

Rights group says arrest of Amal Fathy is a "new low in Egypt's crackdown on freedom of expression" CAIRO, May 11 (Reuters) - Egyptian police on Friday detained an activist after she posted a video on social media criticising the government for failing to protect women against sexual harassment and over worsening living conditions, Amnesty International said. The rights group said the arrest of Amal Fathy, a member of the now banned April 6 youth movement which played a role in 2011 mass protests that forced President Hosni Mubarak out of office, was a "new low in Egypt's crackdown on freedom of expression". Egyptian police could not immediately be reached for comment, but a security source said Fathy had been detained over a complaint that she had insulted the Egyptian state through an offensive social media posting. Human rights groups have repeatedly criticised Egypt's human rights situation, saying conditions in the country have continued to deteriorate under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who came to power in 2013 after the army overthrew Islamist President Mohamed Morsi following protests against his rule. Amnesty International said that in the video posted on Facebook May 9, Fathy spoke about the prevalence of sexual harassment in Egypt, criticized the government's failure to protect women and for deteriorating human rights, socioeconomic conditions and public services. "It is a dark day when the Egyptian authorities are more concerned with silencing a woman who speaks out about sexual harassment than taking steps to address the issue," said Najia Bounaim, North Africa Campaigns Director at Amnesty International. Sisi's supporters say his tough security and economic measures are needed to keep the country stable as it recovers from political chaos and tackles grave economic challenges and the Islamist insurgency. Amnesty said Fathy was detained from her home at 2:30 A.M. on Friday, together with her husband, Mohamed Lotfy -- a human rights lawyer, and were taken to a police station in Maadi in southern Cairo. Lotfy was freed some three hours later but Fathy was kept in custody to allow a prosecutor to examine her case. A prosecutor later ordered her detained for 15 days for questioning on charges of incitement to overthrow the ruling system, publishing lies and misusing social media, according to a lawyer at the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, where her husband works. Egyptian media had earlier slammed Fathy, saying she had used foul language in the 12-minute recording in which she seemed to express her anger at poor public services at a local bank, over heavy traffic, sexual harassment by a local taxi driver and over a general deterioration in living conditions. An Egyptian security source said: "She is accused and wanted for arrest in relation to complaints accusing her of insulting the Egyptian state, by publishing a posting that contained swearing and defamation against Egypt."

Cairo: An Egyptian court on Sunday acquitted two police officers of torturing to death a lawyer while in detention three years ago in a case that triggered protests from his colleagues. The ruling was issued by the Cairo Criminal Court in a retrial of the two officers, legal sources said. The ruling can be appealed, they added. The case dates back to 2015 when Kareem Hamdi, a 27-year-old lawyer, had been arrested on suspicion of belonging to the banned Muslim Brotherhood and involvement in its violence. He later died inside a police station in the northern Cairo district of Matariya, a stronghold of Islamists. Lawyers accused police of torturing Hamdi to death allegedly to extract confessions from him. They staged anti-government protests. The country’s chief prosecutor ordered both officers from the National Security Agency to stand trial on charges of torturing the lawyer to death. In December 2015, a court sentenced the two to five years in prison each. In October 2016, the Court of Cassation, Egypt’s top appeals tribunal, revoked the verdict and ordered a retrial for both defendants. Egyptian authorities have pursued a relentless crackdown on Islamists since 2013 when the military toppled president Mohammad Mursi of the Brotherhood following massive protests against his rule. Rights groups have repeatedly accused the government of ignoring police’s purported violations. Authorities have downplayed the alleged abuses as isolated acts, vowing to bring any wrongdoer to justice. In recent years, several policemen have been handed down varying jail terms in separate torture cases in Egypt. Police abuses were seen as a major catalyst for the 2011 revolt that forced long-time president Hosni Mubarak out of power.
