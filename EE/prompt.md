[0]IDF map of Hezbollah positions revealed as fabrication

[1] A map of southern Lebanon released this week by the Israeli military that ostensibly showed Hezbollah positions, infrastructure and armaments along a section of the Israeli border was a fabrication, the army admitted Thursday.The map, tweeted by the army Tuesday, appeared to feature over 200 towns and villages, which the IDF said the organization had turned into its operations bases, along with over 10,000 potential targets for Israeli strikes in the event of a new war with the terror group.“This is a war crime,” the army asserted in its tweet.A caption on the photo claimed that it had been “declassified,” in what was construed as an IDF attempt to build a case for future military action, and a warning to the terror group itself, demonstrating Israel’s superior intelligence-gathering capabilities.

[2] But on Thursday, based on an analysis by Twitter user JudgeDan48, it emerged that the map had in fact been prepared by the IDF spokesperson’s desk. The ostensible demarcations of Hezbollah positions were in fact patterns of dots, positioned on the map of southern Lebanon.Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the termshttps://twitter.com/JudgeDan48/status/806957771660804096An IDF spokesperson admitted the graphic was an “illustration” that had been misrepresented as a piece of declassified intelligence.“The illustration reflects how Hezbollah has positioned its terrorist infrastructure within the civilian arena,” the spokesperson told The Times of Israel.

While Israel hasn’t confirmed its involvement, Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman said Thursday that the military has been working to keep chemical weapons out of Hezbollah’s hands.

given the structured event10 and news trunk10: [Iran;  Engage in material cooperation;  Iraq]--[The face stares out from multiple billboards in central Baghdad, a grey-haired general casting a watchful eye across the Iraqi capital. This military commander is not Iraqi, though. He's Iranian. The posters are a recent arrival, reflecting the influence Iran now wields in Baghdad. Iraq is a mainly Arab country. Its citizens, Shi'ite and Sunni Muslims alike, have long mistrusted Iran, the Persian nation to the east. But as Baghdad struggles to fight Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), many Shi'ite Iraqis now look to Iran, a Shi'ite theocracy, as their main ally. In particular, Iraqi Shi'ites have grown to trust the powerful Iranian-backed militias that have taken charge since the Iraqi army deserted en masse last summer. Dozens of paramilitary groups have united under a secretive branch of the Iraqi government called the Popular Mobilisation Committee, or Hashid Shaabi. From its position at the nexus between Tehran, the Iraqi government, and the militias, it is increasingly influential in determining the country's future. Until now, little has been known about the body. But in a series of interviews with Reuters, key Iraqi figures inside Hashid Shaabi have detailed the ways the paramilitary groups, Baghdad and Iran collaborate, and the role Iranian advisers play both inside the group and on the frontlines. Those who spoke to Reuters include two senior figures in the Badr Organisation, perhaps the single most powerful Shi'ite paramilitary group, and the commander of a relatively new militia called Saraya al-Khorasani.In all, Hashid Shaabi oversees and coordinates several dozen factions. The insiders say most of the groups followed a call to arms by Iraq's leading Shi'ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. But they also cite the religious guidance of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, as a key factor in their decision to fight and, as they see it, defend Iraq. Hadi al-Amiri, the leader of the Badr Organisation, told Reuters: "The majority of us believe that ... Khamenei has all the qualifications as an Islamic leader. He is the leader not only for Iranians but the Islamic nation. I believe so and I take pride in it." He insisted there was no conflict between his role as an Iraqi political and military leader and his fealty to Khamenei. "Khamenei would place the interests of the Iraqi people above all else," Amiri said. Hashid Shaabi is headed by Jamal Jaafar Mohammed, better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mahdi al-Mohandis, a former Badr commander who once plotted against Saddam Hussein and whom American officials have accused of bombing the U.S. embassy in Kuwait in 1983. Iraqi officials say Mohandis is the right-hand man of Qassem Soleimani, head of the Quds Force, part of Iran's Revolutionary Guard. Mohandis is praised by some militia fighters as "the commander of all troops" whose "word is like a sword above all groups." The body he heads helps coordinate everything from logistics to military operations against ISIS.The men have known each other for more than 20 years, according to Muen al-Kadhimi, a Badr Organisation leader in western Baghdad. "If we look at this history," Kadhimi said, "it helped significantly in organizing the Hashid Shaabi and creating a force that achieved a victory that 250,000 (Iraqi) soldiers and 600,000 interior ministry police failed to do." Kadhimi said the main leadership team usually consulted for three to four weeks before major military campaigns. "We look at the battle from all directions, from first determining the field ... how to distribute assignments within the Hashid Shaabi battalions, consult battalion commanders and the logistics," he said. Soleimani, he said, "participates in the operation command center from the start of the battle to the end, and the last thing (he) does is visit the battle's wounded in the hospital."Iraqi and Kurdish officials put the number of Iranian advisers in Iraq between 100 and several hundred - fewer than the nearly 3,000 American officers training Iraqi forces. In many ways, though, the Iranians are a far more influential force. Iraqi officials say Tehran's involvement is driven by its belief that ISIS is an immediate danger to Shi'ite religious shrines not just in Iraq but also in Iran. Shrines in both nations, but especially in Iraq, rank among the sect's most sacred. The Iranians, the Iraqi officials say, helped organize the Shi'ite volunteers and militia forces after Grand Ayatollah Sistani called on Iraqis to defend their country days after ISIS seized control of the northern city of Mosul last June.They have also provided troops. Several Kurdish officials said that when ISIS fighters pushed close to the Iraq-Iran border in late summer, Iran dispatched artillery units to Iraq to fight them. Farid Asarsad, a senior official from the semi-autonomous Kurdish Regional Government, said Iranian troops often work with Iraqi forces. In northern Iraq, Kurdish peshmerga soldiers "dealt with the technical issues like identifying targets in battle, but the launching of rockets and artillery – the Iranians were the ones who did that."About the author Research Associate at Center for Islam and Global Affairs (CIGA) at Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim Universityshortlink copied Last Update: Feb 25, 2015 11:45 pmKEYWORDS world]

This was a drastic shift in policy from 2014, when a similar plan presented by then-UN envoy to the region Robert Serry was struck down.Avi Issacharoff contributed to this report.]

given the structured event15 and news trunk15: [BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corporation;  Engage in material cooperation;  Iran]--[Turkey won an arbitration case against Iran in a gas dispute and will receive a 13.3 to 15.8 percent discount on gas purchased from Iran between 2011 and 2015. The news was announced by Iranian Deputy Oil Minister Hamidreza Araqi as a discount around 10 to 15 percent, the country's semi-official Tasnim news agency reported yesterday morning. The minister reportedly said: "Although the court's [the International Court of Arbitration] ruling is final, the money that Iran should pay out to Turkey has not yet been determined," while estimating the compensation to be around $1 billion. Later in the day, speaking to a TV channel, Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak said that the mentioned discount will be something between 13.3 and 15.8 percent and Iran will be paying back the higher amount Turkey paid.The two sides have to agree on the exact percentage of the discount in a few months. If they fail to agree on a certain percentage, the court will make a decision on that too. Turkey currently imports about 10 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Iran – the country's second largest supplier after Russia – under a 25-year deal that was signed in 1996. However, stating that the price charged by Iran was too high, Turkey approached the International Court of Arbitration in 2012, demanding that the price be lowered by 25 percent.Iran agreed to the discount only if the imported amount of gas was increased, which Ankara rejected. The issue was therefore taken to court, which decided in Turkey's favor, setting the discount at a 10 to 15 percent, according to Araqi.In 2012, Turkey approached International Court of Arbitration with a second case, claiming that Iran's delivery was lower than the agreed amount and decided in favor of Iran. Turkey's state-run BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corporation sued Iran in 2014 over high gas prices. Winning the case, BOTAŞ received a 16.5 percent discount and a $900 million payment from Iran.The discount has led to expectations of a discount in domestic prices. Energy prices have been an issue for Turkey since they started to follow a global downward trend. Last week Albayrak said that prices, which have been declining since June 2014, will soon be reflected in domestic natural gas prices. Due to the fluctuations in energy prices over the last decade, natural gas prices have been increasing and Turks have faced very high costs. Albayrak said that the government tried to deflect these increasing costs through subsidies and, as a result, BOTAŞ has been suffering losses for years. "Recently, we have seen energy prices decreasing and, therefore, hopefully this decrease will also mean BOTAŞ can offer discounts on its price tariffs," he said.Yesterday Albayrak stated that the government has been working on a discount package for energy prices, and Iran's forced-discount will strengthen this government plan. "Hopefully, this discount will be reflected in consumer prices soon," he added.Meanwhile, Turkey's natural gas consumption reached a new high, with 235 million cubic meters burned on a daily basis last week, while many parts of the country suffered from extreme cold. According to a report by the Anadolu Agency (AA) from data compiled by the Ministry for Energy and Natural Resources, Turkey consumed a total of 1.128 billion cubic meters of natural gas between Jan. 25 and Jan. 29, which is equal to an average consumption 235 million cubic meters per day. These figures are a historic high for the national consumption of natural gas.When weather forecasts hitting minus 20 degrees Celsius just one week earlier, the Ministry for Energy and Natural Resources considered the possibility of high natural gas consumption in houses and, accordingly, ordered power plants producing electricity from natural gas to switch to using reserve fuel. Power plants started generating electricity from fuel oil or diesel oil on Jan. 21, and returned to normal operations in stages after temperatures returned normal seasonal averages.Total annual natural gas consumption stood at 48 billion cubic meters in Turkey in 2014. The Turkish Natural Gas Distributors Union Association (GAZBİR) downgraded their estimates for the coming year's annual consumption of natural gas from 51 billion cubic meters to 47.8 billion cubic meters.]

 Now given the structured event1 and news trunk1: [Hamas;  Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing;  Israel]--[Yoav Galant, a former IDF general running for Knesset with the centrist Kulanu party, charged Saturday that the government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu largely ignored the tunnel threat posed by Hamas in the Gaza Strip until Operation Protective Edge last summer.Some 30 tunnels dug under the Gaza Strip leading into Israeli territory were exposed and demolished during the war. One led into a kibbutz dining hall, another into a kindergarten in communities bordering the Palestinian enclave. Some of the tunnels were also used to ambush and attack IDF soldiers during the war.“When there are tunnels, the government knows about it and the defense minister knows about it and no one did anything, and that’s unacceptable,” Galant said at a cultural event in Beersheba, according to Ynet.]

given the structured event2 and news trunk2: [Islamic Jihad;  Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing;  Israel]--[In a tunnel deep underground the Gaza Strip, masked terrorists from Islamic Jihad are preparing for their next war with Israel.Following the 50-day summer war with Israel, Islamic Jihad, Hamas and other Gaza-based terror groups are licking their wounds.The Al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of Islamic Jihad, lost 123 terrorists in the fighting with Israel and fired some 3,300 rockets into the Jewish state. Gaza terrorists attempted to show their might by firing the Iranian made Fajr 5 missile, which has the ability to reach Tel Aviv and northern Israel.Israeli intelligence are keeping a close eye on the activities of the Gaza terror groups. Days after the announcement of a ceasefire with Israel, Hamas and Islamic Jihad boasted that they were already preparing for the next round of conflict with Israel.]

given the structured event3 and news trunk3: [Gaza;  Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing;  Israel]--[All of Israel’s past military operations in Gaza started out this way: a limited exchange of blows, a smattering of mortar shells from Gaza and Israeli air strikes on Gaza — all snowballing into another round of vicious violence with thousands of dead and wounded.The latest escalation, including several mortars fired from Gaza to Israel over the past few weeks, was foreseeable. Israeli defense officials have been telling me for weeks that Hamas was unlikely to put up with new Israeli limitations on the transfer of goods and raw materials through the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza. As it is, the situation in Gaza is desperate and even the slightest change can result in total collapse.]

given the structured event4 and news trunk4: [Israel;  Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing;  Islamic State terrorist organization]--[Israel has become increasingly concerned about the activity of Iran and its proxy—the Hezbollah terrorist group—in Syria, while Russia has been moving to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his fight against the Islamic State terrorist organization and other rebel groups.“I would say that the importance of preventing misunderstandings [between Israeli and Russian forces] is very big,” Netanyahu said after his meeting with Putin. “Israel is constantly working to prevent the transfer of advanced and deadly weaponry from Syrian territory to Hezbollah. Israel is not prepared to accept a second terrorist front that Iran is trying to build on the Golan Heights.”]

given the structured event5 and news trunk5: [Islamic Jihad;  Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing;  Israel]--[AFP reporters were allowed access into an Islamic Jihad tunnel network for the first time. Blindfolded while being transported to its entrance, once inside the tunnels are akin to a mini city, filled with interconnecting concrete passages and even “streets” to help the terrorists navigate the vast network.One of the “streets” was named after Abu Bakr al-Sadiq, the first Islamic caliph after the death of the Prophet Mohammed.An Islamic Jihad terrorist said that the group’s tunnels were of “different lengths, some with several entrances.”Gaza terror groups have successfully used the interconnected tunnel network to smuggle in illegal supplies, usually from Egypt, to build weaponry and carry out attacks against Israel. During Operation Protective Edge, the IDF said it had demolished majority of terror tunnels inside Gaza, but a few unknown ones remained active.]

given the structured event6 and news trunk6: [Wilayat Sinai;  Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing;  Russian charter plane]--[Wilayat Sinai has grown bolder since taking responsibility for downing a Russian charter plane in October, an act which killed all 244 people on board. The terror group has carried out ongoing attacks against Egyptian soldiers, overrunning military outposts and planting roadside bombs. Experts acknowledge the group’s efficacy.“They have genius strategists,” said Mohannad Sabry, an Egyptian journalist and author of a book on the Islamist insurgency in the Sinai. “If you study the map of their attacks, they obviously know what they are doing exactly, and it shows that they have a great deal of freedom of mobility.”Despite this, Egypt claims it is winning the war against ISIS in Sinai, a claim Egypt’s allies fear is suspect. There is no way of independently verifying the Egyptian claims because journalists are not allowed into the lawless Northern Sinai region.]

given the structured event7 and news trunk7: [Hamas;  Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing;  Israel]--[AdvertisementFor another thing, prepared or not, Hamas may now believe it has an urgent incentive to attack Israel again in the near future. It was widely and quite credibly argued, during and in the aftermath of 2014’s Operation Protective Edge, that Israel had narrowly avoided a devastating Hamas onslaught through the network of tunnels the terror group had set up at the time. It was suggested that Hamas had been planning to send hundreds of gunmen through those tunnels, to attack military and civilian targets, to massacre Israelis, to seize hostages — to radically remake the balance of power. It remains unclear to this day why Hamas chose not to attempt such an attack; some have argued that there was a dispute within the organization between its so-called political and military leaderships. Whatever the case, on July 22, 2014, while the war was in full swing, Labor Party leader Isaac Herzog spoke of the “unimaginable” mega-terror attack Hamas was believed to have been planning — sending hundreds of terrorists swarming through those tunnels to massacre Israelis in the Gaza-adjacent kibbutzim and moshavim. Days earlier, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said intended Hamas attacks on kibbutz kindergartens, homes and dining halls would have been “catastrophic.”With the cessation of hostilities, even as Israel was grappling and continues to grapple with the international community’s failure to understand what we face from the Gaza terror state — step forward Bernie Sanders, BDS et al — Hamas went back to concerted tunneling and rocket manufacture. It has been gaining strength at a “surprising” pace, that same unnameable senior IDF officer acknowledged in last week’s briefing. And it has been utilizing some 1,000 tunnelers, working round-the-clock six days a week.Inevitably, perhaps, it has suffered setbacks, notably including a series of tunnel collapses, and the exposure of the tunnel revealed by the IDF on Monday. Or, then again, perhaps to say “inevitably” is to miss the mark. Perhaps, Hamas may be asking itself, Israel has been making gains of its own in this relentless battle of wills. Perhaps it has found technologies to combat even Hamas’s well-constructed, deep and reinforced subterranean attack routes. (Israeli security sources were indeed quoted Monday talking about new “technologies” being utilized to find the tunnels.)And if that is the case, one can only ask, can Israel really be confident that it will determine the timing and nature of the next round of conflict with the brutal Islamists? Hamas, which insists on continuing its efforts to destroy Israel, and which demonstrates such supreme indifference to the well-being of the people of Gaza (and doubtless much cynical amusement at the naivete of the international community), may feel that, fully ready or not, now is the time to attack. That now, heaven forbid, is the time to do what it did not do prior to the 2014 war. Because otherwise, it may be gauging, Israel could be on the point of exposing and destroying more, perhaps all, of that painstakingly constructed network of attack tunnels.]

given the structured event8 and news trunk8: [Hamas;  Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing;  Israeli cities]--[AdvertisementIsrael launched Operation Protective Edge on July 8 to stop Hamas and other groups’ indiscriminate rocket fire on Israeli cities and to destroy the terror tunnels that infiltrate into Israeli territory.During the operation, Hamas rejected a number of ceasefire proposals and violated a number of those that were agreed to.Israel lost 66 soldiers and six civilians, and a Thai agricultural worker, in the month-long conflict while the Palestinian death toll surpassed 2,100, according to Hamas officials in Gaza. Israel said half of the Gaza dead were gunmen and blamed Hamas for all civilian deaths because it operated against Israel from residential areas, placing Gazans in harm’s way.]

given the structured event9 and news trunk9: [Islamic State;  Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing;  Iraq]--["The experts decide whether this needs one week, less or more," Massoum told Reuters.He emphasised that the strikes would avoid the civilian populations despite Islamic State's attempts to use civilians as human shields and clearly target its fighting positions.Islamic State, a radical Islamist movement, which seizes to establish a medieval-style caliphate across the Middle East, seized large sections of northern and western Iraq and much of eastern Syria last year.]

given the structured event10 and news trunk10: [Islamic State;  Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing;  Iraqi forces]--[Iraq Advances on Booby-Trapped Road to Tikritby VOA News March 03, 2015An Iraqi coalition is battling its way toward Tikrit for a third day, facing Islamic State snipers and roadside bombs as it flanks the extremist group's strategic stronghold north of Baghdad.With an estimated 30,000 fighters pressing toward the rebel-held city, the offensive is Iraq's largest to date in an effort to regain control of territory lost to the militants last year.According to a French news agency (AFP) report, the Islamic State group on Tuesday claimed an American citizen with the nom de guerre Abu Dawud al-Amriki launched a suicide attack against encroaching Iraqi forces near the city of Samarra, the staging ground where anti-IS forces organized the march on Tikrit. The claim could not be independently verified.]

given the structured event11 and news trunk11: [Hamas;  Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing;  Israel]--[Eyeing a fresh round of violence with Israel, the Hamas terrorist organization is sparing no effort to enhance its arsenal and train its operatives, especially from the Gaza-ruling group’s elite “Nukhbah” terror unit, a senior officer with the Israel Defense Forces Southern Command told reporters Thursday.In a briefing with military correspondents, the officer said that Hamas’s special forces currently include some 20,000 operatives. Hamas also strives to develop its drone and naval capabilities, including terrorist divers, he said, adding that the terror group was actively pursuing improved rocket-launching capabilities. But Hamas has yet to rehabilitate its pre-2014 firing abilities, which were significantly crippled during Israel’s Operation Protective Edge.]

given the structured event12 and news trunk12: [Hamas;  Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing;  Israel]--[Bennett has since clashed with Ya'alon and Prime Minister Netanyahu on security issues, criticizing them for not taking a hard enough stance. In his statement following the IDF's latest discovery, he appeared to repeat that criticism."In the two years since (Operation) Protective Edge, Hamas was not deterred from re-intensifying its efforts, as we warned," he said.Despite the IDF destroying its entire attack tunnel capabilities - and foiling a massive planned attack against Israeli civilians - Bennett warned that Hamas had turned tunnel construction into a "national priority," and was investing massively in plans to launch an even greater attack.]

given the structured event13 and news trunk13: [Palestinians;  Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing;  Israelis]--["We must not allow the two-state solution to fall apart," he said, noting that there had been no halt to Israel's settlement activity on land the Palestinians want for a future state.Peace talks collapsed in April 2014 and since then, the situation has deteriorated, with the prospects of fresh dialogue appearing more remote than ever.A wave of Palestinian knife, gun and car-ramming attacks which began on October 1 has killed 25 Israelis, while over the same period, 159 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, most while carrying out attacks although others died in clashes and demonstrations.- Recognizing Palestine? -]

given the structured event14 and news trunk14: [Gazan terrorists;  Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing;  IDF soldiers]--[The Islamic Jihad terrorist organization on Sunday denied reports that it reached an "understanding" with Israel following the escalation in clashes last week, according to which IDF soldiers could operate on the Gazan side of the security border.Gazan terrorists repeatedly fired mortars at IDF soldiers last Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, and fired a rocket on Saturday in numerous breaches of the ceasefire that ended 2014 Operation Protective Edge.The terrorists evidently opened fire because the troops were unearthing their terror tunnels meant to facilitate attacks into sovereign Israel. The IDF responded with tank fire and airstrikes.But reports that an agreement ending the clashes was reached were "completely untrue" according to Islamic Jihad leader Khalid al-Batsh, as reported by the Palestinian Ma'an News Agency.]

given the structured event15 and news trunk15: [Palestinians;  Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing;  Israelis]--[The last peace negotiations, mediated by Kerry, collapsed in April 2014, and the period since has been fraught with conflict. Since last fall, a wave of Palestinian terrorism and violence has seen the killings of some 30 Israelis — the latest being Tuvia Yanai Weissman, a 21-year-old off-duty IDF soldier, who was stabbed to death by two Palestinian teenagers in a West Bank supermarket on Thursday.Some 160 Palestinians have died in the same period, about three-quarters of them in the course of attacking Israelis.]
