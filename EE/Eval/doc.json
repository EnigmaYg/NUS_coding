        "Text": [
            "Israeli Premier Yitzhak Shamir urged Egypt Wednesday to convince its fellow Arab countries to enter into direct negotiations with Israel.",
            "\u201cEgypt, a partner to the Camp David Accords, could play a significant role by encouraging our other neighbors to follow her example and enter into face-to-face talks with us without preconditions,\u201d Shamir said after a meeting and working lunch with President Reagan at the White House.",
            "While both Reagan and Shamir, in their statements in front of the White House\u2019s diplomatic entrance, stressed that peace can be achieved only through direct negotiations, the two leaders publicly stated their differences over an international conference.",
            "\u201cOur goal now is setting in motion a process acceptable by Israel and its neighbors which can lead to a comprehensive settlement,\u201d Reagan said. He said this requires \u201cbilateral negotiations,\u201d adding that any \u201creasonable\u201d method of bringing about such negotiations should be explored, \u201cincluding an international conference.\u201d",
            "Shamir, however, said the \u201conly viable cornerstone to peace\u201d is the method used by Israel and Egypt in achieving the Camp David Accords. \u201cWe renew the call to our neighbors to join us in direct negotiations for the obtaining of peace between us,\u201d he said.",
            "DIFFERENCES ON AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM",
            "The Israeli Premier was more direct Tuesday after his meeting at the State Department with Secretary of State George Shultz, when he called the idea of an international forum \u201ca Soviet-inspired notion supported by radical Arab nations.\u201d",
            "He said such a conference, demanded by King Hussein of Jordan, \u201cwill not bring peace to our area.\u201d",
            "Shultz, admitting that the United States and Israel do not see \u201ceye-to-eye\u201d on this issue, said the U.S. believes that \u201call options\u201d that could bring about direct negotiations should be explored, including an international conference.",
            "\u201cOur objective is not an international conference, our objective is direct negotiations,\u201d Shultz stressed.",
            "Shamir differs on this issue with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who believes an international conference may be the only way to bring Jordan into talks with Israel.",
            "A senior Administration official, briefing reporters Wednesday on Shamir\u2019s talks with Shultz and Reagan, said that the U.S. is not trying to \u201cplay one side\u201d in the Israeli government against the other. He said the U.S. deals with the national unity government, headed by Shamir, as it did when Peres was Peres was Premier.",
            "\u2018REPRESENTATIVE PALESTINIANS\u2019 MUST BE INCLUDED",
            "Both Reagan and Shultz stressed that any negotiations must include \u201crepresentative Palestinians.\u201d Shamir also agreed Tuesday that negotiations should include \u201crepresentatives of Palestinians living in the area.\u201d This apparently meant Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, rather than from outside.",
            "Reagan and Shamir also said they discussed the situation of Soviet Jewry. \u201cWe took note of recent releases, but are waiting to see the gates truly opened for Jewish emigration,\u201d Reagan said.",
            "Shamir said Israel was \u201cgrateful\u201d for Reagan\u2019s efforts on behalf of \u201cour brothers and sisters\u201d in the USSR. He said the Soviet Union must continue to be pressed \u201cto let all our people return to our ancient homeland, the land of Israel.\u201d",
            "IRAN ISSUE DISCUSSED",
            "Iran was discussed by Shamir with both Reagan and Shultz. Reagan said it was agreed that Iran should be encouraged to end terrorism and the use of force. He added that it was also agreed that it was important to \u201clook to the future instead of dwelling on the past.\u201d",
            "Shamir said Tuesday that while Iran was a leading supporter of terrorism, it was an important country in the Mideast and indicated that ways should be found to exert \u201cinfluence\u201d on it.",
            "As for the U.S. sale of arms to Iran, Shultz said this was an American decision. The Administration official briefing reporters Wednesday said that Israel has agreed to cooperate with the various American investigations of the Iranian arms sales.",
            "OTHER ISSUES DISCUSSED",
            "Both Reagan and Shamir pointed to the U.S. decision to give Israel the status of a \u201cmajor non-NATO ally,\u201d which allows it to bid on Defense Department research and development contracts. Shamir called this a \u201cnew dimension to our relations.\u201d",
            "Also discussed Tuesday and Wednesday was the Israeli economy and Israel\u2019s agreement to allow the U.S. to build a relay station for the Voice of America in Israel.",
            "Not discussed, according to officials, was the case of Jonathan Pollard who was awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to spying for Israel. When Shamir was asked about the Pollard case Tuesday, he called it \u201ca very painful experience\u201d for Israel and said spying on the U.S. was \u201cnot a policy of the Israeli government.\u201d",
            "Shamir concluded his remarks to Reagan Wednesday by noting that this year was the 200th anniversary of the U.S. constitution and the 90th anniversary of the Zionist movement.",
            "\u201cBoth events have enriched the quality of our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the roots of our present relationship, joint efforts, our dreams and our confidence in the future.\u201d"

        "Text": [
            "The Cabinet called on Egypt today to continue the Jarring talks \u201cin order to reach a peace agreement between the two states.\u201d Contrary to some expectations, the Cabinet did not attach the condition that such talks be face-to-face, thus leaving Cairo free to continue the indirect procedure applied to date. But the policymakers stated unequivocally that Israel \u201cwill not\u201d restore the pre-Six-Day War borders of June 4, 1967. The resolution issued by the Cabinet today followed a debate that had begun at a special meeting last Thursday. In the resolution, the Cabinet declared that \u201cthe government of Israel views favorably the expression of the readiness of the government of Egypt to enter into a peace agreement with Israel, and expresses its own readiness for meaningful negotiations on all subjects relevant to a peace agreement between the two countries.\u201d It was reported late last week that in its Feb. 15 aide memoire to United Nations negotiator Dr. Gunnar V. Jarring, Cairo for the first time indicated a willingness to effect a peace \u201cagreement\u201d\u2013but not a peace \u201ctreaty\u201d with Israel. The Cabinet said today that \u201cthe government of Israel hopes for a positive response by Egypt and for progress in the negotiations.\u201d",
            "The resolution remarked that \u201cthe Egyptian note demonstrates the concrete differences between Egypt\u2019s positions and those of Israel, and particularly the substantial gap which exists on the issues of borders and refugees.\u201d it noted in this connection that \u201cEgypt demands total withdrawal to the armistice lines, while the position of Israel is\u2026that it will be ready to discuss the withdrawal of armed forces towards secure, recognized and agreed boundaries to be established in peace agreements.\u201d The negotiations, the Cabinet stressed, \u201cshould not be subject to prior commitments on the outstanding issues,\u201d But the key phrase in the Cabinet resolution was that Israel \u201cviews favorably\u2026the readiness of\u2026Egypt to enter into a peace agreement with Israel.\u201d The question of what to say in the statement was thrashed out informally over the weekend by Premier Golda Meir, her senior Cabinet colleagues and Yitzhak Rabin, ambassador to the United States. Rabin, who arrived here Friday on urgent summons, reportedly conveyed to Mrs. Meir his distinct impression that if Israel rejected Egypt\u2019s offer she would run the risk of losing American support. (At the airport on his arrival, Rabin told newsmen he was unaware of any special American pressure, but added: \u201cIt depends what you regard as pressure.\u201d)",
            "ALLON, EBAN, SAPIR FAVOR ACCEPTING SADAT\u2019S PROPOSAL; MRS. MEIR, GALILI OPPOSED",
            "It was understood that Mrs. Meir and her confidant, Minister Without-Portfolio Israel Galili, were against accepting Cairo\u2019s offer, whereas Deputy Premier Yigal Allon, Foreign Minister Abba Eban and Finance Minister Pinhas Sapir favored acceptance. The current position of mercurial Defense Minister Moshe Dayan is not known for certain. But despite doubts about Egypt\u2019s sincerity, the Israeli government welcomed its willingness to conclude a peace pact of some kind. A Foreign Ministry spokesman commented to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency today that Israel would never agree to restrict Jewish immigration, even if it meant the foundering of the peace talks. Egypt\u2019s UN ambassador, Dr. Mohammed H. el Zayyat, was quoted in a New York daily last week as endorsing the sovereignty of a Jewish State of Israel if her government stopped the influx of Jews.",
            "The alleged remark gave rise to speculation that such a proposal was included in Cairo\u2019s Feb. 15 message to Dr. Jarring. But Dr. Zayyat immediately told the JTA that the published story was \u201cnon-sense,\u201d and reliable sources confirmed today that the Egyptian message made no mention of immigrants. Meanwhile, political circles in Jerusalem said Jordan would soon approve Dr. Jarring\u2019s reported suggestion that Amman sign a peace accord with Israel after some territorial adjustments. And in another development, the Interparty Secretariat Against Withdrawal From Administered Territories\u2013composed of Knesset members and professionals of all parties\u2013urged the Meir administration to reject any demand for an unconditional pullback from the areas captured in the Six-Day War."

        "Text": [
            "It was just before midnight on November 30, 1977, when Yossi Alpher, then a young Mossad officer celebrating his birthday, received an urgent phone call from the office of director Yitzhak Hofi, asking him to come immediately to Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv.",
            "\u201cHe said, \u2018Sit down, I\u2019m going to tell you something that will cause you not to sleep tonight,'\u201d Alpher recalled in a recent conversation with The Times of Israel. \u201c\u2018We want to send you to Egypt,\u2019 Hofi continued in his typical dry, emotionless tone. \u2018Get your affairs in order, by noon tomorrow I\u2019m taking you to Begin.'\u201d",
            "Just 11 days earlier, Egyptian president Anwar Sadat had dazzled Israel by landing at Ben Gurion Airport and spending three days meeting with Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin, visiting Yad Vashem, speaking at the Knesset, and praying at al-Aqsa Mosque. But no mechanism was put into place to sustain bilateral contact with Egypt following Sadat\u2019s departure.",
            "At Hofi\u2019s office, Alpher learned that Sadat had requested that an Israeli representative be placed at the American Embassy in Cairo, under cover as a diplomat. According to the plan, only the US ambassador would know that the new arrival was, in fact, working for Israel.",
            "\u201cHofi and I both smiled. We knew that, at that point in time, there were only two people in the Mossad who could pass as Americans, and the other was a bit loony,\u201d recalled the Washington, DC native who emigrated to Israel as a 20-year-old in 1962. \u201cHofi laughed and said, \u2018But you\u2019re really the right guy for the job.'\u201d",

            "After a sleepless night, Alpher and his wife met with an attorney to draw up a will and a power of attorney in case he never returned from his mission. \u201cI\u2019m headed for the biggest Arab country, still an enemy, and I have absolutely no idea for how long or what sort of contact I can possibly have with my family. I told my wife: \u2018I hate to do this to you, but it\u2019s for a good cause, for peace.\u201d",
            "At noon, Alpher returned to Hofi\u2019s office, only to hear him say, \u201cWait.\u201d That word, he said, would characterize every day of the following week.",
            "\u201cFinally he said, \u2018You\u2019re not going, Carter wouldn\u2019t agree.'\u201d",
            "Advertisement",
            "Although Alpher was not to travel to Egypt, the wheels of history could not be reversed. A few days later, Israeli TV reporter Ehud Yaari flew from Athens to Cairo on an Israeli passport and was let in, soon broadcasting footage from Egypt to an astounded Israeli public. On December 25, 1977, Begin reciprocated Sadat\u2019s gesture and traveled to Ismailia, Egypt, holding a summit meeting with the Egyptian president. A diplomatic process was set in motion leading to the Camp David summit the following summer, and eventually to the signing of a historic peace treaty with Egypt in March 1979.",
            "\u201cI told my wife: \u2018I hate to do this to you, but it\u2019s for a good cause. For peace'\u201d",
            "\u201cHad I gone, I would have been there for a week or two. There would have been no need for me, because soon you could go back and forth easily. But of course, at that point in time nobody knew,\u201d Alpher said.",
            "So why did Carter, who would soon become the patron of the Camp David negotiations, refuse to allow the budding Egyptian-Israeli relations to take form in late 1977? The former US president did not respond to a request for clarification sent by The Times of Israel to the Carter Center in Atlanta. Hofi died last September at the age of 87.",
            "Alpher never spoke to Carter subsequently; nor did he discover why or how exactly the Sadat initiative was vetoed. But, soon transferred to the Iran desk at the Mossad, he is confident he knows what stood at the root of Carter\u2019s opposition to the move.",
            "\u201cCarter was on a trip of internationalizing the Arab-Israeli conflict, and doing this together with the Soviets, which is what Sadat didn\u2019t want,\u201d Alpher said. \u201cSadat was finished with the Soviets. He wanted this to be an American peace, because he wanted American money and American arms, which he eventually got.\u201d",
            "Advertisement",
            "\u201cIt took over a month for the Carter administration to give any sort of blessing to the Sadat initiative, which was never coordinated with the Americans,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Carter administration was astounded by it.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe periphery helped usher in the peace with Egypt. Sadat knew we were in Iran; he sent his messages via the shah. He knew we were in Morocco; he sent his messages via the king\u201d",
            "Sadat\u2019s willingness to come to Israel did not come out of the blue, however, argues Alpher in his new book, Periphery: Israel\u2019s Search for Middle East Allies (Rowman & Littlefield, 2015). It was facilitated through alliances forged by Israel with Morocco under King Hassan II and with Iran under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi years earlier. A meeting between Mossad director Hofi and King Hassan in the summer of 1976 led to a secret rendezvous between Hassan and prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, disguised in a blond wig to enter Morocco incognito. Rabin left Hassan a series of questions for Sadat regarding Egypt\u2019s willingness to sign a treaty with Israel. Secret meetings followed between Israeli and Egyptian leaders: First Hofi met Sadat\u2019s deputy Hassan Tohami; later Tohami met Moshe Dayan, then foreign minister in the Begin cabinet.",
            "Some of the interviewees in Alpher\u2019s book, like former Israeli ambassador to Egypt Shimon Shamir, were skeptical of Israel\u2019s Middle East periphery doctrine. By vying for alliances with distant countries, they argued, Israel was neglecting \u2014 or even impeding \u2014 realistic prospects of peace with its neighbors. But Alpher said his research found no evidence to that effect.",
            "\u201cThe periphery helped usher in the peace with Egypt. Sadat knew we were in Iran; he sent his messages via the shah. He knew we were in Morocco; he sent his messages via the king. He knew to turn to the periphery looking for an indirect address [to Israel] in the Middle East.\u201d",
            "Ironically, Alpher noted, peace with Egypt also ended Israel\u2019s reliance on the Middle Eastern periphery, which included both states (such as Sudan, Turkey, Ethiopia, Iran and Morocco) and ethnic minorities (such as the Kurds in Iraq or the Christian Maronites in Lebanon).",
            "\u201cThe minute you have peace with your neighbor, the biggest and most powerful Arab country, you don\u2019t have the same need for the periphery that you had before,\u201d he concluded. \u201cPeace with an Arab country is a thousand times more important for Israel\u2019s overall well-being than peace with a periphery country. Peace with Egypt was the beginning of the end of the periphery doctrine, and for good reason.\u201d"

        "Text": [
            "Israel\u2019s Foreign Minister Abba Eban said last night that there were two concrete issues that could be the starting point for peace negotiations between Israel and Egypt\u2013Sharm el-Sheikh and the establishment of a balance of forces in the Middle East. But he said the responsibility for starting peace talks belonged to Egypt since it was that country that initiated the belligerency of 1967. Eban made his remarks in a 45-minute telephone interview with six senior French journalists which was broadcast by Inter-Paris, the most popular French radio network shortly before the main evening news broadcast.",
            "The interview was wide-ranging and included an admission by Eban that there have been unofficial contacts between Israel and the Soviet Union but that there could be no improvement in relations between the two countries as long as Moscow persisted in its anti-Israel policies.",
            "Eban also dismissed China as a \u201cdecisive factor in the Middle East\u201d and observed that \u201cthe really important Nixon talks on the Middle East are not taking place in Peking\u201d but \u201cwill be taking place soon in Moscow,\u201d a reference to President Nixon\u2019s summit visit to the Soviet capital this May. As far as the Middle East is concerned \u201cthere are only two powers which count, the United States and the Soviet Union,\u201d Eban said.",
            "The Interview was the first appearance by a prominent Israeli statesman or public personality on the French radio in recent years. It seemed to indicate a change in form, if not in content, of French policy toward Israel. But the Israeli Foreign Minister was not optimistic about the future of Franco-Israeli relations and listed the serious obstacles in the way of improvement.",
            "POWER BALANCE THROUGH DEMILITARIZATION",
            "Eban said that peace talks with Egypt hinged on two \u201ccrucial\u201d points. The balance of power, he said, could be advanced appreciably through demilitarization of the Sinai peninsula. \u201cA lot depends on the Egyptians. If they show themselves supple and conciliatory an agreement on borders can also be arranged,\u201d he said. He said, however, that Israel must retain permanent control of Sharm el-Sheikh in view of what happened in 1967. \u201cWe have told this to Egypt in the past and we shall continue to tell her so frankly,\u201d Eban said.",
            "He said that Egypt now commands the necessary prestige to enable it to initiate peace talks and is recognized in this position by both the US and the Soviet Union. He said that Russia\u2019s position is somewhat changed as Moscow now agrees that there can be no Israeli withdrawal without \u201ca real peace being signed.\u201d But the Soviet Union still blocks a solution by opposing \u201cterritorial negotiations,\u201d he added. Eban said, \u201cI would much prefer a change of Soviet policy without secret contacts than secret contacts and no change of Russian policy.\u201d He said that China\u2019s presence in the Middle East was mainly in the field of propaganda.",
            "OBSTACLES TO ISRAELI-FRANCO AMITY",
            "Referring to Israel\u2019s problems with France, Eban said he was a \u201crealist,\u201d and that while the friction point of the Mirage dispute has now been solved, there are still two major obstacles in the way of improved Franco-Israeli relations. One is France\u2019s refusal to agree to Israel\u2019s request to come to an agreement with the European Common Market which would safeguard its exports to Europe.",
            "The other is that France is the only West European country that has expressly stated that Israel should \u201cevacuate all the occupied territories.\u201d According to Eban, \u201cSuch a prerequisite cuts off the venue to all possible compromise solutions and this actually prevents a start to negotiations.\u201d",
            "Asked about the Palestinian problem, Eban said that \u201chad to be settled by the Arabs themselves.\u201d He observed that \u201cas far as Israel is concerned, we would be glad to live alongside a Palestinian state but this is for them to decide, not for us.\u201d Eban claimed that the Soviet Union \u201chas decided to allow Jewish emigration for two reasons: because it has come to realize that it cannot smother by force their Jewishness and because of the intensity of protests throughout the world\u2019s progressive circles about this issue.\u201d"

            "Atherton, who declined to say what progress if any, has been made in the course of his shuttle diplomacy so far, did observe that there are \u201ceach time some new ideas that provide some new basis for progress.\u201d He said the U.S. would submit its own ideas if necessary.",

One paragraph is acceptable since it is identical with the Israeli draft. But we made it absolutely clear that total withdrawal to the 1967 borders or the creation of a Palestinian state were not acceptable to us.\u201d",

President Carter, in his Jan. 4 Aswan formula, proposed that the Palestinians be given the opportunity to participate in the determination of their future. Israel accepted that formulation but says now that Egypt has retreated from it.",

According to Dayan and other observers, Jordan\u2019s continued absence from peace talks is the most serious obstacle to further progress and President Anwar Sadat of Egypt seems to be making the resumption of the political talks conditional on Jordan\u2019s involvement.",
            "Owen said on his arrival that Jordan felt the talks to date were \u201cbilateral\u201d and would consider joining them only if real progress was evident. He said he thought that attitude was \u201cnot unreasonable.\u201d Owen also noted that Israel\u2019s peace plan was presented originally as a scheme \u201cfor five years,\u201d subject to review after that period.",
            "This important aspect seems to be \u201clost sight of,\u201d he said, at least in some Arab quarters where Israel\u2019s proposals \u201ctended to be seen as permanent.\u201d He urged emphasis on the five-year aspect of the Israeli plan.",

I think they are very cautious about this and I think they don\u2019t believe it necessarily requires breaking from Syria.\u201d Owen met in Amman with Crown Prince Hassan.

            "\u201cIt is hard to tell whether the Egyptians believed at the beginning of negotiations that they would eventually reach a separate agreement with Israel,\u201d Dayan said. At the moment, he told the Congress delegates, negotiations are concentrated on the Palestinian issue and the future of the West Bank and there is no discussion of bilateral matters between the two countries.",
            "Dayan said Israel did not object to President Carter\u2019s Jan. 4 Aswan formula that called for Palestinian Arab participation in determining their own future. \u201cIsrael is willing to sit with them and to discuss with them their future,\u201d Dayan said. He claimed, however, that \u201cit is quite obvious that when they speak of their future they mean that they will determine our future.\u201d He said Israel would never allow the Palestinian Arabs to determine the future of its settlements in the occupied Arab territories."

            "King Abdullah II of Jordan, Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, and Kerry were all there to attend a major Egyptian investment summit, hosted by Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. On the sidelines of the conference, however, the four men considered how to stabilize the Palestinian economy and plotted moving the peace process forward with the next Israeli government.",
            "The electoral victory of Likud, and the continuation of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s premiership, puts a damper on any peace plans\u2014especially following the Israeli leader\u2019s campaign promise to block the emergence of a Palestinian state.",
            "On numerous occasions, the last Israeli government spoke of its quiet cooperation with Egypt and other Arab states on issues of mutual interest: from countering salafi-jihadism to keeping Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.",
            "Israeli leaders pointed out that all this was happening despite a stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and contended that such under-the-table relations can thrive without efforts to solve the Palestinian issue. From the Israeli perspective, the Palestinians are simply no longer a regional priority.",
            "A recent visit to Cairo suggests Egyptian officials see things differently. Egypt needs Israel\u2019s next government to move forward on the peace process; and President el-Sisi is open to creative ways to achieve the two-state solution.",
            "Egyptian-Israeli security cooperation is closer than it has ever been as the two neighbors grapple with threats from jihadis in the Sinai Peninsula and concerns about the Gaza Strip\u2019s Hamas rulers. Mutual interests on their shared border mean little is likely to change in security ties, but no movement on the peace process will increase tensions on diplomatic fronts and widen disagreements even where interests overlap: such as Gaza.",
            "Egypt\u2019s rhetorical demands for Palestinian rights build from its historical, ethnic, and religious ties to the Palestinian people and the disputed land \u2014 especially Jerusalem. However, as one Egyptian official noted, peace between Israel and the Palestinians is also in Egypt\u2019s self-interest for internal and regional stability.",
            "President el-Sisi previously linked the Palestinian conflict to radicalism in the Middle East. The Egyptian official was more direct: Egypt\u2019s enemies, from Iran to extremist groups, use the Palestinian issue to undermine Egypt by attacking its Peace Treaty and security cooperation with Israel.",

            "Interesting in the current context is that Egypt\u2019s concern about the next Israeli-Palestinian flare-up centers on the Palestinian Authority-controlled West Bank and on Jerusalem: not on Gaza, which borders Egypt",
            "The humanitarian situation in Gaza is terrible, but Egyptian officials have limited concern about public backlash for its policies toward the Strip. For the most part, this stems from the negative image Egyptians have of Hamas: an outgrowth of the group\u2019s relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood and the Egyptian government\u2019s insistence on Hamas involvement in attacks in the Sinai Peninsula and Egypt\u2019s mainland.",
            "This shows that, as much as Egyptian officials describe the need to consider public opinion in its relations with Israel, public opinion can be shaped by the government and a sympathetic media.",

            "Advertisement",
            "Despite close ties, el-Sisi has not returned Egypt\u2019s ambassador to Tel Aviv. The diplomat was recalled during the 2012 Gaza conflict, and he will continue to work from Cairo until there is progress on the peace process. Because there is value to Israel in the appearance of normal relations with any of its neighbors, the Egyptian government could publicly link its ambassador\u2019s return with the resumption of talks between Israel and the Palestinians.",
            "At the conclusion of talks, or to get past major hurdles in the process, Egypt also holds a major trump card: Ouda Tarabin. The Bedouin citizen of Israel is nearing the end of a 15-year Egyptian sentence for spying for Israel \u2014 a charge Israel and he deny, and one he never had the opportunity to challenge in court. Israel\u2019s efforts to free its citizens imprisoned and captured abroad are well known; and Tarabin\u2019s release is a major priority for Israel in its bilateral relations with Egypt. Deporting Tarabin could induce difficult concessions from Israel; but his value is time-limited, as he completes his sentence later this year.",
            "Despite a number of other priorities and pressing matters, it is clear that el-Sisi is interested in a peace push. In October 2014 remarks to a gathering of Gaza donors, the Egyptian president delivered a message meant for the Israeli people: \u201cIt is high time to end conflict without delay and to give others their rights to establish justice so that prosperity and security could be achieved.\u201d",
            "The vision put forward by el-Sisi is a settlement based on the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, which is considered a non-starter for many Israelis. El-Sisi speaks of 1967 lines, a shared Jerusalem, and a just settlement to the Palestinian refugee issue. Netanyahu and his prospective coalition partners reject all of the API\u2019s concessions.",
            "For Cairo, then, the next Israeli government will not be a \u201cserious partner\u201d in achieving peace. The Egyptian government is likely to focus its efforts on reaching intra-Palestinian reconciliation, strengthening the Palestinian Authority, and keeping the Israeli-Palestinian conflict quiet.",
            "From Egypt\u2019s perspective, though, even when the situation is quiet the possibility of an escalation puts it in a delicate position. Above all, Egyptian president el-Sisi wants internal and regional stability. As he sees it, the stability he demands cannot be achieved as long as the Palestinian problem remains."

Foreign Minister Abba Eban informed the Cabinet today of Mr. Sisco\u2019s impending visit. Foreign Ministry officials said they have not yet been informed of the exact date of Mr. Sisco\u2019s arrival, accompanied by his assistant, Alfred Atherton. Consequently no schedule has been prepared. They said Israel was informed by the U.S. that Mr. Sisco\u2019s visit was an \u201corientation tour\u201d of the Middle East in connection with meetings to take place later at Teheran, Iran. He will stop over at London and Paris on his way to the Mideast.",
            "The U.S. State Department disclosed in Washington last week that Mr. Sisco was going to Teheran for routine consultations with the chief of the U.S. Mission in the Mideast. Department spokesman Robert J. McCloskey said at the time that while there were no definite plans to visit other countries in the region a stop-over in Egypt was emphatically ruled out. (Diplomatic sources in Cairo said over the week-end that Mr. Sisco was due there next Friday for talks with Foreign Minister Mahmoud Riad and possibly with President Gamal Abdel Nasser. He is also scheduled to visit Amman and Beirut. According to Washington sources, a Sisco meeting with Egyptian leaders would represent a new departure for the Nixon Administration since the U.S. has no diplomatic relations with Cairo.)",
            "Mr. Sisco, a career diplomat, visited Israel in the summer of 1968 when he accompanied George Ball, then U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations in the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. In the last few weeks Mr. Sisco has had several meetings with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly E. Dobrynin in what some Washington observers have termed the renewal of bilateral talks but which others have viewed as preparatory talks for the resumption of bilateral negotiations."

        "Text": [
            "Premier Menachem Begin says that Israel will honor its peace treaty commitment to withdraw from Sinai by the April 25 deadline. But his remarks, in interviews published in Maariv and Yediot Achronot today, appeared to be less than an unqualified assurance that the withdrawal would take place on schedule.",
            "According to the interviews, Begin spoke of \u201ccertain problems\u201d which have arisen with Egypt. He said \u201cthere will be no problem\u201d if they can be resolved satisfactorily by April 25. He added, however, \u201cIf we do not achieve full satisfaction, we shall have to consider the situation.\u201d",
            "This morning, Begin received a delegation of the \u201cyoung guard\u201d of his Herut faction who presented him with a petition calling on the government to consider delaying the withdrawal. The petition was signed by about 750 of the 900 delegates to the Herut \u201cyoung guard\u201d convention yesterday at which Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and Deputy Premier David Levy delivered hard-line speeches hinting at a delay unless alleged Egyptian treaty violations are rectified.",
            "A delegation spokesman said later that Begin had promised the group that he would raise the withdrawal issue at next Sunday\u2019s Cabinet meeting. He reminded them, however, that there was a binding Knesset decision approving the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt which requires Israel to be out of Sinai by April 25. He also reportedly told the Herut militants that Israel\u2019s complaints against Egypt, while serious, should not be exaggerated.",
            "The Premier\u2019s newspaper interviews were far more moderate than the speeches by Shamir, Sharon and Levy. Begin said he had not read the remarks by those ministers and that \u201cno such decision\u201d (to delay the withdrawal) has been taken by the Cabinet.",
            "HARDLINE VIEWS ADVANCED",
            "Shamir told the Herut convention yesterday that the Camp David accords must \u201cobligate all sides if they are to retain any validity.\u201d Sharon vowed that Israel would not make the slightest concessions with regard to the peace treaty violations attributed to Egypt. Levy declared, \u201cIf the withdrawal has to be postponed, then let it be postponed.\u201d",
            "Other Herut MKs took an even harder line. Yosef Rom, a member of the Knesset\u2019s Foreign Affairs and Security Committee, who visited the Yamit region of northern Sinai yesterday, told members of the movement to stop the withdrawal that he had \u201crecommended to the government that it delay the withdrawal for a month\u201d because of Egypt\u2019s behavior. He was warmly applauded. MK Yigal Cohen-Orgad, meanwhile, is trying to rally a caucus of Likud MKs who oppose the peace treaty to pressure the government to consider a postponement. But another Likud MK, Ehud Olmert, told reporters today that this caucus represented a small fraction of the Likud Knesset faction. The majority, he said, firmly believed that the political damage Israel would suffer if it delayed its pull-out from Sinai would for outweigh any benefits. Some observers here have expressed anxiety over the anti-withdrawal \u201cmomentum\u201d gathering force among rightwing politicians not previously sympathetic to the Gush Emunim militants attempting to block withdrawal. They said intense American diplomatic involvement would be required to settle matters between Egypt and Israel and were fairly confident that it would be forthcoming and would succeed.",
            "U.S. CONCERNED OVER DEVELOPMENTS",
            "One ranking American diplomat Assistant Secretary of State for Near East and South Asian Affairs Nicholas Veliotes, arrived here yesterday and has already held meetings with Begin and other top level ministers. Deputy Secretary of State Walter Stoessel, the senior State Department official after Secretary of State Alexander Haig, is due here tomorrow and will meet with Begin on Thursday.",
            "The dispatch of both men to the Middle East within a few days of each other indicated the Reagan Administration\u2019s serious concern that the Sinai withdrawal be carried out smoothly and on schedule and that Israel refrain from any military action against Palestinian bases in Lebanon. There have been unconfirmed reports that Haig himself may come to the region next week if necessary to keep the peace process from de-railing.",
            "LIST OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST EGYPT",
            "Veliotes, who visited Cairo before coming to Jerusalem, was reportedly given a long list of Israel\u2019s complaints against Egypt when he met with Begin. These include: President Hosni Mubarak\u2019s refusal to visit Jerusalem which caused his scheduled trip to Israel last month to be shelved; allegations that Egypt has deployed more troops than allowed under the peace treaty in the areas of Sinai it already controls; and charges that Egypt is drawing closer to the Palestine Liberation Organization and is helping the PLO smuggle arms from Sinai into the Gaza Strip.",
            "Israel has also taken offense to the omission of any reference to the Camp David accords and the autonomy negotiations in the speech delivered in Kuwait over the weekend by Ismet Abdel-Meguid, head of the Egyptian delegation to the non-aligned conference there.",
            "Israelis concede that most of these complaints are of long standing and have been made before. But officials here say that by \u201cignoring\u201d Israel\u2019s protests, the Egyptians have created an atmosphere of suspicion and uncertainty which Israel wants dispelled before it quits Sinai on April 25."

Zaqout even revealed that during the recent Gaza conflict, rockets had been launched into Israel from Lebanon by elements operated by the Al-Qassam Brigades.",
            "Following are excerpts from his article:",
            "\u201cIn the recent Gaza war, which lasted some two months, the Al-Qassam Brigades operated several groups in Arab countries bordering occupied Palestine, so that they could launch some rockets at cities in northern occupied Palestine and cause confusion in the assessments of the Zionist enemy.",
            "\u201cIt seems that Hamas\u2019s leadership thinks, and is planning, that every future war against the Zionist enemy will be all-out, meaning that it will encompass every inch of land in Palestine, and make matters difficult for the enemy. The leadership began preparing for this immediately after the Gaza campaign, and possibly even during it.",
            "\u201cIn this context, ties were renewed between Hamas and Hizbullah, which motivated Dr. Mahmoud Al-Zahar, a member of Hamas\u2019s political leadership, to state at a political conference recently held by Hamas\u2019s information office in northern Gaza that the movement is working to establish groups belonging to the Al-Qassam Brigades in Lebanese refugee camps close to northern Palestine.",
            "\u201cI believe that Al-Zahar\u2019s statements were made in coordination with high-ranking Hizbullah officials. Also worthy of mention is the letter sent by the fighting [Al-Qassam Brigades commander] Muhammad Deif to Hizbullah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah, asking him for crossfire in occupied Palestine from the resistance.",
            "\u201cThe question is whether Dr. Al-Zahar\u2019s statements also apply to the Palestinian presence in Syria, Jordan, and even Egypt.\u201d[2]",

The reports said that the Egyptian military units are virtually isolating the posts of the UN forces.",
            "The deployment represented the first time that substantial Egyptian forces have been in the area since UNEF contingents began to patrol the Gaza-Israel border after the 1956 seizure by Israel of the strip and subsequent withdrawal by Israel forces.",
            "It was also reported that for the past several days, substantial movements of Russian-equipped Egyptian troops have been observed from the Israel side in many sections of the Egyptian-Israel border areas. There were unconfirmed reports that two Egyptian divisions have been deployed in the Gaza Strip border area. Other Egyptian units were reported to have been stationed in Abou Ageila and Juscima, sites of sharp battles during the 1956 Sinai campaign.",

            "The Oslo Accords divided the occupied territories (minus East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed) into three distinct areas. Israel has total security access to and control of Areas B and C. The difference is only that in Area B, Palestinians are allowed administrative control, i.e., to pick up garbage and so on. Area A, which was supposed to gradually grow to cover the entire occupied territories, is under both administrative and security control of the Palestinians.

Israel, as an occupying power, will have to take responsibility for the occupied territories and the population it inherited when its troops ran over the West Bank and Gaza Strip.The Fourth Geneva Convention, which was established followed the prolonged (at the time) German occupation of France, regulates the responsibilities of an occupying power.Israeli courts refuse to accept that Palestinian areas Israeli troops control are occupied territories.",

The civil administration has continued to work in Area C, mostly in sync with the demand of the settlers and with the aim of stunting any Palestinian development and growth. Area C, which covers nearly 65 percent of the occupied territories, includes all areas outside populated cities, as well as the entire Jordan Valley, with the exception of Jericho.

            "March 6, 2015",
            "Hamas never imagined that it would be classified as a terrorist movement by an Arab country \u2014 a classification that has dangerous political, media and perhaps military repercussions.",
            "However, Egypt\u2019s Court of Urgent Matters declared Hamas a terrorist organization on Feb. 28 against the backdrop of the proven movement\u2019s implication in armed operations that claimed the lives of Egyptian officers and soldiers in Sinai Peninsula, after its members seeped through the tunnels into Egypt.",
            "Why is this decision dangerous? Egypt is considered the only leeway for Gaza where Hamas is in control. Egypt\u2019s classification of Hamas as a terrorist organization implies that all efforts are being made to cut off its arms supplies and funding by all means necessary. Moreover, whoever cooperates with Hamas is considered a criminal by law, according to a statement on March 4 by Egypt\u2019s Minister of Justice Mahfouz Saber. The law stipulates seizing Hamas properties, arresting all its affiliated members and confiscating their funds and locations.",
            "As soon as the decision was issued, Hamas condemned it and Ismail Radwan, the former minister of awqaf and religious affairs and Hamas spokesman, told Al-Monitor, \u201cThe Egyptian decision constitutes a service handed to the Israeli occupation on a silver platter. Moreover, it has exported Egypt\u2019s internal crises abroad. But Hamas won\u2019t get carried away with side wars, and its weapons will remain directed against the occupation.\u201d",
            "Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri described on Feb. 28 the Egyptian decision as shocking and dangerous. He said that it targets the Palestinian people and their resistance and turns the tables, making the occupation a friend and the Palestinian people a foe. The decision shames Egypt and tarnishes its reputation, but it will not affect Hamas\u2019 status.",
            "Hamas did not only make political statements condemning Egypt\u2019s decision, but also staged several public protests and mass marches all over the Gaza Strip after Egypt took this decision.",
            "A high-ranking security source in Gaza told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity, \u201cThe security apparatus in Gaza has in its possession documents condemning some officials in the Palestinian Authority [PA] who provided the Egyptian media with fabricated reports about an alleged role of Hamas in Egypt.\u201d",
            "However, the most important statement issued by Hamas came from its former Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh on March 3, when he underlined that Hamas is making calls to rectify the historical mistake in Egypt\u2019s decision that is in direct conflict with Egyptian-Palestinian relations. Hamas is dealing patiently and wisely with the issue to right this wrong that neither suits the Arab nation nor Palestine.",
            "Hamas has started pulling diplomatic strings from behind the scenes with influential states in the region, such as Saudi Arabia, to pressure Egypt to take back its decision. Al-Monitor had previously quoted some of Hamas\u2019 internal sources expressing optimism about Saudi Arabia\u2019s new role under the reign of King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, hoping for a more balanced stance on the part of the kingdom.",
            "Hamas is making regional calls to stop the Egyptian decision, but the problem is that its main allies in the region, notably Turkey and Qatar, have a bad and tense relationship with Egypt. Therefore, Hamas is mainly hanging its hopes on Saudi Arabia, which is the most influential player in Egypt.",
            "Egypt\u2019s decision against Hamas coincided with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia on March 1. Hamas is well aware that Egypt is careful not to anger Saudi Arabia, its main funder. Thus, Saudi Arabia has been asked to intervene to revoke Egypt\u2019s decision.",
            "Hamas has warned against expected repercussions on the ground with a possible military attack on the Gaza Strip, which according to an Egyptian anchorman close to the regime's security circles could take place on April 1.",
            "Hamas member of parliament Yahya Moussa, the chairman of the Legislative Council\u2019s Oversight Committee, told Al-Monitor, \u201cI rule out the possibility of a military attack waged by Egypt, despite information confirming otherwise. I personally believe that such a crazy act will not happen since the Egyptian regime can easily do without it.\u201d",
            "However, Mousa Abu Marzouk, the deputy chairman of Hamas\u2019 political bureau, who is currently in Egypt, said on March 1 that the Egyptian decision against Hamas is a prelude to its intention to attack Gaza.",
            "Meanwhile, Radwan told Al-Monitor, \u201cThe Gaza Strip and Hamas will not take things lying down, although we don\u2019t think the Egyptian army will get involved in massacres against Palestinians. Whoever is threatening Hamas should perhaps recall the bitter experience of the Israeli army in the face of [Izz ad-Din] al-Qassam Brigades.\u201d",
            "Hamas, despite having publicly declared the unlikelihood of an Egyptian military attack against it in Gaza, has taken precautions in case such a catastrophic scenario occurs.",
            "Maj. Gen. Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, leader of the Palestinian security forces, said on March 5 that there has been security mobilization, while security sites stretching along the border with Egypt have been fortified so as to control the border, preventing any security incident from taking place. He also denied any direct contact with the Egyptian army during the ongoing patrols and activities on the border between the two countries.",
            "The security measures by Hamas on the border with Egypt aim at preventing any infiltration from and into Sinai, as the movement fears to be dragged into an Egyptian internal conflict, which would have significantly negative consequences.",
            "Wael Attiya, Egypt\u2019s ambassador to the PA, said on March 3 that the media statements regarding the Egyptian army\u2019s intention to target certain locations in Gaza does not express the official Egyptian stance because such plans are not on the agenda of Egypt\u2019s political leadership.",
            "In the past few days, Al-Monitor has learned of an internal position assessment that Hamas was circulating, but that has not been reported in the media. The assessment stated that there were several scenarios as to how Hamas would deal with a possible Egyptian attack on Gaza. Hamas could keep silent about the possible attack that would most likely be an airstrike without a ground offensive, or it could respond in a way that is in line with the magnitude and depth of the Egyptian attack. Hamas could also direct its response at Israel, so that the latter pressures Egypt to stop its attack on Gaza.",
            "\u201cAll the previous scenarios have advantages and disadvantages, but Hamas will be careful to take the road that does not lead to a clash with the Egyptian army, as this option would be very costly,\u201d the internal assessment stated.",
            "Finally, Hamas knows very well that Egypt\u2019s recent decision against it will likely kill any chance of communication between both parties and dismiss a possible Egyptian role in the Palestinian reconciliation, truce with Israel and reconstruction of the Gaza Strip. This decision increases the possibility of an armed clash between al-Qassam Brigades and the Egyptian army, which is something that Hamas does not want.",
            "Hamas is consistently practicing restraint vis-a-vis the official Egyptian enmity against it, either by toning down and controlling its reactions and steering clear of anger, or by increasing its calls with Arab states to pressure Egypt. At the same time, it is seeking to take any step that would keep the confrontation with Egypt at bay.",

        "Text": [
            "Per a recent article in these ages \u2013 https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-offers-long-term-ceasefire-in-exchange-for-end-of-blockade/ Gazan businessmen claiming to convey messages on behalf of Hamas to Western diplomats have recently offered the possibility of a multi-year ceasefire in exchange for Israel\u2019s lifting of the blockade.",
            "Call me cynical, but I see a few problems right off the bat:",
            "1) From the article there seem to be two disparate sets of terms proposed have been proposed by different people to different diplomats \u2013 so this seems more like a trial balloon designed to elicit an Israeli on-the-record response than anything else.",
            "2) Per one set of terms, \u201c4) Hamas is interested in improved relations with the international community, and would like to discuss with it all issues related to stability and international peace.\u201d But anyone familiar with Hamas\u2019 charter could never take this seriously. Hamas\u2019 professed desire to involve the international community via Western diplomats in this effort and the quoted statement in particular must be rejected as ultra vires given that Hamas has not (to my knowledge) ever annulled its Charter \u2013 Articles 13, 15 and 34 prima facie seem to preclude any substantial settlement with Israel \u2013 especially one that involves international mediation. That\u2019s besides the fact that Article 7 of the Charter calls for genocide of the Jews, in so many words. In short, Hamas\u2019 own founding document expressly precludes/outlaws the particular activities now ascribed to the high-level Hamas officials.",
            "That any respected journalist would report this uncritically as anything serious \u2013 without even mentioning these points seems credulous, at best. Now, this kind of reportage does have years of tradition behind it. After all, when the PLO proclaimed a \u201cstate\u201d in November 1988, a state that implicitly covered all of Israel, thus making the proclamation a declaration of war, the act was reported in Israel and the West as a conciliatory and moderate statement. Still, one would think the serious journalists might have had learned something in the past 25 years, or so.",
            "One last point:",
            "3) The term referenced by the article is \u2018Tahadiyah\u2019 \u2013 not a theological term (which Hamas as a theological group might feel bound by), but a modern concept Hamas has appealed to before in 2009 for those can remember. It means \u2018calm\u2019 or \u2018lull\u2019 \u2013 not really a \u2018cease fire\u2019. Per Micha Halpern, \u201cThe word implies a reduction, not a stoppage, of aggression. The concept of Tahadiyah implies that there is plenty of wiggle room. Tahadiyah is not quiet nor is it a commitment to enforce a quiet. Quite to the contrary a Tahadiyah actually allows for attacks and a gradual increase of pressure and a change in the status quo over time. It is a very ambiguous and amorphous term that translates into a very ambiguous and amorphous status on the ground.\u201d",
            "In short, this offer is an invitation to formalize what Israel has endured since 2005. Nothing substantive is being offered because whenever Hamas has used the word Tahadiyah in the past rockets have continued to fly or re-arming has proceeded at a feverish pace. Only in the Arab-Israeli conflict has the world become accepting of a certain level of rocket fire aimed at civilians as \u2018normal\u2019. This absurd state of affairs should hardly be institutionalized with our acquiescence. Instead, Hamas should be called to respond to points raised above.",
            "Hamas started a war, violated 11 ceasefires, and lost. This appeal to Israel \u2013 designed to provide Hamas time and cover to replenish its arms and continue \u201clow level\u201d rocket fire \u2013 is an \u201coffer\u201d that should be treated with precisely the disdain it deserves."

            "GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip \u2014 Talks about a long-term truce between Hamas and Israel have surfaced again after it was revealed that there had been an initiative to reach an understanding that could last for years, in return of achieving complete stability on the Israeli borders with the Gaza Strip, and ending the siege.",
            "The initiative was made about two months ago by Robert Serry, UN special coordinator for the peace process in the Middle East, between the main parties, Hamas and Israel, as well as the Palestinian Authority (PA) in Ramallah and Egypt, the recent war\u2019s cease-fire agreement sponsor.",
            "Hamas quickly denied proposing a truce with Israel for five years, in return for ending the siege, according to what the Israeli website Walla published. But at the same time, it noted that a similar initiative was made by foreign parties, whose names it did not mention in its official statement. Serry himself had confirmed that he made the initiative during a meeting with a number of Palestinian journalists in Gaza City.",
            "The initiative included a truce that would last four to five years, under the umbrella of the Palestinian unity government led by Rami Hamdallah. During this period, the Gaza Strip would be reconstructed and all military activity above ground and underground (tunnels) would be halted. In return, the Rafah crossing would be reopened and the Israeli siege that has lasted for over seven years would end.",
            "Mousa Abu Marzouk, the deputy chairman of Hamas\u2019 political bureau, denied on Twitter the existence of any agreement or initiative. But a source who participated in the meeting held by the UN envoy to Gaza confirmed that a truce was proposed to Hamas.",
            "Abu Marzouk tweeted: \u201cWe did not give our approval to any of the parties that spread the news. This is not on our agenda because our national responsibility, the unity of our cause and its future are undisputable.\u201d",
            "Serry\u2019s proposal included a long-term cease-fire for the sake of the Gaza Strip\u2019s reconstruction, since countries are not up to donating money for the reconstruction of buildings that might be destroyed again in another round of war unless there is a guarantee that it won\u2019t happen again.",
            "The proposal also included the Palestinian government\u2019s participation, which means that Hamdallah\u2019s government would have the freedom to operate in the Gaza Strip without any interference.",
            "A prominent Hamas source explained the situation to Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity, saying \u201cTwo meetings were held between Hamas and the UN envoy, Serry. The first was around two months ago, attended by three Hamas leaders, during which the initiative was presented to them. The envoy gave them two printed copies of the initiative, one in Arabic and the other in English. The second meeting was held at the beginning of this month [March], attended by Hamas\u2019 Gaza leader Ismail Haniyeh, during which the initiative\u2019s outlines were discussed.\"",
            "He added, \u201cSerry was serious in his initiative. He wanted to leave office by accomplishing an achievement on the ground and he wanted the concerned parties to reach a truce that would guarantee achieving stability. However, the fact that he is leaving office at the end of this month [March] might impede the success of this initiative, especially in light of the changes in the Israeli political map following the general elections.\u201d",
            "The source noted that the proposed initiative is indeed on the table of discussion of Hamas\u2019 political bureau and the movement did not reject it. The initiative can be achieved in light of specific details since the outlines have been agreed upon, but certain definitions and further details for a number of proposed points must be added.",
            "Hamas does not mind implementing the current fragile calm agreement that was set since the Egyptian-sponsored cease-fire was announced in Cairo following last year's 50-day war, which was supposed to be more thoroughly discussed; however, the current security events in the Sinai Peninsula and in Egypt are still preventing that.",
            "The head of Hamas\u2019 political bureau and the leader of the military wing in the Gaza Strip both noted that their movement does not wish to renew the confrontation with Israel at this moment. On Feb. 24, Haniyeh said, \u201cHamas is not concerned with a new confrontation with the occupation.\u201d The same was expressed by Marwan Issa, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades leader, at the same place during his speech, when he said, \u201cWe do not currently seek to have further confrontations with the Israeli occupation.\u201d",
            "The same source told Al-Monitor, \u201cHamas cannot give clear and explicit answers, or agree to a long-term truce due to the Israeli elections, since the form and the policies of the future Israeli government toward the Gaza Strip are still unknown.\u201d",
            "Al-Monitor Israel Pulse columnist Shlomi Eldar wrote, \u201cIn my assessment, no Israeli leader \u2014 not incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and not even Zionist Camp leader Isaac Herzog should he be elected \u2014 would be willing to open the passages to Gaza merely on the basis of a Hamas promise of a cease-fire. Considering Hamas' current situation, it needs to go the distance and make some far-reaching changes if it wants to save Gaza residents, and itself.\u201d",
            "Hamas does not seem eager to engage in a new confrontation with Israel any time soon in light of the current political complications on the internal Palestinian scene, in addition to the changes of the situation in the region.",
            "However, Hamas aims to show that it is renewing its military power and sending signals, almost on a daily basis, whether through statements or by trying out its locally made rockets in the sea, to prove that it was not defeated in the recent war."

            "The directive was the latest in a series of phased civil defense preparations that have been implemented over the past several months. They included a campaign calling on the population to update their gas mask kits, an information booklet on preparing a sealed room and what to do in the event of attack, and an advisory to stock up on supplies needed to prepare sealed rooms.",
